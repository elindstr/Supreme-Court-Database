															ALLEN RYAN ALLEYNE, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 17, 2013]

															

															     Justice Breyer,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															     Eleven years ago, in
Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002) , I wrote that
“I cannot easily distinguish Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530
U. S. 466 (2000) , from this case in terms of logic.”
Id., at 569 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). I nonetheless accepted Harris’ holding because I
could “[n]ot yet accept [Ap-prendi’s] rule.” 536
U. S., at 569. I continue to disagree with Apprendi. See 536
U. S., at 569–570; United States v. Booker, 543
U. S. 220, 326 (2005) (opinion dissenting in part); Blakely v.
Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 328 (2004) (dissenting opinion);
Apprendi, supra, at 555 (same). But Apprendi has now defined the
relevant legal regime for an additional decade. And, in my view,
the law should no longer tolerate the anomaly that the
Apprendi/Harris distinction creates.

															     The Court’s basic
error in Apprendi, I believe, was its failure to recognize the
law’s traditional distinction between elements of a crime
(facts constituting the crime, typically for the jury to determine)
and sentencing facts (facts affecting the sentence, often
concerning, e.g., the manner in which the offender committed the
crime, and typically for the judge to determine). The early
historical references that this Court’s opinions have set
forth in favor of Apprendi refer to offense elements, not to
sentencing facts. Thus, when Justice Story wrote that the Sixth
Amendment’s guarantee of trial by jury offered
“ ‘securit[y] against the prejudices of
judges,’ ” post, at 4 (Roberts, C. J.,
dissenting) (quoting Commentaries on the Consti-tution of the
United States §924, p. 657 (Abr. 1833)), he was likely
referring to elements of a crime; and the best answer to Justice
Scalia’s implicit question in Apprendi—what, exactly,
does the “right to trial by jury” guarantee?—is
that it guarantees a jury’s determination of facts that
constitute the elements of a crime. 530 U. S., at
498–499 (concurring opinion).

															     Although I have set
forth these minority views be- fore, see Booker, supra, at 326
(opinion dissenting in part); Blakely, supra, at 328 (dissenting
opinion); Apprendi, su-pra, at 555 (same), I repeat this point now
to make clear why I cannot accept the dissent’s
characterization of the Sixth Amendment as simply seeking to
prevent “judicial overreaching” when sentencing facts
are at issue, post, at 4. At the very least, the Amendment seeks to
protect defendants against “the wishes and opinions of the
government” as well. Ibid. (quoting Story, supra, §924,
at 657). And, that being so, it seems to me highly anomalous to
read Apprendi as insisting that juries find sentencing facts that
permit a judge to impose a higher sentence while not insisting that
juries find sentencing facts that require a judge to impose a
higher sentence. See Harris, supra, at 569–570 (opinion of
Breyer, J.).

															     To overrule Harris and
to apply Apprendi’s basic jury-determination rule to
mandatory minimum sentences would erase that anomaly. Where a
maximum sentence is at issue, Apprendi means that a judge who
wishes to im-pose a higher sentence cannot do so unless a jury
finds the requisite statutory factual predicate. Where a manda-
tory minimum sentence is at issue, application of Apprendi would
mean that the government cannot force a judge who does not wish to
impose a higher sentence to do so unless a jury finds the requisite
statutory factual predicate. In both instances the matter concerns
higher sentences; in both instances factfinding must trigger the
increase; in both instances jury-based factfinding would act as a
check: in the first instance, against a sentencing judge wrongly
imposing the higher sentence that the judge believes is
appropriate, and in the second instance, against a sentencing judge
wrongly being required to impose the higher sentence that the judge
believes is inappropriate.

															     While Harris has been
the law for 11 years, Apprendi has been the law for even longer;
and I think the time has come to end this anomaly in
Apprendi’s application. Consequently, I vote to overrule
Harris. I join Parts I, III–B, III–C, and IV of the
Court’s opinion and concur in its judgment.
