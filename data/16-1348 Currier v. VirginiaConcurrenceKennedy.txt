															MICHAEL NELSON CURRIER, PETITIONER v. VIRGINIA

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of virginia

															[June 22, 2018]

															

															Justice Kennedy, concurring in part.

															I join Parts I and II of the Court’s opinion, which, in my view, suffice to resolve this case in a full and proper way.

															There is a strong public “interest in giving the prosecution one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws.”  Arizona v. Washington,

434 U. S. 497, 509 (1978).  The reason that single opportunity did not occur in one trial here was because both parties consented to sever the possession charge to avoid introducing evidence of petitioner’s prior conviction during his trial for burglary and larceny.  Petitioner acknowledges that by consenting to severance he cannot argue that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the second trial.  See Brief for Petitioner 9–10.  He instead contends that, even though he consented to severance, he preserved the double jeopardy protections applied in Ashe v. Swenson,

397 U. S. 436 (1970), protections that, in Ashe, were a bar to relitigation of factual issues adjudicated in a previous trial.

															The Double Jeopardy Clause reflects the principle that “the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individ- ual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.”  Green v. United States,

355 U. S. 184, 187–188 (1957).  But this “is not a principle which can be expanded to include situations in which the defendant is responsible for the second prosecution.”  United States v. Scott,

437 U. S. 82, 95–96 (1978); see also id., at 99 (The “Clause, which guards against Government oppression, does not relieve a defendant from the consequences of his voluntary choice”).  This rule recurs throughout the Court’s double jeopardy cases, see, e.g., Jeffers v. United States,

432 U. S. 137, 152 (1977); Ohio v. Johnson,

467 U. S. 493, 500, n. 9, 502 (1984); Evans v. Michigan,

568 U. S. 313, 326 (2013), and, in my view, it controls here.

															The end result is that when a defendant’s voluntary choices lead to a second prosecution he cannot later use the Double Jeopardy Clause, whether thought of as protecting against multiple trials or the relitigation of issues, to forestall that second prosecution.  The extent of the Double Jeopardy Clause protections discussed and defined in Ashe need not be reexamined here; for, whatever the proper formulation and implementation of those rights are, they can be lost when a defendant agrees to a second prosecution.  Of course, this conclusion is premised on the defendant’s having a voluntary choice, and a different result might obtain if that premise were absent.  Cf. Turner v. Arkansas,

407 U. S. 366, 367 (1972) (per curiam) (applying Ashe to a second trial where state law prohibited a single trial of the charges at issue).
