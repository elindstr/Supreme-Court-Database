															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															ROMAG FASTENERS, INC., PETITIONER v. FOSSIL, INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[April 23, 2020]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring in the judgment.

															I agree that

15 U. S. C. §1117(a) does not impose a “willfulness” prerequisite for awarding profits in trademark infringement actions.  Courts of equity, however, defined “willfulness” to encompass a range of culpable mental states—including the equivalent of recklessness, but excluding “good faith” or negligence.  See 5 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition §30:62 (5th ed. 2019) (explaining that “willfulness” ranged from fraudulent and knowing to reckless and indifferent behavior); see also, e.g., Lawrence-Williams Co. v. Societe Enfants Gombault et Cie, 52 F.2d 774, 778 (CA6 1931); Regis v. Jaynes, 191 Mass. 245, 248–249, 77 N.E. 774, 776 (1906).

															The majority suggests that courts of equity were just as likely to award profits for such “willful” infringement as they were for “innocent” infringement.  Ante, at 5–6.  But that does not reflect the weight of authority, which indicates that profits were hardly, if ever, awarded for innocent infringement.  See, e.g., Wood v. Peffer, 55 Cal. App. 2d 116, 125 (1942) (explaining that “equity constantly refuses, for want of fraudulent intent, the prayer for an accounting of profits”); Globe-Wernicke Co. v. Safe-Cabinet Co., 110 Ohio St. 609, 617, 144 N.E. 711, 713 (1924) (“By the great weight of authority, particularly where the infringement . . . was deliberate and willful, it is held that the wrongdoer is required to account for all profits realized by him as a result of his wrongful acts”); Dickey v. Mutual Film Corp., 186 App. Div. 701, 702, 174 N.Y.S. 784 (1919) (declining to award profits because there was “no proof of any fraudulent intent upon the part of the defendant”); Standard Cigar Co. v. Goldsmith, 58 Pa. Super. 33, 37 (1914) (reasoning that a defendant “should be compelled to account for . . . profits” where “the infringement complained of was not the result of mistake or ignorance of the plaintiff ’s right”). Nor would doing so seem to be consistent with longstanding equitable principles which, after all, seek to deprive only wrongdoers of their gains from misconduct.  Cf. Duplate Corp. v. Triplex Safety Glass Co.,

298 U.S. 448, 456–457 (1936).  Thus, a district court’s award of profits for innocent or good-faith trademark infringement would not be consonant with the “principles of equity” referenced in §1117(a) and reflected in the cases the majority cites.  Ante at 6–7.

															Because the majority is agnostic about awarding profits for both “willful” and innocent infringement as those terms have been understood, I concur in the judgment only.
