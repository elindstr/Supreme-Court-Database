															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring in all but Part
III–B–1.

															I agree with the Court that Alabama’s
redistricting plan violates §2 of the Voting Rights Act as
interpreted in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S.
30 (1986). I write separately to emphasize four points.

															First, the upshot of Alabama’s
argument is that the Court should overrule Gingles. But the
stare decisis standard for this Court to overrule a
statutory precedent, as distinct from a constitutional precedent,
is comparatively strict. Unlike with constitutional precedents,
Congress and the President may enact new legislation to alter
statutory precedents such as Gingles. In the past 37 years,
however, Congress and the President have not disturbed
Gingles, even as they have made other changes to the Voting
Rights Act. Although statutory stare decisis is not
absolute, “the Court has ordinarily left the updating or
correction of erroneous statutory precedents to the legislative
process.” Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S.
___, ___ (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in part) (slip op., at
4); see also, e.g., Kimble v. Marvel
Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.S. 446, 456 (2015); Patterson
v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S.
164, 172–173 (1989); Flood v. Kuhn,
407 U.S.
258, 283–284 (1972); Burnet v. Coronado Oil
& Gas Co., 285 U.S.
393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).[1]

															Second, Alabama contends that
Gingles inevitably requires a proportional number of
majority-minority districts, which in turn contravenes the
proportionality disclaimer in §2(b) of the Voting Rights Act.
52 U. S. C. §10301(b). But Alabama’s premise
is wrong. As the Court’s precedents make clear,
Gingles does not mandate a proportional number of
majority-minority districts. Gingles requires the creation
of a majority-minority district only when, among other things, (i)
a State’s redistricting map cracks or packs a large and
“geographically compact” minority population and (ii) a
plaintiff ’s proposed alternative map and proposed
majority-minority district are “reasonably
configured”—namely, by respecting compactness
principles and other traditional districting criteria such as
county, city, and town lines. See, e.g., Cooper v.
Harris, 581 U.S. 285, 301–302 (2017); Voinovich
v. Quilter, 507 U.S.
146, 153–154 (1993); ante, at 10–12,
18–22.

															If Gingles demanded a proportional number
of majority-minority districts, States would be forced to group
together geographically dispersed minority voters into unusually
shaped districts, without concern for traditional districting
criteria such as county, city, and town lines. But Gingles
and this Court’s later decisions have flatly rejected that
approach. See, e.g., Abbott v. Perez, 585
U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (slip op., at 33–34);
Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S.
952, 979 (1996) (plurality opinion); Gingles, 478
U. S., at 50; see also Miller v. Johnson,
515 U.S.
900, 917–920 (1995); Shaw v. Reno,
509 U.S.
630, 644–649 (1993); ante, at
18–22.[2]

															Third, Alabama argues that courts should
rely on race-blind computer simulations of redistricting maps to
assess whether a State’s plan abridges the right to vote on
account of race. It is true that computer simulations might help
detect the presence or absence of intentional
discrimination. For example, if all of the computer simulations
generated only one majority-minority district, it might be
difficult to say that a State had intentionally discriminated on
the basis of race by failing to draw a second majority-minority
district.

															But as this Court has long recognized—and
as all Members of this Court today agree—the text of §2
establishes an effects test, not an intent test. See ante,
at 17; post, at 7 (Thomas, J., dissenting); post, at
16 (Alito, J., dissenting). And the effects test, as applied by
Gingles to redistricting, requires in certain circumstances
that courts account for the race of voters so as to prevent the
cracking or packing—whether intentional or not—of large
and geographically compact minority populations. See Abbott,
585 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4); Johnson v. De
Grandy, 512 U.S.
997, 1006–1007, 1020 (1994); Voinovich, 507
U. S., at 153–154; see generally Brnovich v.
Democratic National Committee, 594 U. S. ___, ___
(2021) (slip op., at 22) (“§2 does not demand proof of
discriminatory purpose”); Reno v. Bossier Parish
School Bd., 520 U.S.
471, 482 (1997) (Congress “clearly expressed its desire
that §2 not have an intent component”);
Holder v. Hall, 512 U.S.
874, 923–924 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)
(§2 adopts a “ ‘results’ test, rather
than an ‘intent’ test”); Chisom v.
Roemer, 501 U.S.
380, 394, 404 (1991) (“proof of intent is no longer
required to prove a §2 violation” as “Congress
made clear that a violation of §2 could be established by
proof of discriminatory results alone”); Gingles, 478
U. S., at 71, n. 34 (plurality opinion) (§2 does not
require “ ‘purpose of racial
discrimination’ ”).

															Fourth, Alabama asserts that §2, as
construed by Gingles to require race-based redistricting in
certain circumstances, exceeds Congress’s remedial or
preventive authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.
As the Court explains, the constitutional argument presented by
Alabama is not persuasive in light of the Court’s precedents.
See ante, at 33–34; see also City of Rome v.
United States, 446 U.S.
156, 177–178 (1980). Justice Thomas notes, however, that
even if Congress in 1982 could constitutionally authorize
race-based redistricting under §2 for some period of time, the
authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend
indefinitely into the future. See post, at 44–45
(dissenting opinion). But Alabama did not raise that temporal
argument in this Court, and I therefore would not consider it at
this time.

															For those reasons, I vote to affirm, and I
concur in all but Part III–B–1 of the Court’s
opinion.

Notes
1
 Unlike ordinary statutory
precedents, the “Court’s precedents applying common-law
statutes and pronouncing the Court’s own interpretive methods
and principles typically do not fall within that category of
stringent statutory stare decisis.” Ramos, 590
U. S., at ___, n. 2 (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.) (slip op.,
at 5, n. 2); see also, e.g., Kisor v.
Wilkie, 588 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2019) (Gorsuch,
J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 34–36); id.,
at ___–___ (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op.,
at 1–2); Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v.
PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S.
877, 899–907 (2007); Arbaugh v. Y & H
Corp., 546 U.S.
500, 510–516 (2006).

 To ensure that
Gingles does not improperly morph into a proportionality
mandate, courts must rigorously apply the “geographically
compact” and “reasonably configured”
requirements. See ante, at 22 (§2 requirements under
Gingles are “exacting”). In this case, for
example, it is important that at least some of the
plaintiffs’ proposed alternative maps respect county lines at
least as well as Alabama’s redistricting plan. See
ante, at 12.
