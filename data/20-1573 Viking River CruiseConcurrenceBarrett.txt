															VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC., PETITIONER v. ANGIE MORIANA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of california, second appellate district

															[June 15, 2022]

															

															Justice Barrett, with whom Justice Kavanaugh joins, and with whom The Chief Justice joins except as to the footnote, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I join Part III of the Court’s opinion.  I agree that reversal is required under our precedent because PAGA’s procedure is akin to other aggregation devices that cannot be imposed on a party to an arbitration agreement.  See, e.g., Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l Corp.,

559 U.S. 662 (2010); AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion,

563 U.S. 333 (2011); Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U. S. ___ (2018); Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 587 U. S. ___ (2019).  I would say nothing more than that.  The discussion in Parts II and IV of the Court’s opinion is unnecessary to the result, and much of it addresses disputed state-law questions as well as arguments not pressed or passed upon in this case.[1]*
