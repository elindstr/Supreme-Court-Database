															     Justice Breyer and
Justice Kagan, dissenting.

															     We agree with Justice
Ginsburg that the plaintiffs’ challenge to the contraceptive
coverage requirement fails on the merits. We need not and do not
decide whether either for-profit corporations or their owners may
bring claims under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.
Accordingly, we join all but Part III–C–1 of Justice
Ginsburg’s dissenting opinion.
