															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															COMMIL USA, LLC, PETITIONER v.CISCO
SYSTEMS, INC.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[May 26, 2015]

															

															Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice
joins, dissenting.

															I agree with the Court’s rejection of the
main argument advanced by Commil and the United States, that
induced infringement under 35 U. S. C. §271(b) does
not “requir[e] knowledge of the infringing nature of the
induced acts.” Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 9; see also Brief for Petitioner 15–44.I disagree,
however, with the Court’s holding that good-faith belief in a
patent’s invalidity is not a defense to induced
infringement.

															Infringing a patent means invading a
patentee’s exclusive right to practice his claimed invention.
Crown Die & Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine
Works, 261 U. S. 24, 40 (1923) (quoting 3 W. Robinson, Law
of Patents §937, pp. 122–123 (1890)). Only valid patents
confer this right to exclusivity—invalid patents do not.
FTC v. Actavis, Inc., 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)
(slip op., at 8). It follows, as night the day, that only valid
patents can be infringed. To talk of infringing an invalid patent
is to talk nonsense.

															Induced infringement, we have said,
“requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent
infringement.” Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB
S. A., 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10).
Because only valid patents can be infringed, anyone with a
good-faith belief in a patent’s invalidity necessarily
believes the patent cannot be infringed. And it is
impossible for anyone who believes that a patent cannot be
infringed to induce actions that he knows will infringe it.
A good-faith belief that a patent is invalid is therefore a defense
to induced infringement of that patent.

															The Court makes four arguments in support of the
contrary position. None seems to me persuasive. First, it notes
that the Patent Act treats infringement and validity as distinct
issues. Ante, at 9–10. That is true. It is also
irrelevant. Saying that infringement cannot exist without a valid
patent does not “conflate the issues of infringement and
validity,” ante, at 10, any more than saying that
water cannot exist without oxygen “conflates” water and
oxygen. Recognizing that infringement requires validity is entirely
consistent with the “long-accepted truth . . . that
infringement and invalidity are separate matters under patent
law.” Ibid.

															The Court next insists that permitting the
defense at issue would undermine the statutory presumption of
validity. Ante, at 10–11. It would do no such thing.
By reason of the statutory presumption of validity, §282(a),
patents can be held invalid only by “clear and convincing
evidence.” Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd.
Partnership, 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 1).
This presumption is not weakened by treating a good-faith belief in
invalidity as a defense to induced infringement. An alleged inducer
who succeeds in this defense does not thereby call a patent’s
validity into question. He merely avoids liability for a third
party’s infringement of a valid patent, in no way
undermining that patent’s presumed validity.

															Next, the Court says that “invalidity is
not a defense to infringement, it is a defense to liability.”
Ante, at 11. That is an assertion, not an argument. Again,
to infringe a patent is to invade the patentee’s right of
exclusivity. An invalid patent confers no such right. How is it
possible to interfere with rights that do not exist? The Court has
no answer.

															That brings me to the Court’s weakest
argument: that there are “practical reasons not to
create a defense based on a good-faith belief in
invalidity.” Ante, at 12 (emphasis added); see also
ibid. (“Creating a defense of belief in
invalidity, furthermore, would have negative consequences”
(emphasis added)). Ours is not a common-law court.Erie R.
Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78 (1938) . We do
not, or at least should not, create defenses to statutory
liability—and that is not what this dissent purports to do.
Our task is to interpret the Patent Act, and to decide whether
it makes a good-faith belief in a patent’s invalid-ity
a defense to induced infringement. Since, as we said in
Global-Tech, supra, the Act makes knowledge of
infringement a requirement for induced-infringement liability; and
since there can be no infringement (and hence no knowledge of
infringement) of an invalid patent; good-faith belief in invalidity
is a defense. I may add, however, that if the desirability of the
rule we adopt were a proper consideration, it is by no means clear
that the Court’s holding, which increases the in
terrorem power of patent trolls, is preferable. The Court
seemingly acknowledges that consequence in Part III of its
opinion.

															For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully
dissent.
