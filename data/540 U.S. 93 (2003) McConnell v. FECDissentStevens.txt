for the district of columbia

															[December 10, 2003]

															   Justice Stevens, dissenting with
respect to §305.*

															   The Chief Justice, writing for
the Court, concludes that the McConnell plaintiffs lack standing to
challenge §305 of BCRA because Senator McConnell cannot be
affected by the provision until “45 days before the
Republican primary election in 2008.” Ante, at 4. I
am not persuaded that Article III’s case-or-controversy
requirement imposes such a strict temporal limit on our
jurisdiction. By asserting that he has run attack ads in the past,
that he plans to run such ads in his next campaign, and that
§305 will adversely affect his campaign strategy, Senator
McConnell has identified a “concrete,”
“ ‘distinct,’ ” and
“ ‘actual’ ” injury,
Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155
(1990). That the injury is distant in time does not make it
illusory.

															   The second prong of the standing
inquiry—whether the alleged injury is fairly traceable to the
defendants’ challenged action and not the result of a third
party’s independent choices†
