															 [June 18, 2020]

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part.

															The majority rightly holds that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) violated the Administrative Procedure Act in rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  But the Court forecloses any challenge to the rescission under the Equal Protection Clause.  I believe that determination is unwarranted on the existing record and premature at this stage of the litigation.  I would instead permit respondents to develop their equal protection claims on remand.

															Respondents’ equal protection challenges come to us in a preliminary posture.  All that respondents needed to do at this stage of the litigation was state sufficient facts that would “allo[w a] court to draw the reasonable inference that [a] defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal,

556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  The three courts to evaluate respondents’ pleadings below held that they cleared this modest threshold.  908 F.3d 476, 518–520 (CA9 2018) (affirming the District Court’s denial of the Government’s motion to dismiss); see also Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen, 291 F. Supp. 3d 260, 274 (EDNY 2018).

															I too would permit respondents’ claims to proceed on remand.  The complaints each set forth particularized facts that plausibly allege discriminatory animus.  The plurality disagrees, reasoning that “[n]one of these points, either singly or in concert, establishes a plausible equal protection claim.”  Ante, at 27.  But it reaches that conclusion by discounting some allegations altogether and by narrowly viewing the rest.

															First, the plurality dismisses the statements that President Trump made both before and after he assumed office.  The Batalla Vidal complaints catalog then-candidate Trump’s declarations that Mexican immigrants are “people that have lots of problems,” “the bad ones,” and “criminals, drug dealers, [and] rapists.”  291 F. Supp. 3d, at 276 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Regents complaints additionally quote President Trump’s 2017 statement comparing undocumented immigrants to “animals” responsible for “the drugs, the gangs, the cartels, the crisis of smuggling and trafficking, [and] MS13.”  298 F. Supp. 3d 1304, 1314 (ND Cal. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The plurality brushes these aside as “unilluminating,” “remote in time,” and having been “made in unrelated contexts.”  Ante, at 28.

															But “nothing in our precedent supports [the] blinkered approach” of disregarding any of the campaign statements as remote in time from later-enacted policies.  Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2018) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11, n. 3).  Nor did any of the statements arise in unrelated contexts.  They bear on unlawful migration from Mexico—a keystone of President Trump’s campaign and a policy priority of his administration—and, according to respondents, were an animating force behind the rescission of DACA.  Cf. ibid. (noting that Presidential Proclamation No. 9645, 82 Fed. Reg. 45161 (2017), which barred entry of individuals from several Muslim-majority countries, was an outgrowth of the President’s campaign statements about Muslims).  Taken together, “the words of the President” help to “create the strong perception” that the rescission decision was “contaminated by impermissible discriminatory animus.”  585 U. S., at ___ (opinion of Sotomayor, J.) (slip op., at 13).  This perception provides respondents with grounds to litigate their equal protection claims further.

															Next, the plurality minimizes the disproportionate impact of the rescission decision on Latinos after considering this point in isolation.  Ante, at 28 (“Were this fact sufficient to state a claim, virtually any generally applicable immigration policy could be challenged on equal protection grounds”).  But the impact of the policy decision must be viewed in the context of the President’s public statements on and off the campaign trail.  At the motion-to-dismiss stage, I would not so readily dismiss the allegation that an executive decision disproportionately harms the same racial group that the President branded as less desirable mere months earlier.

															Finally, the plurality finds nothing untoward in the “specific sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision.”  Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,

429 U.S. 252, 267 (1977).  I disagree.  As late as June 2017, DHS insisted it remained committed to DACA, even while rescinding a related program, the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents.  App. 718–720.  But a mere three months later, DHS terminated DACA without, as the plurality acknowledges, considering important aspects of the termination.  The abrupt change in position plausibly suggests that something other than questions about the legality of DACA motivated the rescission decision.  Accordingly, it raises the possibility of a “significant mismatch between the decision . . . made and the rationale . . . provided.”  Department of Commerce v. New York, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 26).  Only by bypassing context does the plurality conclude otherwise.

															*  *  *

															The facts in respondents’ complaints create more than a “sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Iqbal, 556 U. S., at 678.  Whether they ultimately amount to actionable discrimination should be determined only after factual development on remand.  Because the Court prematurely disposes of respondents’ equal protection claims by overlooking the strength of their complaints, I join all but Part IV of the opinion and do not concur in the corresponding part of the judgment.
