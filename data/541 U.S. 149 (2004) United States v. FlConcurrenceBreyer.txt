															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. MANUEL 
FLORES-MONTANO

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[March 30, 2004]



															   Justice Breyer, concurring.

															
   I join the Court’s opinion in full.  I also note that Customs keeps track of the border searches its agents conduct, including the reasons for the searches.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 53–54.  This administrative process should help minimize concerns that gas tank searches might be undertaken in an abusive manner.
