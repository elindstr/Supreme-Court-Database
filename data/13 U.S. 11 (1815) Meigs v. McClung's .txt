ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT
FOR
THE DISTRICT OF EAST
TENNESSEE
Syllabus

															In the Treaty of 25 October, 1805, with the Cherokees, the
reservation of three miles square for a garrison lies below and not
above the mouth of the Highwassee, where the United States has
placed the garrison.

															Error to the Circuit Court for the District of East Tennessee in
an action of ejectment brought by M'Clung's lessee against Meigs
and others.

															On the trial in the court below, a bill of exceptions was taken
which stated the case as follows:

															The plaintiff's lessor claims the land under a grant from the
State of North Carolina to John Donelson dated 11 July, 1788, for
1,500 acres lying on the north side of Tennessee River, opposite to
a high bluff of rocks of diverse colors. The defendants resided on
the land as officers, and under the authority of the United States,
which had a garrison there and had erected works at an expense of
$30,000. The place where the defendants resided was two miles at
least above the termination of the treaty line opposite the mouth
of the Highwassee. In 1805, the line between the United States and
the Cherokee Indians was run, according to the treaty, under the
direction of the defendant, Meigs, who was an agent of the United
States for that purpose; and afterwards the garrison reserve of
three square miles was laid off by the direction of the defendant
Meigs opposite and above the mouth of the Highwassee River, making
the treaty line from the three forks of Duck River to the point on
Tennessee River opposite the mouth of Highwassee the lower line of
said reservation and the Tennessee River the southern line,
meandering the river and reducing it to a straight line of three
miles in length.

															The defendant's read a copy of a letter written by D. Smith and
the defendant Meigs, who were commissioners on the part of the
United States at the treaty holden with the Cherokee Indians on 25
October, 1805, dated at Washington, January 10, 1806, and addressed
to the Secretary of War, in which they say

															"By the treaty with the Indians concluded at Tellico on 25
October, 1805, there was reserved three square miles of land for
the particular disposal of the United States on the north bank of
the Tennessee, opposite to and below the mouth of Highwassee. This
reservation is ostensibly predicated on the supposition that the
garrison at southwest point, and the United States factory now at
Tellico, would be placed on the reserve during the pleasure of the
United States. But it was stipulated with Doublehead that whenever
the United States should find this land unnecessary for the
purposes mentioned, then it is to revert to Doublehead, provided,
as a condition, that he retain one of the square miles to his own
use

															Page 13 U. S. 13

															and that he is to relinquish his right and claim to the other
two sections of one mile square each in favor of John D. Chisholm
and John Riley, son to Samuel Riley, one of the interpreters in the
Cherokee nation in equal shares."

															"As it is proper that this be recognized, we have made this
statement for your information,"

															"And have the honor to be, &c."

															"DANIEL SMITH"

															"RETURN J. MEIGS"

															When the defendant and the other officers of the United States
went to look for the place to erect the garrison in pursuance of
the reserve, they went first below the mouth of Highwassee, But it
was a low and marshy country, affording no good site for a garrison
and no water or spring was to be had there.

															The plaintiff's counsel insisted that the Indian title to the
land was extinguished and that he had a right to recover, and
prayed the court so to instruct the jury, to which the defendant's
counsel objected and insisted that the defendants were entitled to
recover against the plaintiff, because the Indian title was not
extinguished and because the land was occupied by the United
States' troops, and the defendants as officers of the United
States, for the benefit of the United States, and by their
direction, and because the garrison was erected on the land really
reserved for that purpose by the treaty, as they insisted it was
out of the land ceded that the reserve was made. That it must, by
the letter of the treaty, be understood to be land reserved to the
Indians, out of the part ceded, and not a reserve in favor of the
United States out of the land not ceded by the Indians, and that
the term "reserve" in the treaty controlled the other expressions
"opposite and below the mouth of Highwassee." That the United
States had a right by the Constitution to appropriate the property
of individual citizens, and that the line run, was the true line of
the reservation.

															But the court overruled the objections of the defendant's
counsel and charged the jury that the land reserved

															Page 13 U. S. 14

															for a garrison was opposite to and below the mouth of the
Highwassee, and that the land opposite to and above was ceded to
the United States by the Indians by the treaty of Tellico, and that
the United States had no right to appropriate the land mentioned in
the plaintiff's declaration. And that the plaintiff was authorized
by law to recover if the land covered by his grant lay opposite to
and above the mouth of the Highwassee. That if the treaty had
expressly reserved the three miles square for the disposal of the
United States opposite and above the mouth of Highwassee, the
Indian title would be thereby extinguished, as that reserve would
be north of the treaty line. That if the land thus reserved was at
the time vacant land the United States could appropriate it as it
pleased, but if it was private property, the United States could
not deprive the individual of it without making him just
compensation therefor. And further that by the expressions used in
the said treaty, the Indian title to all land north of the treaty
line, from the point opposite the mouth of Highwassee to Fort Nash,
except such tracts as were expressly reserved for the Indians, was
extinguished, and that the three square miles reserved for the
United States must, according to the treaty, be situate opposite
and below the mouth of Highwassee. To this opinion the counsel for
the defendants excepted.

															By the 2d art. of the Treaty of 25 October 1805, Laws of United
States, vol. 8, 192,

															"The Cherokee's quitclaim and cede to the United States all the
land which they have heretofore claimed lying to the north of the
following boundary line: beginning at the mouth of Duck River,
running thence up the main stream of the same to the junction of
the fork, at the head of which Fort Nash stood, with the main south
fork; thence a direct course to a point on the Tennessee River bank
opposite the mouth of Highwassee River. . . ."

															After describing the other lines of the cession, the treaty
proceeds thus:

															"And whereas, from the present cession made by the Cherokees and
other circumstances, the site of the garrisons at southwest point
and Tellico are become not the most convenient and suitable places
for the accommodation of the Indians, it may become

															Page 13 U. S. 15

															expedient to remove the said garrisons and factory to some more
suitable place, three other square miles are reserved for the
particular disposal of the United States on the north bank of the
Tennessee, opposite to and below the mouth of the Highwassee. "

															Page 13 U. S. 16

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court as
follows:

															The land for which this ejectment was brought lies within the
territory ceded to the United States by the State of North
Carolina, and was claimed by a patent anterior to that cession. At
the date of the grant, the Indian title had not been extinguished.
On 25 October, 1805, a treaty was made between the United States
and the Cherokee Indians in which the Indians ceded to the United
States

															"all the land lying to the north of the following boundary line:
beginning at the mouth of Duck River, running thence up the main
stream of the same to the junction of the fork, at the head of
which Fort Nash stood, with the main south fork; thence a direct
course to a point on the Tennessee River bank opposite the mouth of
the Highwassee River. "

															Page 13 U. S. 17

															The question on which the cause has been placed is this: is the
land claimed by the plaintiff in the court below within the ceded
territory?

															The line mentioned in the treaty has been run, and the land in
controversy lies on the north side of it, and consequently within
the limits ceded to the United States; but there was a further
stipulation in the treaty, which the plaintiffs in error say
comprehends the lands for which this suit is brought.

															After describing the ceded territory, the treaty proceeds to
say:

															"And whereas from the present cession made by the Cherokees, and
other circumstances, the sites of the garrisons at southwest point
and Tellico are become not the most convenient and suitable places
for the accommodation of the said Indians, it may become expedient
to remove the said garrisons and factory to some more suitable
place,"

															three other square miles are reserved for the particular
disposal of the United States on the north bank of the Tennessee
opposite to and below the mouth of Highwassee.

															The ceded territory lies above the mouth of Highwassee, as does
the land in controversy; yet the plaintiffs in error contend that
this land is within the stipulation for a reserve of three square
miles to lie below the mouth of Highwassee.

															They attempt to sustain this proposition by alleging that the
word "below" was inserted in the treaty by mistake, when the word
"above" was intended.

															This mistake ought certainly to be very clearly demonstrated
before the courts of the United States can found upon its existence
a judgment which shall deprive a citizen of his property.

															The argument, so far as it is drawn from the treaty itself,
rests on the word "reserved." It is said that the lands "reserved
for the particular disposal of the United States" must necessarily
be a part of the ceded territory or the term would not aptly
express the idea of the parties.

															Page 13 U. S. 18

															The Court cannot accede to this reasoning. The treaty is the
contract of both parties, each having lands. The words are the
words of both parties, and the term might, without any strained
construction, be applied to the lands of either. No great violence
is done to the known import of the term as used in the treaty if it
be considered as equivalent to the words "set apart." This
construction is rendered necessary by the word "other." "Three
other square miles" -- that is, other than those before ceded --
are reserved for the particular disposal of the United States. The
context, instead of proving that the word, "below" was used by
mistake in the treaty, would rather induce the Court to put that
construction on an ambiguous term, had one been employed.

															The counsel for the plaintiffs in error also rely on a letter
written by the commissioners who negotiated the treaty to the
Secretary of War on 10 January, 1806. But without inquiring into
the weight to which such a letter is entitled in such a case, it is
to be observed that the letter agrees with the terms of the treaty.
It says that the three square miles reserved for the particular
disposal of the United States were "opposite to and below the mouth
of the Highwassee." It is unnecessary to make a further comment on
this letter than to say that there is no expression in it which
appears to the Court to countenance in the slightest degree the
idea that the word "below" in the treaty was used by mistake
instead of the word "above."

															The facts that the agents of the United States took possession
of this land lying above the mouth of the Highwassee, erected
expensive buildings thereon, and placed a garrison there cannot be
admitted to give an explanation to the treaty, which would
contradict its plain words and obvious meaning. The land is
certainly the property of the plaintiff below, and the United
States cannot have intended to deprive him of it by violence and
without compensation. This Court is unanimously and clearly of
opinion that the circuit court committed no error in instructing
the jury that the Indian title was extinguished to the land in
controversy and that the plaintiff below might sustain his
action.

															The judgment is affirmed with costs.
