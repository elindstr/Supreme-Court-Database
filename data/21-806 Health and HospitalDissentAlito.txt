															HEALTH AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF MARION
COUNTY, et al., PETITIONERS v. IVANKA TALEVSKI, as
personal representative of the ESTATE OF GORGI TALEVSKI,
DECEASED

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 8, 2023]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
dissenting.

															I agree with the Court’s understanding of
the high bar required to bring an action under 42
U. S. C. §1983 for the violation of a federal
statute, but I disagree with how that standard applies in this
case. In my view, while respondent has established that the Federal
Nursing Home Reform Act (FNHRA) creates individual rights,
petitioners have established that relief for the violation of those
rights under §1983 is foreclosed by the remedial scheme in the
Act.

															I

															The majority and Justice Barrett correctly
identify the plaintiff ’s burden under §1983: a
statute “must unambiguously confer individual federal
rights” to create “rights” within the meaning of
§1983, and “Gonzaga sets forth our established
method for ascertaining unambiguous conferral.” Ante,
at 11, 14 (majority opinion); see ante, at 1–2
(Barrett, J., concurring); Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe,
536 U.S.
273 (2002). In other words, “if Congress wishes to create
new rights enforceable under §1983, it must do so in clear and
unambiguous terms.” Id., at 290. Because the standard
demands “no less and no more than what is required for
Congress to create new rights enforceable under an implied private
right of action,” I also agree that there is no room for
“a multifactor balancing test to pick and choose which
federal requirements may be enforced by §1983 and which may
not.” Id., at 286, 290 (emphasis added) (rejecting the
standard articulated in Blessing v. Freestone,
520 U.S.
329, 340–341 (1997)). None of this is new ground. We have
previously held that Gonzaga “plainly repudiate[s] the
ready implication of a §1983 action that” our earlier
decisions “exemplified.” Armstrong v.
Exceptional Child Center, Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 330, n.
(2015).

															The two FNHRA provisions that respondent invokes
demonstrate what it takes to satisfy this demanding standard.
First, the Act mandates that a “nursing facility must protect
and promote the rights of each resident, including . . .
[t]he right to be free from . . . chemical restraints
imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required
to treat medical symptoms.” 42 U. S. C.
§1396r(c)(1)(A). Second, the Act protects “[t]ransfer
and discharge rights,” precluding a “nursing
facility” from transferring or discharging “each
resident” except in certain circumstances.
§1396r(c)(2)(A) (boldface deleted). Both of these provisions
explicitly use the term “rights” to describe discrete
and concrete duties that a defined party (“nursing
facility”) owes to a particular individual (“each
resident”). When these features are taken together, they
satisfy the standard for determining whether a personal right
exists. See Gonzaga, 536 U. S., at 285–286;
Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S.
275, 288–289 (2001).

															II

															A

															When determining whether individual rights are
enforceable under §1983, I again see much common ground with
the majority and agree entirely with Justice Barrett’s
explanation of the governing standard. That question “boils
down to what Congress intended, as divined from text and
context.” Ante, at 18 (majority opinion). Notably, we
have explicitly held that this standard does not demand anything
close to the level of incompatibility required to trigger implied
repeal. See Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S.
113, 120, and n. 2 (2005); see ante, at 2 (opinion
of Barrett, J.). Instead, the question is simply “whether the
rights created by a later statute ‘may be asserted within the
remedial framework’ of the earlier one.”
Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 120, n. 2; see
Great American Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Novotny,
442 U.S.
366, 375–378 (1979). As the majority explains, §1983
does not apply where Congress has created an individual right but
also “simultaneously given good reason (detectable with
ordinary interpretive tools) to conclude that the §1983 remedy
is not available.” Ante, at 17, n. 13; see,
e.g., Armstrong, 575 U. S., at 328 (presumption
of equitable remedies rebutted by administrative remedies and
statutory requirements).

															Finally, I agree that there is no bright-line
rule for when a statute evidences an intent to preclude §1983
relief. See Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 122;
ante, at 19–21 (majority opinion); ante, at
3–4 (opinion of Barrett, J.). Courts should consider a
“wide range of contextual clues, like ‘enforcement
provisions’ ” that government officials can invoke
and “any ‘administrative remedies that the statute
offers.’ ” Ante, at 3 (opinion of Barrett,
J.). Whatever the context, the “more comprehensive the
[enforcement] scheme” in a statute, “the less likely
that it leaves the door open for §1983 suits.”
Ibid. After all, when a statute “ ‘provides
its own comprehensive enforcement scheme, the requirements of that
enforcement procedure may not be bypassed by bringing suit directly
under §1983.’ ” Middlesex County Sewerage
Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S.
1, 20 (1981).

															B

															When all is said and done, my disagreement
with the majority is thus narrowly focused on how this standard
applies to this case. In my view, FNHRA “foreclose[s] a
private cause of action” even though it “admittedly
create[s] substantive private rights.” Alexander, 532
U. S., at 290. The Act creates a reticulated remedial regime
that both balances federal and state enforcement and channels
disputes through that regime. Allowing §1983 suits will upend
this careful balance.

															Consider the remedial provisions that the Act
provides. When federal officials find that a nursing home does not
comply with FNHRA, the Act enumerates certain limited remedies they
can pursue, such as withdrawing federal funding and imposing civil
penalties “in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of
noncompliance.” §1396r(h)(3)(C). FNHRA obligates States
to establish certain remedies for noncompliance (including civil
penalties), but otherwise leaves them free to “specify
criteria, as to when and how each of [the required] remedies is to
be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of
these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such
remedies.” §1396r(h)(2)(A). It also empowers
States to “provide for other . . . remedies”
as they see fit. Ibid. Finally, the Act provides
“[s]pecial rules where [s]tate and [federal officials] do not
agree on [a] finding of noncompliance.” §1396r(h)(6)
(boldface deleted).

															By specifying limited remedies for federal
authorities and tasking States with otherwise determining the
consequences for violations, the Act creates a clear division of
authority that ensures States retain their historical control over
nursing-home regulation. Allowing §1983 suits will upset this
balance by allowing any plaintiff to demand damages regardless of
the remedial regime that States establish pursuant to their
explicit authority under the Act. Moreover, whenever a plaintiff
files suit, the determination about noncompliance will be taken
away from federal and state authorities and given to courts. And
because the remedies offered under §1983 will often dwarf the
relief available under FNHRA’s reticulated balance of
remedies, §1983 will swallow the centralized state and federal
review mechanisms the Act imposes.

															The exclusivity of FNHRA’s enforcement
regime is buttressed by the grievance remedy FNHRA gives to
nursing-home residents. Residents have the “[r]ight to voice
grievances with respect to treatment or care” and “the
right to prompt efforts by the facility to resolve
grievances.” §1396r(c)(1)(A)(vi). States, in turn, are
obligated to “investigate complaints of violations of
requirements by nursing facilities” and to take enforcement
actions to correct those violations. §§1396r(g)(4),
(h)(1); see also 42 CFR §483.10(j) (2021) (obligating States
to provide a “grievance process” that includes a
“written decision” in response to complaints that
provides a full summary of findings, conclusions, and
reasoning).

															This grievance process dovetails neatly with
FNHRA’s centralized enforcement regime because it funnels
private complaints to the same state authorities that the Act tasks
with enforcement. Indeed, respondent in this case wielded
FNHRA’s grievance process to obtain relief for both of the
rights petitioners allegedly violated. See App. to Pet. for Cert.
79a–80a. But because FNHRA’s remedies are more limited
than the direct judicial highway that §1983 offers, it is hard
to see why anyone would use them in the future. See Rancho Palos
Verdes, 544 U. S., at 122–123.

															The only textual evidence the majority can
identify in response to this tailored remedial framework is
FNHRA’s saving clause, which states that the Act’s
remedies “are in addition to those otherwise available under
State or Federal law.” §1396r(h)(8). But this provision
only begs the question whether relief under §1983 is
“otherwise available.” We have recognized as much when
holding that a materially identical saving clause did not authorize
implied remedies under a separate remedial provision. See AMG
Capital Management, LLC v. FTC, 593 U. S. ___,
___–___ (2021) (slip op., at 12–13). And in the
§1983 context, we have similarly held that saving clauses do
“not ‘refer to a suit for redress of a violation of the
statut[e] at issue.’ ” Rancho Palos Verdes,
544 U. S., at 126–127 (alterations omitted); accord,
Sea Clammers, 453 U. S., at 20–21,
n. 31.

															These results are understandable. There is a
considerable difference between preserving existing remedies for
conduct that happens to violate other laws and providing a one-stop
remedy for the precise provisions in a statute. See
Alexander, 532 U. S., at 289–290. The latter
interpretation runs against a century of holdings that a statute
“ ‘cannot be held to destroy
itself ’ ” through a saving clause.
American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office
Telephone, Inc., 524 U.S.
214, 227–228 (1998) (quoting Texas & Pacific R.
Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204
U.S. 426, 446 (1907)). Conversely, concluding that FNHRA
“may be enforced only through the statute’s express
remed[ies]” gives full effect to §1396r(h)(8) because
“the claims available under §1983 prior to the enactment
of the [Act] continue to be available.” Rancho Palos
Verdes, 544 U. S., at 126.

															In short, “[a]llowing a plaintiff to
circumvent [FNHRA’s] administrative remedies would be
inconsistent with Congress’ carefully tailored scheme.”
Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S.
992, 1012 (1984). I would thus hold that the Act precludes
enforcement under §1983 and reverse the judgment below. I
therefore respectfully dissent.
