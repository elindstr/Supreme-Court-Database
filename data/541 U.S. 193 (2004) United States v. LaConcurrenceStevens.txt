SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-107

															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. BILLY JO
LARA

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the eighth circuit

															[April 19, 2004]

															   Justice Stevens, concurring.

															   While I join the Court’s
opinion without reservation, the additional writing by my
colleagues prompts this comment. The inherent sovereignty of the
Indian tribes has a historical basis that merits special mention.
They governed territory on this continent long before Columbus
arrived. In contrast, most of the States were never actually
independent sovereigns, and those that were enjoyed that
independent status for only a few years. Given the fact that
Congress can authorize the States to exercise—as their
own—inherent powers that the Constitution has otherwise
placed off limits, see, e.g., Prudential Ins. Co.
v. Benjamin, 328 U. S. 408,
437–438 (1946), I find nothing exceptional in the conclusion
that it can also relax restrictions on an ancient inherent tribal
power.
