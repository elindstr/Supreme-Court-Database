															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															JOHN C. CARNEY, GOVERNOR OF DELAWARE, PETITIONER v. JAMES R. ADAMS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court  of appeals for the third circuit

															[December 10, 2020]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring.

															I agree that respondent Adams did not demonstrate Article III standing to bring this suit.  Because the constitutional questions in this case will likely be raised again, I write separately to highlight two important considerations that may inform their answers.

															First, there are potentially material differences between two separate rules the Delaware Constitution imposes on its courts: the “major party” requirement and the “bare majority” requirement.  Bare majority requirements preclude any single political party from having more than a bare majority of the seats in a public body.  Such requirements have existed in various forums for roughly 150 years, currently feature in a large number of public bodies, and have been shown to help achieve ideological diversity.  Major party requirements like Delaware’s, by contrast, preclude anyone who is not a member of the two major political parties from serving in a public body.  They are far rarer than their bare majority cousins, and they arguably impose a greater burden on
 
First Amendment associational rights.  These differences may require distinct constitutional analyses.

															Second, that possibility, in turn, raises the question whether Delaware’s major party and bare majority requirements are severable from one another, such that one requirement could remain even if the other were constitutionally unenforceable.  It is worth noting that federal courts are not ideally positioned to address such a sensitive issue of state constitutional law.  They may therefore be well advised to consider certifying such a question to the State’s highest court.  See Leavitt v. Jane L.,

518 U.S. 137, 139 (1996) (per curiam) (“Severability [of a state statute] is of course a matter of state law”); Hooper v. Bernalillo County Assessor,

472 U.S. 612, 624 (1985) (“It is for the New Mexico courts to decide, as a matter of state law, whether the state legislature would have enacted the statute without the invalid portion”); see also Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona,

520 U.S. 43, 77 (1997) (encouraging certification of “novel or unsettled questions of state law” to “hel[p] build a cooperative judicial federalism” (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original)); Elkins v. Moreno,

435 U.S. 647, 662, n. 16 (1978) (certifying a question of state law sua sponte because it was “one in which state governments have the highest interest”).  Certification may be especially warranted in a case such as this, where invalidating a state constitutional provision would affect the structure of one of the State’s three major branches of government.
