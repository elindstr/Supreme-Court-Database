															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															ROSELVA CHAIDEZ, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[February 20, 2013]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in the
judgment.

															In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S.
356 (2010), this Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires
an attorney for a criminal defendant to apprise his client of the
risk of deportation created by a guilty plea. I dissented. The
Sixth Amendment provides that “[i]n all criminal
prosecutions,” an accused enjoys the right “to have the
Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” By its terms, this
right extends “to legal advice directly related to defense
against prosecution of the charged offense,” and
“[t]here is no basis in text or in principle” to expand
the reach of this guarantee to guidance concerning the collateral
consequences of a guilty plea. Id., at ___ (slip op., at
2–3) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Today, the Court finds that
Padilla announced a new rule of constitutional law and that,
under our decision in Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S.
288 (1989), “defendants whose convictions became final
prior to Padilla therefore cannot benefit from its
holding.” Ante, at 15. I continue to believe that
Padilla was wrongly decided and that the Sixth Amendment
does not extend—either prospectively or
retrospectively—to advice concerning the collateral
consequences arising from a guilty plea. I, there- fore, believe
that the Teague analysis is unnecessary and thus concur only
in the judgment.
