ON REHEARING

															Decree heretofore made in these cases reaffirmed after rehearing.

															MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER announced the ruling of the Court.

															An opinion expressing the views of the Court in these cases was announced at the last term, and a decree was entered then.   262 U. S. 262 U.S. 553, 623.  By the Court's leave, given at that term, a petition for rehearing was filed.  The cases had been presented in oral argument three times, but three members of the Court had heard only the last presentation.  This, with the importance of the questions involved and the public character of the litigants, led the Court to grant the rehearing.  It was had two weeks ago.  The cases have been considered again in the light of that presentation, and after this further reflection, the Court perceives no ground for disturbing the
