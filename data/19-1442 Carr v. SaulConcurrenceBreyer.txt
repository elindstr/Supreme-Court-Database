															ANDREW M. SAUL, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY

															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[April 22, 2021]

															

															Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I continue to believe that, “[u]nder ordinary principles of administrative law a reviewing court will not consider arguments that a party failed to raise in timely fashion before an administrative agency.”  Sims v. Apfel,

530 U.S. 103, 114 (2000) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  I also adhere to my prior view that, in the particular context of the Social Security Administration, a claimant “ordinarily must raise all relevant issues before the ALJ” and that the “nonadversarial nature” of the agency’s procedures is generally irrelevant to whether the ordinary rule requiring issue exhaustion ought to apply.  Id., at 117.  Here, however, I agree with the Court that the Appointments Clause challenges at issue fall into the well-established exceptions for constitutional and futile claims.  See ante, at 9–11; see also Sims, 530 U. S., at 115 (Breyer, J., dissenting); Woodford v. Ngo,

548 U.S. 81, 103 (2006) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment); Ross v. Blake,

578 U.S. 632, 649 (2016) (Breyer, J., concurring in part) (recognizing these traditional exceptions).  I therefore join Parts I, II–B–1, and II–B–2 of the Court’s opinion and concur in the Court’s judgment.
