															AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSOCIATIONS, INC. and
USF HOLLAND, INC., PETITIONERS v. MICHIGAN
PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of
michigan

															[June 20, 2005]



															   Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

															
   I would affirm the judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals because “ ‘[t]he negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application,’ Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison, 520 U. S. 564, 610 (1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting), and, consequently, cannot serve as a basis for striking down a state statute.”  Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, 539 U. S. 59, 68 (2003) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
