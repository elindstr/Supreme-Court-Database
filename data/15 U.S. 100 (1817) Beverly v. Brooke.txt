Beverly v. Brooke, 15 U.S. 2 Wheat.
100 100 (1817)
Beverly v. Brooke
5 U.S. 100
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT
COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA
Syllabus

															Where the owner of certain slaves and also part owner of a
vessel, hired the slaves to the master of the vessel to proceed as
mariners on board on a voyage, at the usual wages and without any
special contract of hiring, held that the master, having
acted with good faith, was not responsible for the escape of the
slaves in a foreign port, which was one of the contingent termini
of the voyage, and consequently within the hazards to which the
owner knew his property might be exposed, although it was doubtful
whether the master had strictly pursued his orders in going to such
port.

															This suit was instituted by the plaintiff in the Circuit Court
for the County of Alexandria to recover the value of three slaves
hired by the plaintiff to the defendant for a voyage to some part
of Europe in the brig Sophila, of which the defendant was
master, which slaves escaped from the vessel and were lost to the
owner. The claim was founded on the allegation that the master
pursued a different voyage from that for which the slaves were
hired, and that to this cause was to be ascribed the loss that had
been sustained.

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															The declaration in this cause states that the defendant

															"was master of the brig Sophila, then in the County of
Alexandria, and bound on a voyage from thence to Savannah, in the
State of Georgia, and from Savannah to New York, in the State of
New York, and from thence to such other place or places as he, the
said defendant, might be directed to go to by the owners of the
said brig,"

															of whom the plaintiff was one. That believing and expecting the
defendant would pursue the orders he should receive, as was his
duty, he hired to him, for the voyage, the slaves in the
declaration mentioned.

															It appeared in evidence that these slaves were received on board
the vessel as mariners on the usual wages, and without any special
contract.

															Page 15 U. S. 102

															On 23 May, 1809, after the Sophila had sailed from
Alexandria to Savannah, a letter of instructions was addressed to
the master which contains the following directions:

															"I hope this will find you arrived at Savannah, and ready to
proceed on your voyage to Amsterdam, where you are to proceed with
all dispatch, and when you arrive off the Texel, should you not
have received information either from Messrs. Willinks or from some
source that you can depend upon that you can enter Holland with
safety, you are to proceed to Tonningen, and from thence
communicate with Messrs. Willinks and follow their
instructions. If they say they cannot get you admitted to the
continent, or can do nothing for you, you are then at liberty to
take upon yourself the disposal of the cargo in any way that may be
practicable, and the investment of the proceeds in any German goods
that may answer our market. Should no opportunity offer for a sale
at Tonningen or on the coast of Holland, or Denmark, or in the
Baltic, you must then, as a last resort, proceed to Liverpool,"

															&c.

															On 6 July, 1809, a letter, containing additional instructions,
was written, of which the following is an extract:

															"Nothing decisive has yet occurred whereby to judge of the
ultimate result of the pending negotiations between this country
and the powers of the continent. But hoping, by the time you arrive
in the British channel, all difficulties will be settled between us
and the continent, your owners are still desirous and direct that
you may prosecute your voyage as before directed for

															Page 15 U. S. 103

															Amsterdam. They are, however, desirous that before you attempt
to enter the Texel, you inform yourself whether the port be
blockaded and whether there be any danger of confiscation after
entering. And should you not be able to get satisfactory
information on these heads at sea or going up the British channel,
you will proceed as before directed for Tonningen, and from
thence communicate with Messrs. Willinks, of Amsterdam, and Messrs.
Parish & Co., Hamburgh, and abide by their instructions. Should
it so turn out that you cannot with safety proceed to Amsterdam and
that you can get admittance at Tonningen or Hamburgh, you will
deliver your cargo at either place to Messrs. Parish & Co. as
they may instruct you. . . . If no admittance can be had either
at Amsterdam, Hamburgh, or Tonningen, you are then at liberty to do
the best you can with the cargo, as before directed."

															Under these instructions the Sophila proceeded on her
voyage till visited by one of the squadron which blockaded
Amsterdam. Information was there received showing the danger from
the local government of entering the Texel, and also that Hamburgh
and Bremen were shut, and that Tonningen had been shut and opened
to American vessels several times. The Sophila continued
to ply off and on the mouth of the Texel for four or five days,
with her signals displayed, when the master concluded to run into
the Texel, the blockade of which, it would seem, was not then
intended to exclude neutral commerce. In executing this design he
was met by the schooner Enterprise, an American man

															Page 15 U. S. 104

															of war, beating out abreast the first buoy of the Hacks. The
commander of the schooner sent his boat to the Sophila
with a request that her master would come on board the
Enterprise. The defendant went on board, and continued
there near two hours. On his return, the commander of the
Enterprise sent on board the Sophila a Captain
Swaine, master of an American vessel which had been captured by a
Danish cruiser on a voyage to St. Petersburg and condemned. Captain
Swaine gave to Captain Brooke, the defendant, a written statement
containing all the information he possessed respecting the dangers
of those seas. He stated that his vessel was captured on the 4th
and condemned on the 19th of June. That on the 20th, himself and
his men were turned on shore without assigning to them any cause of
capture or condemnation and without making any provision for them.
His men were compelled to go on board Danish privateers to avoid
starving. He remained himself at Albourg, until 17 July, when he
traveled by land to Amsterdam and passed within four miles of
Tonningen. The information of Captain Swaine showed that the seas
about the mouths of the Eider, the Elbe, and the Weser swarmed with
Danish privateers who respected no flag and brought in every
American vessel they could capture. On the 28th of July he passed
through Hamburgh, and waited on the American consul for a passport,
where he was informed by the chancellor that there were several
American vessels at Tonningen petitioning for liberty to land their
cargoes, which they could

															Page 15 U. S. 105

															not obtain, nor was any attention paid to their petitions. He
received the same information afterwards at Amsterdam. By the
consulate at Hamburgh he was also informed that there had been, a
few days before, some American vessels at Cruxhaven, which had been
ordered by the consul to leave that place immediately. After
receiving this information, the Sophila proceeded to
Liverpool, where the slaves of the plaintiff escaped, and have been
totally lost.

															Upon this testimony the counsel for the plaintiff prayed the
court to instruct the jury that if they believed the evidence, the
plaintiff was entitled to recover of the defendant the value of the
slaves in the declaration mentioned. The court refused to give this
instruction, to which refusal the plaintiff excepted. A verdict was
found for the defendant, and a judgment rendered thereon by the
court, which judgment is now before this Court on writ of
error.

															The plaintiff in error contends that the circuit court ought to
have given the instruction prayed for because, 1st, the defendant
has violated the instructions by which he was bound; 2d, any
violation of those instructions subjects him to every loss
sustained in consequence thereof.

															Captain Brooke is supposed to have violated his orders in not
proceeding to Tonningen, and waiting there for the directions of
Messrs. Willinks.

															In considering the instructions given by the owners of the
Sophila, there are extrinsic circumstances which ought not
to be entirely overlooked. The state of the whole commercial world
was without

															Page 15 U. S. 106

															example. The then emperor of France exercised the most absolute
despotism over nearly the whole continent of Europe, and at his
capricious will destroyed the commerce and seized the property of
neutrals in the ports of those who were compelled to submit to his
influence. Under such circumstances it is reasonable to suppose
that in commercial expeditions planned from so distant a place as
the United States, some confidence is placed in the master of the
voyage, and that much must be left to his discretion. Although this
consideration will not excuse a disobedience of orders, it is
entitled to weight in expounding orders not entirely decisive. The
primary object of the owners was obviously that the
Sophila should go to Amsterdam. Yet this primary object
was to be relinquished if not to be attained with safety, and of
this the master was the judge.

															But the orders are said to direct the master absolutely to
proceed to Tonningen should he decline entering the Texel.

															In the first letter of 23 May, this direction does appear to be
positive, but it also appears to have been given in the expectation
that the voyage from the mouth of the Texel to Tonningen might be
prosecuted without imminent danger, and with the probability of
entering some port on the continent. Of this probability the
Messrs. Willinks were to judge, should it be in the power of
Captain Brooke to consult them.

															The first paragraph of the letter of 6 July repeats the order to
proceed to Tonningen,

															Page 15 U. S. 107

															should it be unsafe to enter the Texel, and there "to
communicate with Messrs. Willinks of Amsterdam, and Messrs. Parish
& Co. of Hamburgh, and to follow their instructions." The
letter then directs the conduct of the master should he be enabled
to get admittance into Tonningen or Hamburgh, and proceeds to say,
"If no admittance can be had, either at Amsterdam, Tonningen, or
Hamburgh, you are then at liberty to do the best you can with the
cargo as before directed."

															It is on this last clause in the letter that the difficulty
arises.

															The plaintiff contends that the master had no right to determine
at the mouth of the Texel the practicability of getting into
Tonningen or Hamburgh, but was bound to proceed for the former
place, and when there to govern himself by the directions of
Messrs. Willinks, or of Messrs. Parish & Co. If this be not the
true construction of the letter, he then contends that the
intelligence received off the mouth of the Texel did not excuse the
master for sailing from that place for Liverpool.

															As the first paragraph of that letter contains an unconditional
order to proceed to Tonningen should it be unsafe to go to
Amsterdam, it is probable that the owners might found their
subsequent orders on the state of things which might be found to
exist when the vessel should arrive at Tonningen and on the
expectation that the voyage would be prosecuted to that place. But
this expectation is not so clearly expressed as to be free from
doubt. The writer does not say "if on arriving at Tonningen

															Page 15 U. S. 108

															no admittance can be had,", &c., but, "If no admittance can
be had," &c. These expressions might well be understood to
apply to the fact, although it should be communicated before
arriving at the place, and to dispense with the necessity of a
useless voyage to Tonningen. There is the more reason for coming to
this conclusion from the consideration that the vessel could not
arrive at a place admittance into which was forbidden. Whether this
be the true construction of the letter or not, the phraseology is
deemed too ambiguous to subject the master to remote damages not
certainly produced by his omitting to proceed to Tonningen if, in
omitting so to do, he acted with good faith and a sincere desire to
obey his orders.

															This brings us to the information under which he acted. That
information was that Hamburgh was shut. That Tonningen had been
occasionally shut and occasionally opened to American vessels. That
at the time the cargoes of those which had been admitted were not
allowed to be sold, and that the voyage to Tonningen would be
attended with very serious hazards, which were probably not
contemplated by his owners when they gave their instructions. If in
such a state of things the master should be thought to have
misconstrued his instructions, and should be deemed responsible for
exercising his own discretion, the action, founded on such
misconstruction, would certainly be a harsh one. The Court will not
decide this question, because its decision is rendered unnecessary
by the view taken of the second point.

															Page 15 U. S. 109

															2d. Admitting that the true construction of his orders required
the master to proceed to Tonningen on finding it unsafe to go to
Amsterdam, is he liable in this action?

															The Court thinks he is not. No special contract is proved, and
the slaves of the plaintiffs were put on board the vessel generally
as seamen. The Court is not satisfied that the danger of their
escaping might not be as great on the continent as in England. But
at any rate, Liverpool was one of the contingent termini of the
voyage, and was consequently within the hazards to which the
plaintiff knew his property might be exposed. The danger of losing
them should the Sophila proceed to Liverpool did not deter him from
placing the slaves on board the vessel nor from directing the
master to go to Liverpool or from giving full discretion respecting
his port in an event which was far from being improbable.

															There is no error, and the judgment is to be affirmed with
costs.

															Judgment affirmed.
