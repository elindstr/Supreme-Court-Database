															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															CUOZZO SPEED TECHNOLOGIES, LLC, PETITIONER v. MICHELLE K. LEE, UNDER SECRETARY OF COM-MERCE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIR-ECTOR, PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[June 20, 2016]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															The Court invokes Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U. S. 837 (1984)
, and United States v. Mead Corp.,

533 U. S. 218 (2001)
, to resolve one of the questions presented in this case.  See ante, at 2, 13–20.  But today’s decision does not rest on Chevron’s fiction that ambiguity in a statutory term is best construed as an implicit delegation of power to an administrative agency to determine the bounds of the law.  In an appropriate case, this Court should reconsider that fiction of Chevron and its progeny. See Michigan v. EPA, 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2) (“Chevron deference raises serious separation-of-powers questions”); see also Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads, 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 4) (“[T]he discretion inherent in executive power does not comprehend the discretion to formulate generally applicable rules of private conduct”); Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn., 575 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 8–9) (“Those who ratified the Constitution knew that legal texts would often contain ambiguities. . . . The judicial power was understood to include the power to resolve these ambiguities over time”); Cass, Is Chevron’s Game Worth the Candle? Burning Interpretation at Both Ends, in Liberty’s Nemesis 57–69 (D. Reuter & J. Yoo eds. 2016).

															The Court avoids those constitutional concerns today because the provision of the America Invents Act at issue contains an express and clear conferral of authority to the Patent Office to promulgate rules governing its own proceedings.  See

35 U. S. C. §316(a)(4); ante, at 13.  And by asking whether the Patent Office’s preferred rule is reasonable, ante, at 17–20, the Court effectively asks whether the rulemaking was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,” in conformity with the Administrative Procedure Act,

5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A).  I therefore join the Court’s opinion in full.
