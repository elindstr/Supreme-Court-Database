															MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The court below decided this cause upon authority of its opinion in Behn, Meyer & Co., Limited v. Thomas W. Miller, 296 F. 1002, which, upon appeal, became No. 343 on our docket.  The decree therein has been reversed for reasons stated in the opinion just announced.  The two causes present the same issues.  Consequently the challenged decree herein also must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with our conclusions.
