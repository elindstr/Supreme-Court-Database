SWARTHOUT V. COOKE
562 U. S. ____ (2011)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES





															GARY SWARTHOUT, WARDEN v. DAMON COOKE

															

MATTHEW CATE, SECRETARY, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION v. ELIJAH CLAY

															on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															No. 10–333. Decided January 24, 2011



															   Justice Ginsburg, concurring.

															
   In Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472 U. S. 445, 455 (1985), this Court held that, to comply with due process, revocation of a prisoner’s good time credits must be supported by “some evidence.”  If California law entitled prisoners to parole upon satisfaction of specified criteria, then Hill would be closely in point.  See In re Rosenkrantz, 29 Cal. 4th 616, 657–658, 59 P. 3d 174, 205 (2002).  The Ninth Circuit, however, has determined that for California’s parole system, as for Nebraska’s, Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U. S. 1 (1979), is the controlling precedent.  Hayward v. Marshall, 603 F. 3d 546, 559–561 (2010) (en banc)).  Given that determination, I agree that today’s summary disposition is in order.
