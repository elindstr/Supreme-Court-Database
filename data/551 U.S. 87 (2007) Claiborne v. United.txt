SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES





															MARIO CLAIBORNE, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[June 4, 2007]



															   Per Curiam.

															
   The Court is advised that the petitioner died in St. Louis, Missouri, on May 30, 2007.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is therefore vacated as moot.  See United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36 (1950).

															

It is so ordered.
