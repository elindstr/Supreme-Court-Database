															Justice Thomas, dissenting.

															I dissent for the reasons stated in our joint
opinion, but I write separately to say a word about the Commerce
Clause. The joint dissent and The Chief Justice cor- rectly apply
our precedents to conclude that the Individual Mandate is beyond
the power granted to Congress un- der the Commerce Clause and the
Necessary and Proper Clause. Under those precedents, Congress may
regulate “economic activity [that] substantially affects
interstate commerce.” United States v. Lopez,
514 U.S.
549, 560 (1995). I adhere to my view that “the very
notion of a ‘substantial effects’ test under the
Commerce Clause is inconsistent with the original understanding of
Congress’ powers and with this Court’s early Commerce
Clause cases.” United States v. Morrison,
529 U.S.
598, 627 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring); see also Lopez,
supra, at 584–602 (Thomas, J., concurring);
Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S.
1, 67–69 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting). As I have
explained, the Court’s continued use of that test “has
encouraged the Federal Government to persist in its view that the
Commerce Clause has virtually no limits.” Morrison,
supra, at 627. The Government’s unprecedented claim in
this suit that it may regulate not only economic activity but also
inactivity that substantially affects interstate commerce is
a case in point.
