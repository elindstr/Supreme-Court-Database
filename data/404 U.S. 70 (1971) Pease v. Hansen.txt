															PER CURIAM.

															The motion of the appellant for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.

															Whether a welfare program is or is not federally funded is irrelevant to the constitutional principles enunciated in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana is reversed.
