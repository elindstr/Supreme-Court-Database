															VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC., PETITIONER v. ANGIE MORIANA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of california, second appellate district

															[June 15, 2022]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full.  The Court faithfully applies precedent to hold that California’s anti-waiver rule for claims under the State’s Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (PAGA) is pre-empted only “insofar as it precludes division of PAGA actions into individual and non-individual claims through an agreement to arbitrate.”  Ante, at 20.  In its analysis of the parties’ contentions, the Court also details several important limitations on the pre-emptive effect of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA).  See ante, at 11–17.  As a whole, the Court’s opinion makes clear that California is not powerless to address its sovereign concern that it cannot adequately enforce its Labor Code without assistance from private attorneys general.

															The Court concludes that the FAA poses no bar to the adjudication of respondent Angie Moriana’s “non-individual” PAGA claims, but that PAGA itself “provides no mechanism to enable a court to adjudicate non-individual PAGA claims once an individual claim has been committed to a separate proceeding.”  Ante, at 21.  Thus, the Court reasons, based on available guidance from California courts, that Moriana lacks “statutory standing” under PAGA to litigate her “non-individual” claims separately in state court.  Ibid.  Of course, if this Court’s understanding of state law is wrong, California courts, in an appropriate case, will have the last word.  Alternatively, if this Court’s understanding is right, the California Legislature is free to modify the scope of statutory standing under PAGA within state and federal constitutional limits.  With this understanding, I join the Court’s opinion.
