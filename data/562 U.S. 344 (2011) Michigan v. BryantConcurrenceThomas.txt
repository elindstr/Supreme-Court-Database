562 U. S. ____ (2011)
MICHIGAN V. BRYANT
562 U. S. ____ (2011)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 09-150

															MICHIGAN, PETITIONER v. RICHARD PERRY
BRYANT

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
michigan

															[February 28, 2011]

															   Justice Thomas, concurring in the
judgment.

															   I agree with the Court
that the admission of Covington’s out-of-court statements did
not violate the Confrontation Clause, but I reach this conclusion
because Covington’s questioning by police lacked sufficient
formality and solemnity for his statements to be considered
“testimonial.” See Crawford v.
Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 68
(2004).

															   In determining whether Covington’s
statements to police implicate the Confrontation Clause, the Court
evaluates the “ ‘primary
purpose’ ” of the interrogation. Ante, at
12. The majority’s analysiswhich relies on, inter
alia, what the police knew when they arrived at the scene, the
specific questions they asked, the particular information Covington
conveyed, the weapon involved, and Covington’s medical
conditionillustrates the uncertainty that this test creates for law
enforcement and the lower courts. Ante, at 25–31. I
have criticized the primary-purpose test as “an exercise in
fiction” that is “disconnected from history” and
“yields no predictable results.” Davis v.
Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 839, 838
(2006) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in
part).

															   Rather than attempting to reconstruct the
“primary purpose” of the participants, I would consider
the extent to which the interrogation resembles those historical
practices that the Confrontation Clause addressed. See,
e.g., id., at 835–836 (describing
“practices that occurred under the English bail and committal
statutes passed during the reign of Queen Mary”). As the
majority notes, Covington interacted with the police under highly
informal circumstances, while he bled from a fatal gunshot wound.
Ante, at 19–20, 31. The police questioning was not
“a formalized dialogue,” did not result in
“formalized testimonial ma-terials” such as a
deposition or affidavit, and bore no “in- dicia of
solemnity.” Davis, supra, at 840, 837
(opinion of Thomas, J.); see also Giles v.
California, 554 U. S. 353,
377–378 (2008) (Thomas, J., concurring). Nor is there any
indication that the statements were offered at trial “in
order to evade confrontation.” Davis,
supra, at 840. This interrogation bears little if any
resemblance to the historical practices that the Confrontation
Clause aimed to eliminate. Covington thus did not “bea[r]
testimony” against Bryant, Crawford, supra,
at 51, and the introduction of his statements at trial did not
implicate the Confrontation Clause. I concur in the judgment.
