															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 17–965

															_________________

															DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, et al., PETITIONERS v. HAWAII, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 26, 2018]

															

															Justice Kennedy, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full.  

															There may be some common ground between the opinions in this case, in that the Court does acknowledge that in some instances, governmental action may be subject to judicial review to determine whether or not it is “inexplicable by anything but animus,” Romer v. Evans,

517 U. S. 620, 632 (1996), which in this case would be animosity to a religion.  Whether judicial proceedings may properly continue in this case, in light of the substantial deference that is and must be accorded to the Executive in the conduct of foreign affairs, and in light of today’s decision, is a matter to be addressed in the first instance on remand.  And even if further proceedings are permitted, it would be necessary to determine that any discovery and other preliminary matters would not themselves intrude on the foreign affairs power of the Executive.

															In all events, it is appropriate to make this further observation.  There are numerous instances in which the statements and actions of Government officials are not subject to judicial scrutiny or intervention.  That does not mean those officials are free to disregard the Constitution and the rights it proclaims and protects.  The oath that all officials take to adhere to the Constitution is not confined to those spheres in which the Judiciary can correct or even comment upon what those officials say or do.  Indeed, the very fact that an official may have broad discretion, discretion free from judicial scrutiny, makes it all the more imperative for him or her to adhere to the Constitution and to its meaning and its promise.

															The
 
First Amendment prohibits the establishment of religion and promises the free exercise of religion.  From these safeguards, and from the guarantee of freedom of speech, it follows there is freedom of belief and expression.  It is an urgent necessity that officials adhere to these constitutional guarantees and mandates in all their actions, even in the sphere of foreign affairs.  An anxious world must know that our Government remains committed always to the liberties the Constitution seeks to preserve and protect, so that freedom extends outward, and lasts.
