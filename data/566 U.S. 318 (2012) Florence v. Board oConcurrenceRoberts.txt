															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 10–945

															_________________

															ALBERT W. FLORENCE, PETITIONER v. BOARD
OF CHOSEN FREEHOLDERS OF THE COUNTY OF BURLINGTON et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the third circuit

															[April 2, 2012]

															Chief Justice Roberts, concurring.

															I join the opinion of the Court. As with Justice
Alito, however, it is important for me that the Court does not
foreclose the possibility of an exception to the rule it announces.
Justice Kennedy explains that the circumstances before it do not
afford an opportunity to consider that possibility. Ante, at
18–19. Those circumstances include the facts that Florence
was detained not for a minor traffic offense but instead pursuant
to a warrant for his arrest, and that there was apparently no
alternative, if Florence were to be detained, to holding him in the
general jail population.

															Factual nuances have not played a significant
role as this case has been presented to the Court. Both courts
below regarded acknowledged factual disputes as
“immaterial” to their conflicting dispositions, 621
F.3d 296, 300 (CA3 2010), and before this Court Florence challenged
suspicionless strip searches “no matter what the
circumstances.” Pet. for Cert. i.

															The Court makes a persuasive case for the
general applicability of the rule it announces. The Court is
nonetheless wise to leave open the possibility of exceptions, to
ensure that we “not embarrass the future.” Northwest
Airlines, Inc. v. Minnesota, 322
U.S. 292, 300 (1944) (Frankfurter, J.).
