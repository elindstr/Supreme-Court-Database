THOMAS, J., CONCURRING
JOHANNS V. LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSN.
544 U. S. ____ (2005)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NOS. 03-1164 AND 03-1165

															MIKE JOHANNS, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE,
et al., PETITIONERS

															03–1164   v.
LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSOCIATION
et al.
NEBRASKA CATTLEMEN, INC., et al.,
PETITIONERS

															03–1165   v.
LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSOCIATION
et al.
on writs of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eighth circuit
[May 23, 2005]
   Justice Thomas,
concurring.

															   I join the Court’s opinion.
I continue to believe that “[a]ny regulation that compels the
funding of advertising must be subjected to the most stringent
First Amendment scrutiny.” United States v.
United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405, 419
(2001) (Thomas, J., concurring); see also Glickman v.
Wileman Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521 U. S. 457,
504–506 (1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting). At the same time, I
recognize that this principle must be qualified where the
regulation compels the funding of speech that is the
government’s own. It cannot be that all taxpayers have a
First Amendment objection to taxpayer-funded government speech,
even if the funded speech is not “germane” to some
broader regulatory program. See ante, at 7–8. Like
the Court, I see no analytical distinction between
“pure” government speech funded from general tax
revenues and from speech funded from targeted exactions,
ante, at 10–12; the practice of using targeted taxes
to fund government operations, such as excise taxes, dates from the
founding, see The Federalist No. 12, p. 75 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).

															   Still, if the advertisements associated their
generic pro-beef message with either the individual or organization
respondents, then respondents would have a valid as-applied First
Amendment challenge. The government may not, consistent with the
First Amendment, associate individuals or organizations
involuntarily with speech by attributing an unwanted message to
them, whether or not those individuals fund the speech, and whether
or not the message is under the government’s control. This
principle follows not only from our cases establishing that the
government may not compel individuals to convey messages with which
they disagree, see, e.g., West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v.
Barnette, 319 U. S. 624,
633–634 (1943); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705,
713–717 (1977), but also from our expressive-association
cases, which prohibit the government from coercively associating
individuals or groups with unwanted messages, see, e.g.,
Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 653
(2000) (government cannot “force [an] organization to send a
message” with which it disagrees); Hurley v.
Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston,
Inc., 515 U. S.
557, 576–577 (1995). If West Virginia had compelled Mr.
Barnette to take out an advertisement reciting the Pledge of
Allegiance and purporting to be “A Message from the Barnette
Children,” for example, that would have been compelled speech
(if a less intrusive form of it), just like the mandatory flag
salute invalidated in Barnette. The present record,
however, does not show that the advertisements objectively
associate their message with any individual respondent.
Ante, at 13–15, and n. 11.* The targeted nature of
the funding is also too attenuated a link.

															   Moreover, these are not cases like
Barnette; the government has not forced respondents to
bear a government-imposed message. Cf. ante, at 13,
n. 8; post, at 10, n. 9 (Souter, J.,
dissenting). The payment of taxes to the government for purposes of
supporting government speech is not nearly as intrusive as being
forced to “utter what is not in [one’s] mind,”
Barnette, supra, at 634, or to carry an unwanted
message on one’s property.

															   With these observations, I join the
Court’s opinion.

															* I note that on remand respondents may be
able to amend their complaint to assert an attribution claim. See
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15.
