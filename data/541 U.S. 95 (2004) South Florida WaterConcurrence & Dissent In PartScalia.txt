SOUTH FLA. WATER MANAGEMENT DIST. V.MICCOSUKEE TRIBE
541 U. S. ____ (2004)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 02-626

															SOUTH FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT, PETITIONER
v. MICCOSUKEE TRIBE OF INDIANS et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the eleventh circuit

															[March 23, 2004]

															   Justice Scalia, concurring in
part and dissenting in part.

															   I join Parts I and II–A of
the Court’s opinion, which hold that a point source is not
exempt from the NPDES permit requirement merely because it does not
itself add pollutants to the water it pumps. I dissent, however,
from its decision to vacate the judgment below on another ground,
Part II–C, ante, and to invite consideration of yet
another legal theory, Part II–B, ante. Neither of
those actions is taken in response to the question presented. I
would affirm the Court of Appeals’ disposition of the
question presented without reaching other issues.

															   Parts II–B and II–C are
problematic for other reasons as well. In Part II–B, the
Court declines to resolve the Government’s unitary-waters
argument on the ground that it was not raised or decided below. See
ante, at 11. In my judgment, a fair reading of the opinion
and briefs does not support that contention. See, e.g.,
280 F. 3d 1364, 1368, n. 5 (CA11 2002) (“We reject
the Water District’s argument that no addition of pollutants
can occur unless pollutants are added from the outside world
insofar as the Water District contends the outside world cannot
include another body of navigable waters” (emphasis
added)); Brief for Appellant in No. 00–15703–CC (CA11),
p. 10 (“The S–9 pump station merely moves navigable
waters from one side of the Levee to another”). That the
argument was not phrased in the same terms or argued with the same
clarity does not mean it was not made. I see no point in directing
the Court of Appeals to consider an argument it has already
rejected.

															   I also question the Court’s holding in
Part II–C that summary judgment was precluded by the
possibility that, if the pumping station were shut down, flooding
in the C– 11 basin might ultimately cause pollutants to flow
from C–11 to WCA–3. Ante, at 13–14. To
my knowledge, that argument has not previously been made.
Petitioner argued that WCA–3 and C–11 were historically
part of the same ecosystem and that they remain hydrologically
related, see Brief for Petitioner 46–49, but that is quite
different from arguing that, absent S–9, pollutants would
flow from C–11 to WCA–3 (a journey that, at the moment,
is uphill). Nothing in Celotex Corp. v.
Catrett, 477 U. S. 317 (1986),
requires a district court to speculate sU. S.onte about
possibilities even the parties have not contemplated. Cf. Fed. Rule
Civ. Proc. 56(e) (opponent of summary judgment must “set
forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for
trial”).

															   I would affirm the judgment below as to the
question presented, leaving the Government’s unitary-waters
theory to be considered in another case.
