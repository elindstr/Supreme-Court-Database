															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 11–1231

															_________________

															KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND
HUMAN SERVICES, PETITIONER v. AU- BURN REGIONAL MEDICAL
CENTER et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

															[January 22, 2013]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring.

															The Court holds that the presumption in favor of
equitable tolling that we adopted in Irwin v. Department
of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S.
89, 95–96 (1990), does not apply to 42 U. S. C.
§1395oo(a)(3)’s nonjurisdictional 180-day
deadline for health care providers to file administrative appeals
with the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB), and that the
Secretary’s regulation limiting “good cause”
extensions of that deadline to three years is a permissible
interpretation of the statute. I agree with those holdings and join
the Court’s opinion in full. I write separately to note that
the Court’s decision in this case does not establish that
equitable tolling principles are irrelevant to internal
administrative deadlines in all, or even most, contexts.

															The Court is correct that our equitable tolling
cases have typically involved deadlines to bring suit in federal
court. Ante, at 12. But we have never suggested that the
presumption in favor of equitable tolling is generally inapplicable
to administrative deadlines. Cf. Henderson v.
Shinseki, 562 U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2011) (slip op., at
12, n. 4) (noting that the Government did not dispute whether
the statutory filing deadline in the Article I Veterans Court was
subject to equitable tolling if the deadline was
nonjurisdictional); United States v. Brockamp,
519 U.S.
347, 350–353 (1997) (assuming without deciding that the
Irwin presumption applied to administrative tax refund
claims but finding based on statutory text, structure, and the
underlying subject matter that tolling was unavail- able); see also
ante, at 12 (discussing Brockamp). And we have
previously applied the Irwin presumption outside the context
of filing deadlines in Article III courts. See Young v.
United States, 535 U.S.
43, 49–53 (2002) (applying the presumption to a
limitations period in bankruptcy proceedings); cf. Zipes v.
Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S.
385, 392–398 (1982) (holding that the statutory time
limit for filing charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission was “not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in
federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of
limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable
tolling”).

															In administrative settings other than the one
presented here, I believe the “background principle”
that limita- tions periods “are customarily subject to
equitable tolling,” Young, 535 U. S., at
49–50 (internal quotation marks omitted), may limit an
agency’s discretion to make filing deadlines absolute. The
Court quite properly observes that the question whether equitable
tolling is available turns on congressional intent. See
ante, at 13. “[A] realistic assessment” of that
intent, Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95, may vary by
context.

															In this case, given the nature of the statutory
scheme, which “applies to ‘sophisticated’
institutional providers” who are “repeat players”
in the Medicare system, and the statute’s history, I agree
that it would distort congres- sional intent to presume that the
PRRB’s administrative deadline should be subject to equitable
tolling. Ante, at 12–14 (quoting Your Home Visiting
Nurse Services, Inc. v. Shalala, 525
U.S. 449, 456 (1999)). By contrast, with respect to remedial
statutes designed to protect the rights of unsophisticated
claimants, see ante, at 13, agencies (and reviewing courts)
may best honor congressional intent by presuming that statutory
deadlines for admin- istrative appeals are subject to equitable
tolling, just as courts presume comparable judicial deadlines under
such statutes may be tolled. Because claimants must generally
pursue administrative relief before seeking judicial review,
see Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S.
81, 88–91 (2006), a contrary approach could have odd
practical consequences and would attribute a strange intent to
Congress: to protect a claimant’s ability to seek judicial
review of an agency’s decision by making equitable tolling
available, while leaving to the agency’s discretion whether
the same claimant may invoke equitable tolling in order to seek an
administrative remedy in the first place.

															Even in cases where the governing statute
clearly delegates to an agency the discretion to adopt rules that
limit the scope of equitable exceptions to administrative
deadlines, I believe “cases may arise where the equities in
favor of tolling the limitations period are ‘so great that
deference to the agency’s judgment is
inappropriate.’ ” Bowen v. City of New
York, 476 U.S.
467, 480 (1986) (quoting Mathews v. Eldridge,
424 U.S.
319, 330 (1976)). In particular, efforts by an agency to
enforce tight filing deadlines in cases where there are credible
allegations that filing delay was due to the agency’s own
misfea- sance may not survive deferential review. While equitable
tolling extends to circumstances outside both parties’
control, the related doctrines of equitable estoppel and fraudulent
concealment may bar a defendant from enforcing a statute of
limitation when its own deception prevented a reasonably diligent
plaintiff from bringing a timely claim. See United States v.
Beggerly, 524 U.S.
38, 49–50 (1998) (Stevens, J., concurring) (noting that
these doctrines are distinct); see generally 2 C. Corman,
Limitation of Actions §§9.1, 9.7 (1991) (describing the
doctrines). In Bowen, we applied the basic principle
underlying these doctrines to an agency’s conduct, as we
concluded that a 60-day deadline to seek judicial review of the
administrative denial of disability benefits should be tolled
because the Social Security Administration’s
“ ‘secretive conduct pre- vent[ed] plaintiffs from
knowing of a violation of rights.’ ” 476
U. S., at 481 (quoting New York v. Heckler, 742
F.2d 729, 738 (CA2 1984)).

															While the providers in this case allege that the
agency’s failure to disclose information about how it
calculated the Supplemental Security Income fraction prevented them
from bringing timely challenges to reimbursement de- terminations,
I am satisfied that the Secretary’s 3-year good-cause
exception is a reasonable accommodation of the competing interests
in administrative efficiency and fairness. We would face a
different case if the Secretary’s regulation did not
recognize an exception for good cause or defined good cause so
narrowly as to exclude cases of fraudulent concealment and
equitable estoppel. See ante, at 3, n. 2
(explaining that the Secretary’s amended regulation limiting
the scope of “ ‘good cause,’ ” 73
Fed. Reg. 30250 (2008) (codified in 42 CFR §405.1836(b)
(2012)), is not before us).

															With these observations, I join the
Court’s opinion in full.
