Boston Mining Company v. Eagle Mining Company
Submitted October 22, 1885
Decided October 2, 1885
115 U.S. 221

IN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED

															STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA
Syllabus

															There being no assignment of error or appearance for plaintiff in error, judgment below is affirmed on motion of defendant in error, without examining the record.

															The facts which make the case are stated in the opinion of the Court.

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.

															When this cause was reached on the call of the docket, it was submitted by the defendant in error on a printed brief.  An assignment of errors was not annexed to or returned with the writ of error, as required by ยง 997, Rev.Stat.  At the last term, the counsel for the plaintiff in error was permitted to withdraw his appearance, and no one has taken his place.  No argument has been submitted in behalf of the plaintiff in error, and no errors have been assigned in any form.  We therefore affirm the judgment without opening the record.

															Affirmed.
