															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															BILLY RAYMOND COUNTERMAN, PETITIONER v.
COLORADO

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals
of colorado

															[June 27, 2023]

															

															Justice Barrett, with whom Justice Thomas
joins, dissenting.

															Billy Counterman was convicted under a Colorado
law that prohibits true threats. As everyone agrees, the statute
requires that the speaker understand the meaning of his words.
Ante, at 4, n. 1. The question is what more the First
Amendment requires. Colorado maintains that an objective
standard is enough—that is, the government must show that a
reasonable person would regard the statement as a threat of
violence. Counterman, however, argues that the First Amendment
requires a subjective test—that is, the speaker
himself must intend or know the threatening nature of the
statement.

															It should be easy to choose between these
positions. True threats do not enjoy First Amendment protection,
and nearly every other category of unprotected speech may be
restricted using an objective standard. Nonetheless, the Court
adopts a subjective standard, though not quite the one advanced by
Counterman. The Court holds that speakers must recklessly disregard
the threatening nature of their speech to lose constitutional
protection. Because this unjustifiably grants true threats
preferential treatment, I respectfully dissent.

															I

															Since the founding, the First Amendment has
allowed the government to regulate certain “areas of
speech” “because of their constitutionally proscribable
content.” R. A. V. v. St. Paul,
505 U.S.
377, 382–383 (1992) (emphasis deleted). This includes
true threats, which are “serious expression[s] of an intent
to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or
group of individuals.” Virginia v. Black,
538 U.S.
343, 359 (2003); see also R. A. V., 505
U. S., at 388 (“[T]hreats of violence are outside the
First Amendment”). True threats carry little value and impose
great cost. See Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
315 U.S.
568, 572 (1942) (“[A]ny benefit that may be derived from
[true threats] is clearly outweighed by the social interest in
order and morality”). “[B]y their very
utterance,” true threats “inflict injury.”
Ibid. They provoke “the fear of violence,”
create “disruption,” give rise to “the
possibility that the threatened violence will
occur”—and the list goes on. Black, 538 U. S.,
at 360 (internal quotation marks omitted).[1]

															The nature of a true threat points to an
objective test for determining the scope of First Amendment
protection: Neither its “social value” nor its
potential for “injury” depends on the speaker’s
subjective intent. Chaplinsky, 315 U. S., at 572. They
can relate, of course—a speaker who does not intend to
threaten is less likely to utter a statement that could be taken
that way. But the Constitution ultimately declines to protect true
threats for objective reasons, not subjective ones. So an objective
test “complements the explanation for excluding threats of
violence from First Amendment protection in the first place.”
United States v. Jeffries, 692 F.3d 473, 480 (CA6
2012).

															II

															The Court agrees that “[t]he existence
of a threat depends not on ‘the mental state of the
author,’ but on ‘what the statement conveys’ to
the person on the other end.” Ante, at 6. And it
acknowledges that “[w]hen the statement is understood as a
true threat, all the harms that have long made threats unprotected
naturally follow.” Ibid. Nonetheless, the Court holds
Colorado’s statute unconstitutional. Why? Because the Court
installs a prophylactic buffer zone to avoid chilling protected
speech—a buffer zone that protects true threats unless the
speaker “consciously disregarded a substantial risk that his
communications would be viewed as threatening violence.”
Ante, at 1, 4–5. That reasoning is flawed.

															A

															The Court’s first error is awarding true
threats “pride of place among unprotected speech.”
Elonis v. United States, 575 U.S. 723, 767 (2015)
(Thomas, J., dissenting). We have held that nearly every category
of unprotected speech may be regulated using an objective test. In
concluding otherwise, the Court neglects certain cases and misreads
others.

															Start with fighting words—a category of
unprotected speech that the Court skips past. Fighting words are
“personally abusive epithets” that are
“inherently likely to provoke violent reaction.”
Cohen v. California, 403 U.S.
15, 20 (1971). Under our precedent, legislatures may regulate
fighting words even when the speaker does not intend to provoke the
listener (or does not recklessly disregard that possibility).
Chaplinsky, 315 U. S., at 572–573 (rejecting
First Amendment challenge to a state law punishing “fighting
words” according to a reasonable-person standard);
Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310
U.S. 296, 309–310 (1940) (statements unprotected when
they are “likely to provoke violence and disturbance of good
order, even though no such eventuality be intended”).
Instead, we ask only whether “the ordinary citizen,”
using her “common knowledge,” would reasonably
understand the statement as a “direct personal insult.”
Cohen, 403 U. S., at 20; see also Texas v.
Johnson, 491 U.S.
397, 409 (1989).

															The Court similarly overlooks the category of
“false, deceptive, or misleading” commercial speech.
Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme
Court of Ohio, 471 U.S.
626, 638 (1985); In re R. M. J., 455 U.S.
191, 203 (1982) (“Truthful advertising . . . is
entitled to the protections of the First Amendment,” but
“[m]isleading advertising may be prohibited entirely”);
Ibanez v. Florida Dept. of Business and Professional
Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, 512
U.S. 136, 142 (1994) (“[F]alse, deceptive, or misleading
commercial speech may be banned”). Here, too, our cases
suggest that First Amendment protection depends on objective
falsity rather than the speaker’s intention. See In re
R. M. J., 455 U. S., at 202
(“[R]egulation—and imposition of discipline—are
permissible where the particular advertising is inherently
likely to deceive or where the record indicates that a
particular form or method of advertising has in fact been
deceptive” (emphasis added)); see also Milavetz,
Gallop & Milavetz, P. A. v. United
States, 559 U.S.
229, 250–253 (2010). Thus, the government is “free
to prevent the dissemination of commercial speech that is false,
deceptive, or misleading,” without regard to whether the
speaker knew that the recipient would be deceived or misled.
Zauderer, 471 U. S., at 638.

															Or take obscenity, which we have long held is
“not protected by the freedoms of speech and press.”
Roth v. United States, 354 U.S.
476, 481 (1957). Speech qualifies as obscene if the
“ ‘average person, applying contemporary community
standards,’ ” would conclude that “the work,
taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest.”
Miller v. California, 413 U.S.
15, 24 (1973). The jury must also make an objective judgment
about whether the speech “depicts or describes” sexual
conduct “in a patently offensive way,” and whether it
“lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value.” Ibid. The speaker’s
“ ‘belief as to the obscenity or non-obscenity of
the material is irrelevant.’ ” Hamling v.
United States, 418 U.S.
87, 120–121 (1974). So long as the defendant has
“knowledge of the contents of the materials,” her
speech may be constitutionally regulated. Id., at 123. An
objective, reasonable-person standard applies.

															In an effort to bolster its position, the Court
floats a different standard for obscenity laws, asserting that
“the First Amendment demands proof of a defendant’s
mindset to make out an obscenity case.” Ante, at 8. By
“mindset,” the Court apparently means that the
defendant must have some awareness that an average person would
consider the materials obscene. But the Court draws this conclusion
from cases rejecting a strict liability standard—for
example, we have held that the proprietor of a bookstore cannot be
liable for possessing an obscene book unless he knew what was in
it. Smith v. California, 361
U.S. 147, 149, 155 (1959); Mishkin v. New York,
383 U.S.
502, 510–512 (1966); see also Ginsberg v. New
York, 390 U.S.
629, 643–644 (1968).[2] Knowing what the material depicts is not the same as
knowing how the average person would react to it—just as
there is an important difference between Counterman’s
knowledge of what his words meant and his knowledge of how they
would be perceived. Though the Court conflates the two, our
obscenity cases have repeatedly refused to require the latter as a
matter of constitutional law. Hamling, 418 U. S., at
120–123; Rosen v. United States, 161 U.S.
29, 41–42 (1896). So obscenity doctrine does not help
Counterman.

															The Court leans hardest on defamation law, but
its argument depends on a single, cherry-picked strand of the
doctrine. Yes, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan
requires public figures and public officials to show “actual
malice” on a defamation claim, and we have defined
“actual malice” as “knowledge that [the
statement] was false” or “reckless disregard of whether
it was false or not.” 376 U.S.
254, 279–280 (1964). But that is not the full story. A
private person need only satisfy an objective standard to recover
actual damages for defamation. Gertz v. Robert Welch,
Inc., 418 U.S.
323, 347–350 (1974). And if the defamatory speech does
not involve a matter of public concern, she may recover punitive
damages with the same showing. Dun & Bradstreet,
Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S.
749, 760–761 (1985) (plurality opinion). We have
justified that distinction on the ground that public-figure
defamation claims may deter “would-be critics of official
conduct . . . from voicing their criticism,” which
would “dampe[n] the vigor and limit the variety of public
debate.” Sullivan, 376 U. S., at 279. Not only
that, but “the state interest in protecting” public
figures is weaker, since they tend to “enjoy significantly
greater access to the channels of effective communication and hence
have a more realistic opportunity to counteract false
statements.” Gertz, 418 U. S., at 344. So,
despite what the Court says, Sullivan does not stand for the
broad proposition that the First Amendment “demand[s] a
subjective mental-state requirement.” Ante, at 6.
Instead, it simply raises the bar for borderline unprotected speech
with high social value (because of its proximity to public
discourse) and low potential for injury (because public figures can
engage in counterspeech).

															Sullivan’s rationale does not
justify a heightened mens rea for true threats. Because true
threats are not typically proximate to debate on matters of public
concern, the Court’s newly erected buffer zone does not serve
the end of protecting heated political commentary. Nor can public
figures use counterspeech in the public square to protect
themselves from serious threats of physical violence. And
perversely, private individuals now have less protection from true
threats than from defamation—even though they presumably
value their lives more than their reputations. See Gertz,
418 U. S., at 347–350. The Court has therefore extended
Sullivan in a way that makes no sense on
Sullivan’s own terms.

															I will give the Court this much: Speakers must
specifically intend to incite violence before they lose First
Amendment protection. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S.
444, 447 (1969) (per curiam) (defining incitement
as “advocacy . . . directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless action and likely to incite or produce
such action”); see also Hess v. Indiana,
414 U.S.
105, 108–109 (1973) (per curiam). Once more,
however, our precedent itself explains the difference. Incitement,
as a form of “advocacy,” often arises in the political
arena. See Brandenburg, 395 U. S., at 447 (Ku Klux Klan
rally held to plan a “ ‘marc[h] on
Congress’ ”); Hess, 414 U. S., at 106
(antiwar demonstration); Abrams v. United States,
250 U.S.
616, 620 (1919) (pamphlets about the President’s
“ ‘shameful, cowardly silence about the
intervention in Russia’ ”). A specific intent
requirement helps draw the line between incitement and
“political rhetoric lying at the core of the First
Amendment.” NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.,
458 U.S.
886, 926–927 (1982). The Court does not contend that
targeted threats and political commentary share a similarly close
relationship.

															In sum, our First Amendment precedent does not
set a “baseline ban on an objective standard.”
Ante, at 10. Precedent does more than allow an objective
test for true threats; on balance, it affirmatively supports
one.

															B

															The Court’s analysis also gives short
shrift to how an objective test works in practice. Two key features
of true threats already guard against the risk of silencing
protected speech. Thus, there is no need to go further and adopt
the Court’s heightened standard.

															First, only a very narrow class of statements
satisfies the definition of a true threat. To make a true threat,
the speaker must express “an intent to commit an act of
unlawful violence.” Black, 538 U. S., at 359
(emphasis added). Speech that is merely “offensive,”
“ ‘poorly chosen,’ ” or
“unpopular” does not qualify. Brief for Petitioner 31,
36, 42. The statement must also threaten violence “to a
particular individual or group of individuals”—not just
in general. Black, 538 U. S., at 359. These tight
guardrails distinguish true threats from public-figure defamation,
the model for the Court’s rule. While defamatory statements
can cover an infinite number of topics, true threats target one:
unlawful violence.

															Second, the statement must be deemed threatening
by a reasonable listener who is familiar with the “entire
factual context” in which the statement occurs. State
v. Taveras, 342 Conn. 563, 572, 271 A.3d 123, 129 (2022).
This inquiry captures (among other things) the speaker’s
tone, the audience, the medium for the communication, and the
broader exchange in which the statement occurs.[3] Each consideration helps weed out protected
speech from true threats.

															Our decision in Black illustrates the
point. There, the Court considered a Virginia law that prohibited
cross burning “ ‘with the intent of intimidating
any person or group of persons.’ ” 538 U. S.,
at 348. Notably, the statute included a presumption:
“ ‘Any such burning of a cross shall be prima
facie evidence of an intent to intimidate.’ ”
Ibid. After three men were convicted under the statute, they
challenged it as facially unconstitutional. We upheld the general
prohibition on cross burning, concluding that the First Amendment
allows the government to ban “a particular type of
threat.” Id., at 362–363. A plurality then went
on to address the statutory presumption. While cross burning
“may mean that a person is engaging in constitutionally
proscribable intimidation,” the plurality reasoned, the act
is not monolithic. Id., at 365. Cross burning could be
directed “at an individual” or “at a group of
like-minded believers”; it could be done “on a
neighbor’s lawn” or “at a public rally”; it
could be done with the property owner’s
“permission” or without it. Id., at 366.
The presumption “blur[red] the line” between these
different situations and “ignore[d] all of the contextual
factors that are necessary to decide whether a particular cross
burning” was covered by the statute or not.[4] Id., at 365, 367. Thus, the
presumption was unconstitutionally overbroad.

															The Black plurality’s reasoning can
be boiled down to the following insight: When context is ignored,
true threats cannot be reliably distinguished from protected
speech. The reverse also holds: When context is properly
considered, constitutional concerns abate. See, e.g.,
Watts v. United States, 394 U.S.
705, 708 (1969) (per curiam) (concluding that a
statement was “political hyperbole” instead of a true
threat based on “context,” “the expressly
conditional nature of the statement,” and the “reaction
of the listeners”).

															One more point: Many States have long had
statutes like Colorado’s on the books. See Brief for Illinois
et al. as Amici Curiae 16–17. Before we took this
case, the vast majority of Courts of Appeals and state high courts
had upheld these statutes as constitutional. So objective tests are
effectively the status quo today, yet Counterman still struggles to
identify past prosecutions that came close to infringing on
protected speech. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28–30. The silence is
telling.

															C

															So is the silence in the historical record.
Since 1791, true threats have been excluded from the
“speech” protected by the First Amendment.
R. A.V., 505 U. S., at 382–383, 388. If
Counterman could show that a subjective requirement has been
inherent in the definition of “true threat” since the
founding, he would have a compelling case. But Counterman cannot
make that showing.

															For starters, he produces no evidence directly
addressing the meaning of the First Amendment—nothing from
state ratifying conventions, political commentary, or even early
debates about efforts to regulate threats in ways that might
threaten speech. That is not surprising at the federal level,
because the Federal Government did not prohibit threats until the
early 20th century. Elonis, 575 U. S., at 760 (Thomas,
J., dissenting). Some States, however, both regulated threats and
guaranteed the right to free speech in their own constitutions.
Id., at 760–761. Yet even at the state level,
there was apparently no discussion about the implications of these
statutes for the constitutional right.

															That void notwithstanding, the state threat
statutes are the evidence on which Counterman seizes. He argues
that they imposed a subjective mens rea, demonstrating that
the founding generation thought that threats could be punished on
no less. But as Justice Thomas has already discussed in detail,
this is incorrect. See id., at 760–765. Rather than a
subjective mens rea, these statutes used an objective
standard resembling Colorado’s.

															Even if they did require a heightened mens
rea, though, these statutes would not carry the day for
Counterman. The enactment of a statute against the backdrop of a
free speech guarantee tends to show that the legislature thought
the statute consistent with that guarantee. Thus, if the question
were whether such statutes violated the First Amendment,
their existence would be evidence to the contrary. But the question
here is whether a subjective intent requirement is the
constitutional floor. And because the legislature is always free to
exceed the floor, the enactment of legislation does not necessarily
reflect the legislature’s view of the constitutional
minimum.

															At the end of the day, then, the best historical
case for Counterman does not add up to much. He is plainly not
asking the Court to enforce a historically sanctioned rule, but
rather to fashion a new one.

															D

															Even if a subjective test had a historical
pedigree, the Court’s chosen standard of recklessness
certainly does not. Where does recklessness come from? It was not
raised by the parties. Only the Solicitor General noted this
possibility—and briefly at that. Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 28–31. Nor did the courts below address
recklessness; indeed, very few courts (of the many that have taken
up the question) have settled on recklessness as the constitutional
floor for true threats. See, e.g., State v.
Mrozinski, 971 N.W.2d 233, 243–245 (Minn. 2022);
In re J. J. M., 265 A.3d 246, 269–270
(Pa. 2021). Still, the Court adopts recklessness as “the
right path forward.” Ante, at 11. Its rationale is, at
best, unclear.

															The Court begins by acknowledging the
“ ‘competing value[s]’ ” of
“free expression” on one hand, and “profound
harms . . . to both individuals and society” on the
other. Ante, at 11–12. But why do these considerations
point to recklessness? A knowledge or purpose standard would allow
more free expression, so maybe we should go higher. See
ante, at 16 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (“chilling concerns only further
buttress the conclusion that true threats should be limited to
intentionally threatening speech”). An objective standard
would cause less harm to victims, so perhaps lower is better. The
optimal balance strikes me as a question best left to the
legislature, which could calibrate the mens rea to the
circumstance—for example, higher for the criminal context and
lower for the civil. See Brief for Illinois et al. as Amici
Curiae 28–30 (States “have a range of policy
reasons for using subjective standards for penalizing threats of
violence” and many “choose to require proof of a
speaker’s subjective mental state” in some situations
but not others).

															Nor does our First Amendment precedent buttress
the Court’s preferred standard. A recklessness requirement
currently applies only to public-figure defamation claims.
Incitement to violence calls for more. Fighting words,
private-figure defamation, false commercial speech, and obscenity
require less. I fail to see why, of all these categories of
unprotected speech, public-figure defamation is the best analog for
true threats. The reality is that recklessness is not grounded in
law, but in a Goldilocks judgment: Recklessness is not too much,
not too little, but instead “just right.”

															III

															Some may find Colorado’s statute harsh,
and the Court’s decision seems driven in no small part by the
heavy hammer of criminal punishment. See ante, at 12;
ante, at 14–15, 20–21 (opinion of Sotomayor,
J.). While an objective test is “a familiar feature of civil
liability in tort law,” the “ ‘conventional
requirement for criminal conduct’ ” is
“ ‘awareness of some
wrongdoing.’ ” Elonis, 575 U. S., at
737–738. In keeping with this convention, we generally
presume that “federal criminal statutes that are silent on
the required mental state” nonetheless impose the
“mens rea which is necessary to separate wrongful
conduct from otherwise innocent conduct.” Id., at 736
(internal quotation marks omitted). That is why we rejected an
objective standard for the federal threat prohibition, 18
U. S. C. §875(c). 575 U. S., at 737–739.
It is “the threatening nature of the communication”
that “makes the conduct ‘wrongful’ ”;
thus, the statute is best interpreted to require that the defendant
be aware of the impact of his speech. Id., at 737.

															But this case is about the scope of the First
Amendment, not the interpretation of a criminal statute.
Accordingly, the Court’s holding affects the civil
consequences for true threats just as much as it restricts criminal
liability. And the civil context underscores the danger of adopting
a Sullivan-style buffer zone for true threats.

															Consider, for example, threat victims who seek
restraining orders to protect themselves from their harassers. See,
e.g., United States v. Elonis, 841 F.3d 589,
593 (CA3 2016) (defendant’s wife sought a restraining order
after he wrote on Facebook, “I’m not going to rest
until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the
little cuts”). Civil orders can also keep individuals away
from particular geographic areas. Imagine someone who threatens to
bomb an airport, State v. Johnston, 156 Wash. 2d 355,
358–359, 
127 P.3d 707, 708–709 (2006), or “shoot up [a]
courthous[e],” State v. Draskovich, 2017
S. D. 76, ¶3, 904 N.W.2d 759, 761. The speaker might well
end up barred from the location in question—for good reason.
Yet after today, such orders cannot be obtained without
proof—not necessarily easy to secure—that the person
who issued the threat anticipated that it would elicit fear. See
Tr. of Oral Arg. 92–93.

															The government can also opt to counteract true
threats by means of civil enforcement actions. For instance, 18
U. S. C. §248 prohibits “threat[s] of
force” against any person “obtaining or providing
reproductive health services” or “seeking to exercise
the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of
religious worship.” The statute imposes a range of civil
penalties, and it allows enforcement suits by both private persons
and government officials. See, e.g., United States v.
Dillard, 795 F.3d 1191, 1196–1197 (CA10 2015)
(Government brought §248 action after defendant warned a
health provider, “[y]ou will be checking under your car
everyday—because maybe today is the day someone places an
explosive under it”); McCullen v. Coakley,
573 U.S.
464, 491 (2014) (noting that several States have similar laws).
After today, these civil enforcement actions face a higher
constitutional hurdle.

															In addition, employers and school administrators
often discipline individuals who make true threats. Consider the
student who was expelled after “draft[ing] two violent,
misogynic, and obscenity-laden rants expressing a desire to molest,
rape, and murder” his ex-girlfriend. Doe v. Pulaski
Cty. Special School Dist., 
306 F.3d 616, 619 (CA8 2002) (en banc). Or the one who was
suspended after “ ‘talking about taking a gun to
school’ to ‘shoot everyone he
hates.’ ” D. J. M. v. Hannibal
Public School Dist. No. 60, 647 F.3d 754, 758 (CA8 2011);
Lovell v. Poway Unified School District, 
90 F.3d 367, 369, 372–373 (CA9 1996) (similar);
Haughwout v. Tordenti, 332 Conn. 559, 561–562,
211 A.3d 1, 3–4 (2019) (similar). True threats can also be
expressed by a parent, a teacher, or an employee in another context
altogether. See, e.g., Taveras, 342 Conn., at
567–569, 578, 271 A. 3d, at 126–128, 133 (parent);
Smith v. New York City Dept. of Ed., 109 App. Div. 3d
701, 702–703, 972 N.Y.S.2d 221, 222 (2013) (teacher);
Diggs v. St. Louis, 613 S.W.3d 858, 862, 864
(Mo. App. 2020) (correctional officer).

															Barring some reason why the speech receives
lesser constitutional protection, e.g., Mahanoy Area
School Dist. v. B. L., 594 U. S. ___,
___–___ (2021) (slip op., at 4–5), the Court’s
new rule applies to all of these situations. That can make all the
difference in some cases. A delusional speaker may lack awareness
of the threatening nature of her speech; a devious speaker may
strategically disclaim such awareness; and a lucky speaker may
leave behind no evidence of mental state for the government to use
against her. The Court’s decision thus sweeps much further
than it lets on.

															*  *  *

															The bottom line is this: Counterman
communicated true threats, which, “everyone agrees, lie
outside the bounds of the First Amendment’s
protection.” Ante, at 4. He knew what the words meant.
Those threats caused the victim to fear for her life, and they
“upended her daily existence.” Ante, at 2.
Nonetheless, the Court concludes that Counterman can prevail on a
First Amendment defense. Nothing in the Constitution compels that
result. I respectfully dissent.

Notes
1
 Indeed, the Colorado
Legislature considered these very harms when it enacted the statute
at issue here. The statutory findings explain that stalking,
harassment, and threats have “an immediate and long-lasting
impact on quality of life as well as risks to security and safety
of the victim and persons close to the victim.” Colo. Rev.
Stat. §§18–3–601(1)(f),
18–3–602(1) (2022). So the legislature passed the
statute to “encourag[e] and authoriz[e] effective
intervention” before the covered conduct could
“escalate into behavior that has even more serious
consequences.” §18–3–601(2).

 The Court also cites
Elonis v. United States, ante, at 8, 9,
n. 4, which Counterman argues puts a “gloss” on
obscenity doctrine, Tr. of Oral Arg. 6–7. While Elonis
briefly discusses the necessary mens rea for a conviction
under a federal obscenity statute, it does so only in dicta. 575
U.S. 723, 739–740 (2015). Elonis does not alter the
doctrinal framework for assessing the constitutionality of
obscenity laws: That case involves true threats, not obscenity, and
it interprets a federal statute, not the Constitution.

 Colorado’s test
provides a good example. Juries must apply the following
nonexhaustive factors to determine whether a statement is a true
threat: “(1) the statement’s role in a broader
exchange, if any, including surrounding events; (2) the medium or
platform through which the statement was communicated, including
any distinctive conventions or architectural features; (3) the
manner in which the statement was conveyed (e.g.,
anonymously or not, privately or publicly); (4) the relationship
between the speaker and recipient(s); and (5) the subjective
reaction of the statement’s intended or foreseeable
recipient(s).” People in the Interest of R. D., 464
P.3d 717, 721–722 (Colo. 2020).

 As Justice Sotomayor
emphasizes, ante, at 10, n. 4, the plurality said that
context informs “whether a particular cross burning is
intended to intimidate,” 538 U. S., at 367
(emphasis added). But this was a reference to the statutory
requirements for a conviction, not the constitutional
requirements—the Virginia statute covered only threats made
“ ‘with the intent of intimidating any person or
group of persons.’ ” Id., at 348. At no
point did the Court hold that the First Amendment demands specific
intent; on the contrary, it recognized that a statement made
“with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm
or death” is “a type of true threat.”
Id., at 360 (emphasis added).
