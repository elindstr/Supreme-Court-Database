															CARLOS TREVINO, PETITIONER v. RICK
THALER, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,
CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[May 28, 2013]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Alito
joins, dissenting.

															In our federal system, the “state courts
are the principal forum for asserting constitutional challenges to
state convictions.” Harrington v. Richter, 562
U. S. __, __ (2011) (slip op., at 13). “Federal courts
sitting in habeas,” we have said, “are not an
alternative forum for trying . . . issues which a
prisoner made insufficient effort to pursue in state
proceedings.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S.
420, 437 (2000). This basic principle reflects the fact that
federal habeas review “ ‘intrudes on state
sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal
judicial authority.’ ” Richter,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Harris v.
Reed, 489 U.S.
255, 282 (1989) (Kennedy, J., dissenting)).

															In order to prevent circumvention of the state
courts and the unjustified intrusion on state sovereignty that
results, we have held that “a state prisoner [who] fails to
exhaust state remedies . . . [or] has failed to meet the
State’s procedural requirements for presenting his federal
claims” will not be entitled to federal habeas relief unless
he can show “cause” to excuse his default.
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S.
722, 732, 750 (1991). There is an exception to that rule where
“failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental
miscarriage of justice,” ibid.; that exception is not
at issue here.

															Cause comes in different forms, but the one
relevant here is attorney error. We recognized in Coleman
that “[w]here a [habeas] petitioner defaults a claim as a
result of the denial of the right to effective assistance of
counsel, the State, which is responsible for the denial as a
constitutional matter, must bear the cost of any resulting
default.” Id., at 754. But we simultaneously
recognized that “[a] different allocation of costs is
appropriate in those circumstances where the State has no
responsibility to ensure that the petitioner was represented by
competent counsel.” Ibid. In that situation, we held,
“it is the petitioner who must bear the burden of a failure
to follow state proce-dural rules.” Ibid. Because the
error in Coleman occurred during state postconviction
proceedings, a point at which the habeas petitioner had no
constitutional right to counsel, the petitioner had to bear the
cost of his default. Id., at 757.

															Last Term, in Martinez v. Ryan, we
announced a “narrow exception” to
Coleman’s “unqualified statement . . .
that an attorney’s ignorance or inadvertence in a
postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a
procedural default.” 566 U.S.
1, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6). In Martinez, Arizona law
did not allow defendants to raise ineffective assistance of counsel
claims on direct appeal; they could only raise such claims
in state collateral proceedings. Id., at ___ (slip op., at
2). We held that while Arizona was free to structure its state
court procedures in this way, its “decision is not without
consequences for the State’s ability to assert a procedural
default in later proceedings.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,
at 10). “By deliberately choosing to move
trial-ineffectiveness claims outside of the direct-appeal process,
where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed, the State
significantly diminishes prisoners’ ability to file such
claims.” Ibid. Thus, “within the context of this
state procedural framework,” attorney error would qualify as
cause to excuse procedural default if it occurred in the first
proceeding at which the prisoner was “allow[ed]” to
raise his trial ineffectiveness claim. Id., at ___, ___
(slip op., at 10, 13).

															We were unusually explicit about the narrowness
of our decision: “The holding in this case does not concern
attorney errors in other kinds of proceedings,” and
“does not extend to attorney errors in any proceeding beyond
the first occasion the State allows a prisoner to raise a claim of
ineffective assistance at trial.” Id., at
___–___ (slip op., at 13–14). “Our holding here
addresses only the constitutional claims presented in this case,
where the State barred the defendant from raising the claims on
direct appeal.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14). In
“all but the limited circumstances recognized here,” we
said, “[t]he rule of Coleman governs.”
Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).

															This aggressively limiting language was not
simply a customary nod to the truism that “we decide only the
case before us.” Upjohn Co. v. United States,
449 U.S.
383, 396 (1981). It was instead an important part of our
explanation for why “[t]his limited qualification to
Coleman does not implicate the usual concerns with upsetting
reliance interests protected by stare decisis
principles.” Martinez, supra, at ___ (slip op.,
at 12). The fact that the exception was clearly delineated ensured
that the Coleman rule would remain administrable. And
because States could readily anticipate how such a sharply defined
exception would apply to various procedural frameworks, the
exception could be reconciled with our concerns for comity and
equitable balancing that led to Coleman’s baseline
rule in the first place. See Coleman, supra, at
750–751. The States had a clear choice, which they could make
with full knowledge of the consequences: If a State
“deliberately cho[se] to move trial-ineffectiveness claims
outside of the direct-appeal process” through a
“decision to bar defendants from raising” them there,
then—and only then—would “counsel’s
ineffectiveness in an initial-review collateral proceeding
qualif[y] as cause for a procedural default.”
Martinez, 566 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 10,
14).

															Today, with hardly a mention of these concerns,
the majority throws over the crisp limit we made so explicit just
last Term. We announced in Martinez that the exception
applies “where the State barred the defendant from raising
the claims on direct appeal.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,
at 14). But today, the Court takes all the starch out of its rule
with an assortment of adjectives, adverbs, and modifying clauses:
Martinez’s “narrow exception” now applies
whenever the “state procedural framework, by reason of its
design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case
that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity” to raise
his claim on direct appeal. Ante, at 14.

															The questions raised by this equitable equation
are as endless as will be the state-by-state litigation it takes to
work them out. We are not told, for example, how meaningful is
meaningful enough, how meaningful-ness is to be measured, how
unlikely highly unlikely is, how often a procedural
framework’s “operation” must be reassessed, or
what case qualifies as the “typical” case. Take just
this last example: The case before us involved a jury trial (hardly
typical), a capital conviction (even less typical), and—as
the majority emphasizes—a particular species of
ineffectiveness claim that depends on time-consuming investigation
of personal background and other mitigating circumstances.
Ante, at 10. Yet the majority holds it up, apparently, as a
case that is typical in the relevant sense, saying that
“[t]he present capital case illustrates” the
“systematic” working of Texas’s procedural
framework. Ibid.

															Given that the standard is so opaque and
malleable, the majority cannot describe the exception applied here
as narrow, and does not do so. Gone are the repeated words of
limitation that characterized the Martinez opinion. Gone too
is the clear choice that Martinez gave the States about how
to structure their criminal justice systems. Now, the majority
offers them a gamble: If a State allows defendants to bring
ineffectiveness claims both on direct appeal and in postconviction
proceedings, then a prisoner might have to comply with state
procedural requirements in order to preserve the availability of
federal habeas review, if a federal judge decides that the
state system gave the defendant (or enough other
“typical” defendants) a sufficiently meaningful
opportunity to press his claim.

															This invitation to litigation will, in precisely
the manner that Coleman foreclosed,
“ ‘frustrate both the States’ sovereign
power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor
constitutional rights.’ ” Coleman, 501
U. S., at 748 (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S.
107, 128 (1982)). In what I suspect (though cannot know) will
be a broad swath of cases, the Court’s approach will excuse
procedural defaults that, under Coleman, should preclude
federal review. But even in cases where federal courts ultimately
decide that the habeas petitioner cannot establish cause under the
new standard, the years of procedural wrangling it takes to reach
that decision will themselves undermine the finality of sentences
necessary to effective criminal justice. Because that approach is
inconsistent with Coleman, Martinez itself, and the
principles of equitable discretion and comity at the heart of both,
I respectfully dissent.
