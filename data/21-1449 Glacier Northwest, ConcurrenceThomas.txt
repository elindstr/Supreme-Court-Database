															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–1449

															_________________

															GLACIER NORTHWEST, INC., dba CALPORTLAND,
PETITIONER v. INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL
UNION NO. 174

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
washington

															[June 1, 2023]

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch
joins, concurring in the judgment.

															I agree that petitioner’s state-court
claims are not pre-empted by the National Labor Relations Act
(NLRA). The majority reaches this conclusion, however, by applying
the Court’s precedent in San Diego Building Trades
Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S.
236 (1959), which held that state courts are disabled from
adjudicating state-law claims that concern conduct
“arguably” protected under the NLRA. Id., at
245–246. Because this Court has previously held that the type
of conduct alleged here is not protected, I join Justice
Alito’s opinion concurring in the judgment. I write
separately to emphasize the oddity of Garmon’s broad
pre-emption regime.

															This Court typically applies a high bar before
concluding that federal law “strip[s] state courts of
jurisdiction to hear their own state claims.”
Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Christian, 590 U. S.
___, ___–___ (2020) (slip op., at 11–12). Likewise, the
Court generally requires a “clear” purpose to displace
state law before finding that a federal statute does so.
Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S.
555, 565 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).

															As the majority notes, however, Garmon
“goes beyond the usual preemption rule.” Ante,
at 3. In Garmon, the Court determined that, “[w]hen an
activity is arguably subject to §7 or §8 of the
Act” (which, respectively, concern employees’ right to
engage in concerted activity and unfair labor practices),
“the States as well as the federal courts must defer to the
exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board [(NLRB
or Board)].” 359 U. S., at 245. The Court went on to
explain that this prophylactic rule of pre-emption may apply even
to state-court claims arising under state private law (rather than
the NLRA or a comparable state regulatory scheme) and even to
claims seeking remedies not available from the Board. Id.,
at 246–248.[1]* Nor,
under the Court’s rule, is the State’s power to act
restored if the NLRB “fail[s] to determine the status of the
disputed conduct by declining to assert jurisdiction, or by refusal
. . . to file a charge; or by adopting some other
disposition which does not define the nature of the activity with
unclouded legal significance.” Id., at
245–246.

															Garmon acknowledged that the NLRA’s
pre-emption implications “ ‘are of a Delphic
nature,’ ” leaving the States’ residual
power in a “ ‘penumbral area [that] can be
rendered progressively clear only by the course of
litigation.’ ” Id., at 240–241
(quoting Machinists v. Gonzales, 356 U.S.
617, 619 (1958); Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.,
348 U.S.
468, 480–481 (1955)). It thus emphasized that
“Congress has entrusted administration of the labor policy
for the Nation to a centralized administrative agency,”
making it “essential to the administration of the Act”
that determinations about protected and prohibited conduct
“be left in the first instance to the [NLRB].” 359
U. S., at 242, 244–245. To do otherwise, it feared,
“would create potential frustration of national
purposes” and invite “the danger of state interference
with national policy.” Id., at 244–245.

															Justice Harlan concurred in the result, warning
that the majority’s rule would “reduc[e] to the
vanishing point” States’ “power to redress
wrongful acts in the labor field” and provide any
“effective remedy under their own laws for . . .
tortious conduct.” Id., at 253–254. The years
since have borne out that warning. Garmon elevates
“even the remotest possibility of conflict,” thereby
“overstat[ing ] the likelihood and significance of conflicts
and . . . set[ting] up an unreal goal of doctrinal and
factual harmony.” L. Jaffe, Primary Jurisdiction, 77 Harv.
L. Rev. 1037, 1053 (1964). In effect, “Garmon
doctrine completely pre-empts state-court jurisdiction unless the
Board determines that the disputed conduct is neither protected nor
prohibited by the [NLRA].” Sears, Roebuck & Co. v.
Carpenters, 436 U.S.
180, 199, n. 29 (1978).

															The majority opinion today underscores the
strangeness of the Garmon regime. Here, the Supreme Court of
the United States reassures a state court of its power to
adjudicate a state-law tort claim. The Court does so, not based on
its own judgment that federal law does not pre-empt the claim, but
because the NLRB’s existing precedents adequately remove any
“[c]lou[d]” over the matter. 359 U. S., at 246.
But, if the Board’s precedents left the matter
“arguable” (and the NLRA did not plainly dictate an
answer), then the state courts would be “ousted” of
jurisdiction. Longshoremen v. Davis, 476 U.S.
380, 396 (1986). The upshot of this approach appears to be that
the scope of the NLRA’s pre-emption of state-court
jurisdiction over state claims is defined—not by the
statutory text—but by “penumbra[s]” that wax and
wane as the Board develops, or declines to develop, its own
carefully insulated common law of labor relations. Garmon,
359 U. S., at 240 (internal quotation marks omitted).

															The parties here have not asked us to reconsider
Garmon, nor is it necessary to do so to resolve this case.
Nonetheless, in an appropriate case, we should carefully reexamine
whether the law supports Garmon’s
“unusual” pre-emption regime. Ante, at 2. In
doing so, I would bear in mind that any proper pre-emption inquiry
must focus on the NLRA’s text and ask whether federal law and
state law “are in logical contradiction,” such that it
is impossible to comply with both. Merck Sharp & Dohme
Corp. v. Albrecht, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019)
(Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2); see also PLIVA,
Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.S.
604, 617–618 (2011).

Notes
1
*Nonetheless, and motivated by
“due regard for the presuppositions of our embracing federal
system,” Garmon carved out two areas of presumptive
state control: (1) “where the activity regulated was a merely
peripheral concern of the [NLRA as amended],” and (2) where
it “touched interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and
responsibility that, in the absence of compelling congressional
direction, [the Court] could not infer that Congress had deprived
the States of the power to act.” 359 U. S., at
243–244.
