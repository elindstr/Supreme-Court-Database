556 U. S. ____ (2009)
ASHCROFT V. IQBAL
556 U. S. ____ (2009)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 07-1015

															JOHN D. ASHCROFT, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL,
et al., PETITIONERS v. JAVAID IQBAL et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the second circuit

															[May 18, 2009]

															   Justice Breyer, dissenting.

															   I agree with Justice Souter and
join his dissent. I write separately to point out that, like the
Court, I believe it important to prevent unwarranted litigation
from interfering with “the proper execution of the work of
the Government.” Ante, at 21. But I cannot find in
that need adequate justification for the Court’s
interpretation of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,
550 U. S. 544
(2007), and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. The law, after all,
provides trial courts with other legal weapons designed to prevent
unwarranted interference. As the Second Circuit explained, where a
Government defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense, a trial
court, responsible for managing a case and “mindful of the
need to vindicate the purpose of the qualified immunity
defense,” can structure discovery in ways that diminish the
risk of imposing unwarranted burdens upon public officials. See
Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 158 (2007). A
district court, for example, can begin discovery with lower level
government defendants before determining whether a case can be made
to allow discovery related to higher level government officials.
See ibid. Neither the briefs nor the Court’s opinion
provides convincing grounds for finding these alternative
case-management tools inadequate, either in general or in the case
before us. For this reason, as well as for the independently
sufficient reasons set forth in Justice Souter’s opinion, I
would affirm the Second Circuit.
