															ADOLFO R. ARELLANO, PETITIONER v. DENIS
R. McDONOUGH, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[January 23, 2023]

															

															Justice Barrett delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															This case concerns the effective date of an
award of disability compensation to a veteran of the United States
military. The governing statute provides that the effective date of
the award “shall not be earlier” than the day on which
the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) receives the
veteran’s application for benefits. But the statute specifies
16 exceptions, one of which is relevant here: If the VA receives
the application within a year of the veteran’s discharge, the
effective date is the day after the veteran’s discharge. We
must decide whether this exception is subject to equitable tolling,
a doctrine that would allow some applications filed outside the
1-year period to qualify for the “day after discharge”
effective date. We hold that the provision cannot be equitably
tolled.

															I

															A

															The United States offers benefits to any
veteran who suffers a service-connected disability. 38
U. S. C. §§1110, 1131. A veteran seeking these
benefits must file a claim with the VA. §5101(a)(1)(A).
“A regional office of the VA then determines whether the
veteran satisfies all legal prerequisites, including the
requirement that military service caused or aggravated the
disability.” George v. McDonough, 596
U. S. ___, ___–___ (2022) (slip op., at 1–2). If
the regional office grants the application, it assigns an
“effective date” to the award, and payments begin the
month after that date. §§5110(a)(1), 5111(a)(1). If the
effective date precedes the date on which the VA received the
claim, the veteran receives retroactive benefits.

															Section 5110 dictates how this date is
calculated. The default rule is that “the effective date of
an award . . . shall be fixed in accordance with the
facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of
application therefor.” §5110(a)(1). This rule applies
“[u]nless specifically provided otherwise in this
chapter.” Ibid. Sixteen exceptions in §5110
“provid[e] otherwise,” including one specifying that
“[t]he effective date of an award of disability compensation
to a veteran shall be the day following the date of the
veteran’s discharge or release if application therefor is
received within one year from such date of discharge or
release.” §5110(b)(1). On its face, this exception
allows up to one year of retroactive benefits. But if the VA can
treat an application filed more than one year after discharge as if
it had been filed within the statutory window, a veteran could
potentially recover decades’ worth of retroactive
payments.

															B

															Adolfo Arellano served in the Navy from 1977
until his honorable discharge in 1981. Approximately 30 years
later, the VA received Arellano’s application for disability
compensation based on his psychiatric disorders. A VA regional
office found that Arellano’s disorders resulted from trauma
that he suffered while serving on an aircraft carrier that collided
with another ship. So the regional office granted Arellano benefits
for his service-connected disabilities—schizoaffective
disorder bipolar type with posttraumatic stress disorder. It
assigned an effective date of June 3, 2011, the day that the VA
received his claim.

															Arellano appealed the regional office’s
decision to the VA’s Board of Veterans’ Appeals. He
acknowledged that he did not submit an application for benefits
until June 2011. But he argued that the regional office should have
equitably tolled §5110(b)(1)’s 1-year timeline to make
his award effective as of the day after his discharge from service
in 1981 or, at the latest, January 1, 1982. In support of equitable
tolling, Arellano alleged that he had been too ill to know that he
could apply for service-connected disability benefits. The Board
denied Arellano’s request for equitable tolling, and the
Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed.

															The en banc Federal Circuit affirmed the
judgment unanimously but divided equally on the supporting
rationale. Half the court, adhering to Circuit precedent,
maintained that §5110(b)(1) is not subject to equitable
tolling. 1 F. 4th 1059, 1086 (2021) (Chen, J., concurring in
judgment); see Andrews v. Principi, 
351 F.3d 1134 (2003). The other half, rejecting Circuit
precedent, reasoned that §5110(b)(1) is subject to equitable
tolling but that tolling was unwarranted on the facts of
Arellano’s case. 1 F. 4th, at 1099 (Dyk, J., concurring in
judgment).

															We granted certiorari to resolve which side had
the better interpretation of the statute. 595 U. S. ___
(2022).

															II

															Equitable tolling “effectively extends
an otherwise discrete limitations period set by Congress.”
Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U.S.
1, 10 (2014). In practice, it “pauses the running of, or
‘tolls,’ a statute of limitations when a litigant has
pursued his rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance
prevents him from bringing a timely action.” Ibid. The
doctrine “is a traditional feature of American jurisprudence
and a background principle against which Congress drafts
limitations periods.” Boechler v. Commissioner,
596 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 8). Consistent with
this jurisprudential backdrop, we presume that federal statutes of
limitations are subject to equitable tolling. Irwin v.
Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S.
89, 95–96 (1990). The Irwin presumption, however,
is just that—a presumption. It can be rebutted, and if
equitable tolling is inconsistent with the statutory scheme, courts
cannot stop the clock for even the most deserving plaintiff.
John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,
552 U.S.
130, 137–138 (2008); United States v.
Beggerly, 524 U.S.
38, 48–49 (1998).

															The Secretary of Veterans Affairs advances two
reasons why §5110(b)(1) is not subject to equitable tolling.
The first would head tolling off at the pass: He argues that
§5110(b)(1) is not a statute of limitations, so the
presumption is wholly inapplicable. See Lozano, 572
U. S., at 13–14 (“[W]e have only applied”
Irwin’s presumption “to statutes of
limitations”). Rather than extinguishing a tardy claim (the
function of a statute of limitations), §5110(b)(1) caps the
award for a successful claim (a different function). Brief for
Respondent 18–22. That it does so with reference to the time
of filing, the Secretary says, does not convert it into a statute
of limitations. Id., at 21. In any event, the Secretary
adds, equitable tolling is at odds with the statutory text and
structure—so even assuming that §5110(b)(1) sets a
limitations period, the presumption is rebutted.

															We need not address the Secretary’s first
argument because the second is straightforward. The presumption is
rebutted if “there [is] good reason to believe that Congress
did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply.”
United States v. Brockamp, 519
U.S. 347, 350 (1997). In this case, there is very good reason
to draw that conclusion. Section 5110 contains detailed
instructions for when a veteran’s claim for benefits may
enjoy an effective date earlier than the one provided by the
default rule. It would be inconsistent with this comprehensive
scheme for an adjudicator to extend effective dates still further
through the doctrine of equitable tolling.[1]

															A

															Start with the text. Section 5110(b)(1)
operates as a limited exception to §5110(a)(1)’s default
rule, which states that “the effective date of an award
. . . shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found,
but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application
therefor.” The default applies “[u]nless specifically
provided otherwise in this chapter”—a clause indicating
that Congress enumerated an exhaustive list of exceptions, with
each confined to its specific terms. §5110(a)(1). According to
the terms of the exception in §5110(b)(1), “[t]he
effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran
shall be the day following the date of the veteran’s
discharge or release if application therefor is received within one
year from such date of discharge or release.” Equitably
tolling this provision would depart from the terms that Congress
“specifically provided.” §5110(a)(1).

															The structure of §5110 reinforces
Congress’s choice to set effective dates solely as prescribed
in the text. The statute sets out detailed instructions that
explain when various types of benefits qualify for an effective
date earlier than the default. There are 16 such
exceptions—and equitable tolling is not on the list. See
§§5110(b)(1), (b)(2)(A), (b)(3), (b)(4)(A), (c), (d),
(e)(1), (e)(2), (f ), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l), (n).
Notably, these exceptions do not operate simply as time
constraints, but also as substantive limitations on the amount of
recovery due. See, e.g., §5110(g) (“In no event
shall [an] award or increase [under this paragraph] be retroactive
for more than one year from the date of application therefor or the
date of administrative determination of entitlement, whichever is
earlier”). We stated in Brockamp that an
“explicit listing of exceptions” in a statute
containing “detail” and describing “not only
procedural limitations, but also substantive limitations on the
amount of recovery” strongly indicated that “Congress
did not intend courts to read other unmentioned, open-ended,
‘equitable’ exceptions into the statute that it
wrote.” 519 U. S., at 352. So too here. If Congress
wanted the VA to adjust a claimant’s entitlement to
retroactive benefits based on unmentioned equitable factors, it is
difficult to see why it spelled out a long list of situations in
which a claimant is entitled to adjustment—and instructed the
VA to stick to the exceptions “specifically provided.”
§5110(a)(1).

															That many of the specific exceptions reflect
equitable considerations heightens the structural inference.
Several, including §5110(b)(1), apply when the event
triggering the entitlement to benefits is disability or
death—both circumstances in which prompt filing could be
challenging for a veteran or her survivors. See
§§5110(b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(4)(A), (d); cf. Lozano,
572 U. S., at 10 (noting that equitable tolling may be
appropriate when a person diligently pursues her rights but an
“extraordinary circumstance prevents [her] from bringing a
timely action”). One permits an earlier effective date for
the award of benefits to a veteran’s child, a claimant
typically dependent on others for prompt filing. §5110(e)(1).
Still others permit retroactive benefits when facts change or new
evidence emerges. See §5110(h) (permitting retroactive
benefits when actual income would increase a pension that had been
awarded based on anticipated income); §5110(i) (permitting
retroactive benefits when “any disallowed claim is
readjudicated and thereafter allowed on the basis of new and
relevant evidence resulting from the correction of ”
certain military records). Yet despite its attention to fairness,
Congress did not throw the door wide open in these circumstances or
any other. In all but one instance, Congress capped retroactive
benefits at roughly one year.[2]

															This pattern matters. That Congress accounted
for equitable factors in setting effective dates strongly suggests
that it did not expect an adjudicator to add a broader range of
equitable factors to the mix. And its decision to consistently cap
retroactive benefits strongly suggests that it did not expect
open-ended tolling to dramatically increase the size of an award.
When Congress has already considered equitable concerns and limited
the relief available, “additional equitable tolling would be
unwarranted.” Beggerly, 524 U. S., at
48–49.

															Section 5110(b)(4), another disability-related
exception to the default rule, illustrates the point. Recall that
§5110(b)(1), the exception at issue here, adjusts the
effective date of disability compensation to the day after a
veteran’s discharge from the military, so long as the VA
receives the claim within one year of discharge. Arellano contends
that his claim, filed 30 years after discharge, should relate back
to the date of discharge because his disability prevented him from
filing earlier than he did. But §5110(b)(4), which applies to
disability pensions rather than disability compensation, expressly
accounts for this very concern: It makes pension benefits
retroactive to the date of permanent and total disability if the
disability prevented the veteran from applying for an award at the
time of onset. §§5110(b)(4)(A), (B). The possibility that
disability could cause delay was therefore on Congress’s
radar; still, Congress did not explicitly account for it in
§5110(b)(1). Moreover, while Arellano posits an open-ended
grace period for §5110(b)(1), §5110(b)(4)(A) imposes a
restrictive one: It applies only “if the veteran applies for
a retroactive award within one year” of “the date on
which the veteran became permanently and totally disabled.”
Why would Congress allow an unlimited grace period for an equitable
concern unmentioned in §5110(b)(1) when it established a
limited grace period for the same concern explicitly mentioned in
§5110(b)(4)? Tolling §5110(b)(1) would single it out for
special treatment; enforcing its terms keeps it consistent with the
statutory scheme.

															The most compelling argument for equitable
tolling is that hard and fast limits on retroactive benefits can
create harsh results. The statutory default ties the start of
benefits to the application-receipt date, a choice that
incentivizes promptness and disfavors retroactive awards. The
exceptions granting a 1-year grace period soften that choice in
specified circumstances, yet there are situations in which
equity’s flexible, open-ended approach would be more generous
to a deserving claimant. With this in mind, Congress could have
designed a scheme that allowed adjudicators to maximize fairness in
every case. But Congress has the power to choose between rules,
which prioritize efficiency and predictability, and standards,
which prioritize optimal results in individual cases. Cf.
Brockamp, 519 U. S., at 352–353 (observing that
“Congress decided to pay the price of occasional unfairness
in individual cases . . . in order to maintain a more
workable tax enforcement system”). Congress opted for rules
in this statutory scheme, and an equitable extension of
§5110(b)(1)’s 1-year grace period would disrupt that
choice.

															B

															Arellano contests all of this. Laser focused
on §5110(b)(1), he argues that the provision’s unadorned
text contains none of the specific, technical language that might
otherwise rebut the presumption of equitable tolling. In addition,
he emphasizes that there are “zero express exceptions
to §5110(b)(1)’s one-year clock,” which he
describes as “fatal” to the Secretary’s position.
Reply Brief 14. As Arellano sees it, §5110(b)(1) is a simple
time limit and therefore a classic case for equitable tolling.

															If §5110(b)(1) stood alone, there might be
something to Arellano’s argument. (Again, assuming that
§5110(b)(1) is a limitations period to which the Irwin
presumption applies.) But §5110(b)(1) cannot be understood
independently of §5110(a)(1), which makes the date of receipt
the effective date “[u]nless specifically provided otherwise
in this chapter.” Arellano insists that the Secretary
overreads “unless” by treating it as a signal that the
enacted exceptions are exclusive. Brief for Petitioner 31–32.
But the clause says more than “unless”—it says
that the default applies “[u]nless specifically
provided otherwise.” §5110(a)(1) (emphasis added).
That is an instruction to attend to specifically enacted language
to the exclusion of general, unenacted carveouts. While Arellano
claims to seek an equitable exception to a general rule, he
actually seeks an equitable exception to an exception to a general
rule. Structurally, that is a heavy lift. Moreover,
§5110(b)(1) is nestled within a list of 15 other exceptions to
§5110(a)(1)’s default rule, and, as we have already
explained, the presence of this detailed, lengthy list raises the
inference that the enumerated exceptions are exclusive.

															Arellano also resists the proposition that the
express accounting for disability-caused delay in §5110(b)(4)
hurts his case. On the contrary, he insists that it works in his
favor. Citing Young v. United States, 535 U.S.
43 (2002), he maintains that an express tolling provision does
not displace the presumption of tolling but rather demonstrates
that a statute incorporates traditional equitable principles. Brief
for Petitioner 37–38. According to Arellano, Congress’s
silence in §5110(b)(1) merely shows that it wanted those
traditional principles to apply at full strength. Ibid.;
Reply Brief 19–20.

															We disagree. Section 5110(b)(4) does not help
Arellano; for the reasons we have already explained, it illustrates
why equitably tolling §5110(b)(1) is incongruent with the
statutory scheme. Young is inapposite. There, we concluded
that an “express tolling provision” for a time limit in
a bankruptcy statute supported equitable tolling of a different
time limit in the same statute. 535 U. S., at 53. But that was
largely because the express tolling provision authorized tolling
where equity would not otherwise have permitted it. Ibid. As
a result, we interpreted the express tolling provision to
“supplemen[t] rather than displac[e] principles of equitable
tolling.” Ibid. (emphasis deleted). Here, however,
§5110(b)(4) does not authorize tolling that equity would not
otherwise have allowed. If anything, its conditional and narrow
applicability limits tolling that might otherwise have occurred.
Though Arellano makes a valiant effort to turn a negative into a
positive, §5110(b)(4) remains an obstacle to his
interpretation.

															Finally, Arellano contends that “the
‘nature of the underlying subject
matter’ ”—veterans’
benefits—counsels in favor of tolling here. Brief for
Petitioner 33–34. To support this proposition, he invokes
Brockamp, which considered whether courts can equitably toll
time limits for filing tax-refund claims. 519 U. S., at 348.
After holding that the statute’s text and structure rebutted
the Irwin presumption, we observed that the “nature of
the underlying subject matter—tax
collection—underscore[d] the linguistic point.”
Brockamp, 519 U. S., at 352. “Tax law, after all,
is not normally characterized by case-specific exceptions
reflecting individualized equities.” Ibid. By
contrast, Arellano argues, providing benefits to veterans is a
context in which individualized equities are paramount. See
King v. St. Vincent’s Hospital, 502 U.S.
215, 220, n. 9 (1991) (“[P]rovisions for benefits to
members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the
beneficiaries’ favor”).

															If the text and structure favored Arellano, the
nature of the subject matter would garnish an already solid
argument. But the nature of the subject matter cannot overcome text
and structure that foreclose equitable tolling. Brockamp
turned to the “nature of the underlying subject matter”
only to “underscor[e] the linguistic point.” 519
U. S., at 352. Arellano, however, lacks the linguistic point.
This is not a case in which competing interpretations are equally
plausible; it is one in which Congress’s choice is
evident.[3]

															*  *  *

															We hold that §5110(b)(1) is not subject
to equitable tolling and affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 Equitable tolling, a
judicial doctrine, is typically applied by courts. See
Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.S.
145, 158–159 (2013). In this case, Arellano posits that
the VA would apply the doctrine in the first instance. Reply Brief
18–19; Tr. of Oral Arg. 16–17. The Secretary counters
that the doctrine is not presumptively available to agencies
because they possess no equitable power unless Congress grants it
to them—which, he says, Congress has not done here. Brief for
Respondent 32–35. We need not settle this dispute. Our
conclusion that the presumption is rebutted means that no
adjudicator, whether an agency or a court, may equitably toll the
effective date.
2
 Thirteen of the
exceptions, including §5110(b)(1), allow an effective date up
to one year before the application-receipt date. See, e.g.,
§5110(b)(3) (“The effective date of an award of
increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is
ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if
application is received within one year from such date”
(emphasis added)). Two exceptions contemplate the possibility that
the effective date of an award might stretch up to one day short of
13 months before the application-receipt date. See
§§5110(d) (“The effective date of an award of death
compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or death
pension for which application is received within one year from the
date of death shall be the first day of the month in which the
death occurred”), (e)(1). The only one offering more than 13
months of retroactive benefits concerns the death of an active-duty
servicemember. This provision permits an award of death
compensation to be effective as of the month of death, no matter
how long ago the death occurred—but still, retroactive
benefits are permitted only if the VA receives the application
within one year of the military’s entry of a report or
finding of the servicemember’s death.
§5110( j).

 We resolve only the
applicability of equitable tolling to §5110(b)(1). We do not
address the applicability of other equitable doctrines, such as
waiver, forfeiture, and estoppel.
