															 The invoice is headed 'Glasgow, 8th July, 1812. 'Messrs. George Stayley & Co. 'Receive from James Smith.'  A letter from James Smith to George Stayley & Co. in speaking of the goods, terms them 'our goods,' and does not, in any manner, indicate that they are the goods of Stayley & Co. He concludes his letter with saying, 'As it is to be hoped the trade will now open, 'I shall expect your instructions saying what goods 'are best suited for the market.'  The bill of lading is filled up with the name of George Stayley & Co. ' on account and risk as per invoice.'  There are several letters from George Stayley, in Glasgow, to his father; but none of them indicate an opinion that the property of the goods was in George Stayley & Co:  The sentence, condemning these goods, must be affirmed.
