v. SANDOZ, INC., etÂ al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the federal circuit

															[January 20, 2015]

															Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															In Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,517
U.Â S. 370 (1996), we explained that a patent claim is
that â€œportion of the patent document that
defines the scope of the patenteeâ€™s
rights.â€ Id., at 372. We held that
â€œthe construction of a patent, including terms
of art within its claim,â€ is not for a jury but
â€œexclusivelyâ€ for
â€œthe courtâ€ to determine.
Ibid. That is so even where the construction of a term of
art has â€œevidentiary underpinnings.â€
Id., at 390.

															Todayâ€™s case involves claim construction with
â€œevidentiary underpinnings.â€ See
Part III, infra. And, it requires us to determine what
standard the Court of Appeals should use when it reviews a trial
judgeâ€™s resolution of an underlying factual
dispute. Should the Court of Appeals review the district
courtâ€™s factfinding de novo as it would
review a question of law? Or, should it review that factfinding as
it would review a trial judgeâ€™s factfinding in
other cases, namely by taking them as correct
â€œunless clearly erroneous?â€ See Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6). We hold that the appellate court must
apply a â€œclear error,â€ not a de
novo, standard of review.

															I

															The basic dispute in this case concerns the meaning of the words
â€œmolecular weightâ€ as those words
appear in a patent claim. The petitioners, Teva Pharmaceuticals
(along with related firms), own the relevant patent. The patent
covers a manufacturing method for Copaxone, a drug used to treat
multiple sclerosis. The drugâ€™s active
ingredient, called â€œcopolymer-1,â€ is
made up of molecules of varying sizes. App. 1143a. And the relevant
claim describes that ingredient as having â€œa
molecular weight of 5 to 9 kilodaltons.â€ Id., at
1145a.

															The respondents, Sandoz, Inc. (and several other firms), tried
to market a generic version of Copaxone. Teva sued Sandoz for
patent infringement. 810 F.Â Supp. 2d 578, 581 (SDNY
2011). Sandoz defended the suit by arguing that the patent was
invalid. Ibid. The Patent Act requires that a claim
â€œparticularly poin[t] out and distinctly clai[m]
the subject matter which the applicant regards as his
invention.â€35 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§112 Â¶2 (2006 ed.); see Nautilus,
Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572 U.Â S.
___, ___, n. 1 (2014) (slip op., at 3, n. 1)). The phrase
â€œmolecular weight of 5 to 9
kilodaltons,â€ said Sandoz, did not satisfy this
requirement.

															The reason that the phrase is fatally indefinite, Sandoz argued,
is that, in the context of this patent claim, the term
â€œmolecular weightâ€ might mean any
one of three different things. The phrase might refer (1) to
molecular weight as calculated by the weight of the molecule that
is most prevalent in the mix that makes up copolymer-1. (The
scientific term for molecular weight so calculated is, we are told,
â€œpeak average molecular weight.â€)
The phrase might refer (2) to molecular weight as calculated by
taking all the different-sized molecules in the mix that makes up
copolymer-1 and calculating the average weight, i.e., adding
up the weight of each molecule and dividing by the number of
molecules. (The scientific term for molecular weight so calculated
is, we are told, â€œnumber average molecular
weight.â€) Or, the phrase might refer (3) to molecular
weight as calculated by taking all the different-sized molecules in
the mix that makes up copolymer-1 and calculating their average
weight while giving heavier molecules a weight-related bonus when
doing so. (The scientific term for molecular weight so calculated,
we are told, is â€œweight average molecular
weight.â€) See 723 F.Â 3d 1363, 1367 (CA Fed.
2013); App. 124a. In Sandozâ€™s view, since
Tevaâ€™s patent claim does not say which method of
calculation should be used, the claimâ€™s phrase
â€œmolecular weightâ€ is indefinite,
and the claim fails to satisfy the critical patent law
requirement.

															The District Court, after taking evidence from experts,
concluded that the patent claim was sufficiently definite. Among
other things, it found that in context a skilled artisan would
understand that the term â€œmolecular
weightâ€ referred to molecular weight as calculated by
the first method, i.e., â€œpeak average
molecular weight.â€ 810 F.Â Supp. 2d, at 596;
see Nautilus, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 12)
(â€œ[T]he definiteness inquiry trains on the
understanding of a skilled artisan at the time of the patent
applicationâ€). In part for this reason, the District
Court held the patent valid. 810 F.Â Supp. 2d, at
596.

															On appeal, the Federal Circuit held to the contrary. It found
that the term â€œmolecular weightâ€ was
indefinite. And it consequently held the patent invalid. 723
F.Â 3d, at 1369. In reaching this conclusion, the
Federal Circuit reviewed de novo all aspects of the District
Courtâ€™s claim construction, including the
District Courtâ€™s determination of subsidiary
facts. Id., at 1369, 1373; see also Light-ing Ballast
Control LLC v. Philips Electronics NorthAm. Corp., 744
F. 3d 1272, 1276â€“1277 (CA Fed. 2014) (en banc)
(reaffirming de novo review of district court claim
construction).

															Teva filed a petition for certiorari. And we granted that
petition. The Federal Circuit reviews the claim construction
decisions of federal district courts throughout the Nation, and we
consequently believe it important to clarify the standard of review
that it must apply when doing so.

															II

															A

															Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6) states that a court of
appeals â€œmust not .Â .Â .
set asideâ€ a district courtâ€™s
â€œ[fÂ ]indings of factâ€
unless they are â€œclearly erroneous.â€
In our view, this rule and the standard it sets forth must apply
when a court of appeals reviews a district
courtâ€™s resolution of subsidiary factual matters
made in the course of its construction of a patent claim. We have
made clear that the Rule sets forth a â€œclear
command.â€ Anderson v. Bessemer City,470
U.Â S. 564,574 (1985). â€œIt does not
make exceptions or purport to exclude certain categories of factual
findings from the obligation of a court of appeals to accept a
district courtâ€™s findings unless clearly
erroneous.â€ Pullman-Standard v. Swint,456
U. S. 273,287 (1982). Accordingly, the Rule applies to both
subsidiary and ultimate facts. Ibid. And we have said that,
when reviewing the findings of a
â€œÂ â€˜district court
sitting without a jury, appellate courts must constantly have in
mind that their function is not to decide factual issues
deÂ novo.â€™Â â€
Anderson, supra, at 573 (quoting Zenith Radio
Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.,395 U.Â S.
100,123 (1969)).

															Even if exceptions to the Rule were permissible, we cannot find
any convincing ground for creating an exception to that Rule here.
The Rules Advisory Committee pointed out that, in general,
exceptions â€œwould tend to undermine the
legitimacy of the district courts .Â .Â . ,
multiply appeals .Â .Â . , and needlessly
reallocate judicial author-ity.â€ Advisory
Committeeâ€™s 1985 Note on subd. (a) of Fed. Rule
Civ. Proc. 52, 28 U.Â S.Â C. App., pp.
908â€“909; see also Anderson, supra,
at 574â€“575 (de novo review of fac-tual
findings â€œwould very likely contribute only
negligiblyâ€ to accuracy â€œat a huge
cost in diversion of judicialresourcesâ€).

															Our opinion in Markman neither created, nor argued for,
an exception to Rule 52(a). The question presented in that case was
a Seventh Amendment question: Should a jury or a judge construe
patent claims? 517 U.Â S., at 372. We pointed out that
history provides no clear answer. Id., at 388. The task
primarily involves the construction of written instruments.
Id., at 386, 388, 389. And that task is better matched to a
judgeâ€™s skills. Id., at 388
(â€œThe construction of written instruments is one
of those things that judges often do and are likely to do better
than jurors unburdened by training in exegesisâ€). We
consequently held that claim construction falls
â€œexclusively within the province of the
court,â€ not that of the jury. Id., at 372.

															When describing claim construction we concluded that it was
proper to treat the ultimate question of the proper construction of
the patent as a question of law in the way that we treat document
construction as a question of law. Id., at
388â€“391. But this does not imply an exception to
Rule 52(a) for underlying factual disputes. We used the term
â€œquestion of lawâ€ while pointing out
that a judge, in construing a patent claim, is engaged in much the
same task as the judge would be in construing other written
instruments, such as deeds, contracts, or tariffs. Id., at
384, 386, 388, 389; see also Motion Picture Patents Co. v.
Universal Film Mfg. Co.,243 U.Â S. 502,510 (1917)
(patent claims are â€œaptly likened to the
description in a deed, which sets the bounds to the grant which it
containsâ€); Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. v.
Davis,102 U.Â S. 222,227 (1880) (analogizing
patent construction to the construction of other written
instruments like contracts). Construction of written instruments
often presents a â€œquestion solely of
law,â€ at least when the words in those instruments are
â€œused in their ordinary meaning.â€
Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co., 259
U. Â S. 285, 291 (1922). But sometimes, say when a
written instrument uses â€œtechnical words or
phrases not commonly understood,â€ id., at 292,
those words may give rise to a factual dispute. If so, extrinsic
evidence may help to â€œestablish a usage of trade
or locality.â€ Ibid. And in that circumstance,
the â€œdetermination of the matter of
factâ€ will â€œpreced[e]â€
the â€œfunction of construction.â€
Ibid.; see also 12 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts
Â§Â§34:1, p.Â 2, 34:19, p. 174
(4th ed. 2012) (In contract interpretation, the existence of a
â€œusageâ€â€”a
â€œpractice or methodâ€ in the relevant
industryâ€”â€œis a question of
factâ€ (internal quotation marks omitted)). This factual
determination, like all other factual determinations, must be
reviewed for clear error. See Pullman-Standard, supra
at 287 (The Rule does not â€œexclude certain
categories of factual findingsâ€ and applies to both
â€œsubsidiaryâ€ and
â€œultimateâ€ facts (internal quotation
marks omitted)).

															Accordingly, when we held in Markman that the ultimate
question of claim construction is for the judge and not the jury,
we did not create an exception from the ordinary rule governing
appellate review of factual matters. Markman no more creates
an exception to Rule 52(a) than would a holding that judges, not
juries, determine equit-able claims, such as requests for
injunctions. A conclusion that an issue is for the judge does not
indicate that Rule 52(a) is inapplicable. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
52 (setting the standard of review for
â€œ[Factual] Findings and Conclusions by the
Courtâ€ (emphasis added)).

															While we held in Markman that the ultimate issue of the
proper construction of a claim should be treated as a question of
law, we also recognized that in patent construction, subsidiary
factfinding is sometimes necessary. Indeed, we referred to claim
construction as a practice with â€œevidentiary
underpinnings,â€ a practice that
â€œfalls somewhere between a pristine legal
standard and a simple historical fact.â€ 517
U.Â S., at 378, 388, 390. We added that sometimes courts
may have to make â€œcredibility
judgmentsâ€ about witnesses. Id., at 389. In
other words, we recognized that courts may have to resolve
subsidiary factual disputes. And, as explained above, the Rule
requires appellate courts to review all such subsidiary factual
findings under the â€œclearly
erroneousâ€ standard.

															Precedent further supports application of the
â€œclearly erroneousâ€ standard. Before
the creation of the Federal Circuit, the Second Circuit explained
that in claim construction, the subsidiary
â€œquestion .Â .Â . of how
the art un-derstood the term .Â .Â . was
plainly a question of fact; and unless the [district
courtâ€™s] finding was â€˜clearly
erroneous,â€™ we are to takeâ€ it
â€œas controlling.â€ Harries v.
Air King Products, Co., 183 F. 2d 158, 164 (CA2 1950) (L.
Hand, C.Â J.). We have said the same as to subsidiary
factual findings concerning other patent law inquiries, including
â€œobviousness.â€ Dennison Mfg.
Co. v. Panduit Corp.,475 U.Â S. 809,811
(1986) (per curiam) (â€œsubsidiary
determinations of the District Courtâ€ subject to Rule
52(a)â€™s clear error standard).

															Finally, practical considerations favor clear error review. We
have previously pointed out that clear error review is
â€œparticularlyâ€ important where
patent law is at issue because patent law is â€œa
field where so much depends upon familiarity with specific
scientific problems and principles not usually contained in the
general storehouse of knowledge and experience.â€
Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products
Co.,339 U.Â S. 605,610 (1950). A district court
judge who has presided over, and listened to, the entirety of a
proceeding has a comparatively greater opportunity to gain that
familiarity than an appeals court judge who must read a written
transcript or perhaps just those portions to which the parties have
referred. Cf. Lighting Ballast, 744 F. 3d, at 1311
(Oâ€™Malley, J., dissenting) (Federal Circuit
judges â€œlack the tools that district courts have
available to resolve factual disputes fairly and
accurately,â€ such as questioning the experts, examining
the invention in operation, or appointing a court-appointed
expert); Anderson, 470 U.Â S., at 574
(â€œThe trial judgeâ€™s major
role is the determination of fact, and with experience in
fulfilling that role comes expertiseâ€).

															B

															Sandoz argues that claim construction mostly consists of
construing a set of written documents that do not give rise to
subsidiary factual disputes. Tr. of Oral Arg. 39. It adds that
separating â€œfactualâ€ from
â€œlegalâ€ questions is often
difficult. And Sandoz, like the Federal Circuit itself, argues that
it is simpler for that appellate court to review the entirety of
the district courtâ€™s claim construction de
novo rather than to apply two separate standards. Id.,
at 38; see also Lighting Ballast, supra, at 1284
(criticizing clear error review in part because of the purportedly
difficult task of â€œdisentanglingâ€
fact from law).

															But even were we free to ignore the Federal Rule (which we are
not), we would not find this argument convincing. Courts of appeals
have long found it possible to separate factual from legal matters.
See, e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc. v.
Kaplan,514 U.Â S. 938â€“948
(1995) (review of factual findings for clear error and legal
conclusions deÂ novo is the
â€œordinaryâ€ standard for courts of
appeals). At the same time, the Federal
Circuitâ€™s efforts to treat factual findings and
legal conclusions similarly have brought with them their own
complexities. See e.g., Cybor Corp. v. FAS
Technologies, Inc., 138 F. 3d 1448, 1454 (CA Fed. 1998) (en
banc) (claim construction does not involve
â€œfactual evidentiary findingsâ€
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); Lighting
Ballast, supra, at 1284 (claim construction has
â€œarguably factual aspectsâ€); Dow
Jones & Co. v. Ablaise Ltd., 606 F.Â 3d
1338, 1344â€“1345 (CA Fed. 2010)
(â€œ[T]his court,â€ while reviewing
claim construction without deference, â€œtakes
into account the views of the trial judgeâ€); Nazomi
Communications Inc., v. Arm Holdings, PLC, 403 F. 3d
1364, 1371 (CA Fed. 2005) (â€œ[C]ommon sense
dictates that the trial judgeâ€™s view will carry
weightâ€ (citation and internal quotation marks
omitted)); Lightning Ballast, supra, at 1294 (Lourie, J.,
concurring) (we should â€œrarelyâ€
overturn district courtâ€™s true subsidiary
factfinding; â€œwe should, and do, give proper
informal deference to the work of judges of a subordinate
tribunalâ€); Cybor, supra, at 1480
(opinion of Newman, J.) (â€œBy continuing the
fiction that there are no facts to be found in claim
interpretations, we confound rather than ease the litigation
processâ€); see also Anderson, supra, at
575 (the parties â€œhave already been forced to
concentrate their energies and resources on persuading the trial
judge that their account of the facts is the correct one; requiring
them to persuade three more judges at the appellate level is
requiring too muchâ€); Brief for Peter S. Menell et al.
as Amici Curiae 5 (Federal Circuit overturns district court
claim construction at unusually high rate).

															Finally, the Circuit feared that â€œclear
errorâ€ review would bring about less uniformity.
Lighting Ballast, supra, at 1280. Neither the Circuit
nor Sandoz, however, has shown that (or explained why) divergent
claim construction stemming from divergent findings of fact (on
subsidiary matters) should occur more than occasionally. After all,
the Federal Circuit will continue to review de novo the
district courtâ€™s ultimate interpretation of the
patent claims. And the attorneys will no doubt bring cases
construing the same claim to the attention of the trial judge;
those prior cases will sometimes be binding because of issue
preclusion, see Markman, 517 U.Â S., at 391, and
sometimes will serve as persuasive authority. Moreover, it is
always possible to consolidate for discovery different cases that
involve construction of the same claims. And, as we said in
Markman, subsidiary factfinding is unlikely to loom large in
the universe of litigated claim construction. Id., at
389â€“390.

															C

															The dissent argues that claim construction does not involve any
â€œfactfinding,â€ or, if it does, claim
construction factfinding is akin to the factfinding that underlies
our interpretation of statutes. Post, at 1,
5â€“7 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Its first, broader
contention runs contrary to our recognition in Markman that
claim construction has â€œevidentiary
underpinningsâ€ and that courts construing patent claims
must sometimes make â€œcredibility
judgmentsâ€ about witnesses. 517 U.Â S., at
389â€“390. Indeed, as discussed in Part III,
infra, this case provides a perfect example of the
factfinding that sometimes underlies claim construction: The
parties here presented the District Court with competing
fact-related claims by different experts, and the District Court
resolved the issues of fact that divided those experts.

															The dissentâ€™s contention also runs contrary
to Sandozâ€™s concession at oral argument that
claim construction will sometimes require subsidiary factfinding.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 33â€“34,
38â€“40. It is in tension with our interpretation
of related areas of patent law, such as the interpretation of
â€œobviousness,â€ which we have said
involves subsidiary factfinding subject to Rule
52(a)â€™s clear error review. See Dennison,
475 U. S., at 811. And it fights the question presented in this
case, which assumes the existence of such factfinding. See
Pet. for Cert. i (whether â€œa district
courtâ€™s factual finding in support of its
construction of a patent claim term may be reviewed
deÂ novo, . . . or only for clear
errorâ€).

															Neither do we find factfinding in this context sufficiently
similar to the factfinding that underlies statutory interpretation.
Statutes, in general, address themselves to the general public;
patent claims concern a small portion of that public. Statutes
typically (though not always) rest upon congressional consideration
of general facts related to a reasonably broad set of social
circumstances; patents typically (though not always) rest upon
consideration by a few private parties, experts, and administrators
of more narrowly circumscribed facts related to specific technical
matters. The public, and often an adversarial public, typically
considers and discusses the relevant general facts before Congress
enacts a statute; only private parties, experts, and administrators
likely consider the relevant technical facts before the award of a
patent. Given these differences, it is not surprising that this
Court has never previously compared patent claim construction in
any here relevant way to statutory construction. As discussed
supra, at 5, however, the Court has repeatedly compared
patent claim construction to the construction of other written
instruments such as deeds and contracts. See, e.g., Markman,
supra, at 384, 386, 388, 389; Motion Picture Patent
Co., 243 U.Â S., at 510; Goodyear, 102
U.Â S., at 227.

															D

															Now that we have set forth why the Federal Circuit must
apply clear error review when reviewing subsidiary factfinding in
patent claim construction, it is necessary to explain how
the rule must be applied in that context. We recognize that a
district courtâ€™s construction of a patent claim,
like a district courtâ€™s interpretation of a
written instrument, often requires the judge only to examine and to
construe the documentâ€™s words without requiring
the judge to resolve any underlying factual disputes. As all
parties agree, when the district court reviews only evidence
intrinsic to the patent (the patent claims and specifications,
along with the patentâ€™s prosecution history),
the judgeâ€™s determination will amount solely to
a determination of law, and the Court of Appeals will review that
construction de novo. See Brief for Petitioners 27, Re-ply
Brief 16; Brief for Respondents 43; see also Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 12â€“13.

															In some cases, however, the district court will need to look
beyond the patentâ€™s intrinsic evidence and to
consult extrinsic evidence in order to understand, for example, the
background science or the meaning of a term in the relevant art
during the relevant time period. See, e.g., Seymour v.
Osborne, 11 Wall. 516, 546 (1871) (a patent may be
â€œso interspersed with technical terms and terms
of art that the testimony of scientific witnesses is indispensable
to a correct understanding of its meaningâ€). In cases
where those subsidiary facts are in dispute, courts will need to
make subsidiary factual findings about that extrinsic evidence.
These are the â€œevidentiary
underpinningsâ€ of claim construction that we discussed
in Markman, and this subsidiary factfinding must be reviewed
for clear error on appeal.

															For example, if a district court resolves a dispute between
experts and makes a factual finding that, in general, a certain
term of art had a particular meaning to a person of ordinary skill
in the art at the time of the invention, the district court must
then conduct a legal analysis: whether a skilled artisan would
ascribe that same meaning to that term in the context of the
specific patent claim under review. That is because
â€œ[e]xperts may be examined to explain terms of
art, and the state of the art, at any given time,â€ but
they cannot be used to prove â€œthe proper or
legal construction of any instrument of writing.â€
Winans v. New York & Erie R. Co., 21 How. 88,
100â€“101 (1859); see also Markman,
supra, at 388
(â€œÂ â€˜Where
technical terms are used, or where the qualities of substances
.Â .Â . or any similar data necessary to the
comprehension of the language of the patent are unknown to the
judge, the testimony of witnesses may be received upon these
subjects, and any other means of information be employed. But in
the actual interpretation of the patent the court proceeds upon its
own responsibility, as an arbiter of the law, giving to the patent
its true and final character and
forceâ€™Â â€ (quoting 2
W. Robinson, Law of Patents Â§732, pp.
482â€“483 (1890); emphasis in original)).

															Accordingly, the question we have answered here concerns review
of the district courtâ€™s resolution of a
subsidiary factual dispute that helps that court determine the
proper interpretation of the written patent claim. The district
judge, after deciding the factual dispute, will then interpret the
patent claim in light of the facts as he has found them. This
ultimate interpretation is a legal conclusion. The appellate court
can still review the district courtâ€™s ultimate
construction of the claim de novo. But, to overturn the
judgeâ€™s resolution of an underlying factual
dispute, the Court of Appeals must find that the judge, in respect
to those factual findings, has made a clear error. Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 52(a)(6).

															In some instances, a factual finding will play only a small role
in a judgeâ€™s ultimate legal conclusion about the
meaning of the patent term. But in some instances, a factual
finding may be close to dispositive of the ultimate legal question
of the proper meaning of the term in the context of the patent.
Nonetheless, the ultimate question of construction will remain a
legal question. Simply because a factual finding may be nearly
dispositive does not render the subsidiary question a legal one.
â€œ[A]n issue does not lose its factual character
merely because its resolution is dispositive of the
ultimateâ€ legal question. Miller v.
Fenton,474 U.Â S. 104,113 (1985). It is analogous
to a judge (sitting without a jury) deciding whether a defendant
gave a confession voluntarily. The answer to the legal question
about the voluntariness of the confes-sion may turn upon the answer
to a subsidiary factual question, say â€œwhether
in fact the police engaged in the intimidation tactics alleged by
the defendant.â€ Id., at 112. An appellate court
will review the trial judgeâ€™s factual
determination about the alleged intimidation deferentially (though,
after reviewing the factual findings, it will review a
judgeâ€™s ultimate determination of voluntariness
de novo). See id., at 112â€“118. An
appellate court similarly should review for clear error those
factual findings that underlie a district
courtâ€™s claim construction.

															III

															We can illustrate our holding by considering an instance in
which Teva, with the support of the Solicitor General,
argues that the Federal Circuit wrongly reviewed the District
Courtâ€™s factual finding de novo. See
Brief for Petitioners 54â€“56; Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 31â€“32. Recall
that Tevaâ€™s patent claim specifies an active
ingredient with a â€œmolecular weight of about 5
to 9 kilodaltons.â€ Recall Sandozâ€™s
basic argument, namely that the term â€œmolecular
weightâ€ is indefinite or ambiguous. The term might
refer to the weight of the most numerous molecule, it might refer
to weight as calculated by the average weight of all molecules, or
it might refer to weight as calculated by an average in which
heavier molecules count for more. The claim, Sandoz argues, does
not tell us which way we should calculate weight. See Part I,
supra.

															To illustrate, imagine we have a sample of copolymer-1 (the
active ingredient) made up of 10 molecules: 4 weigh 6 kilodaltons
each, 3 weigh 8 kilodaltons each, and 3 weigh 9 kilodaltons each.
Using the first method of calculation, the
â€œmolecular weightâ€ would be 6
kilodaltons, the weight of the most prevalent molecule. Using the
second method, the molecular weight would be 7.5 (total weight, 75,
di-vided by the number of molecules, 10). Using the third method,
the molecular weight would be more than 8, depend-ing upon how much
extra weight we gave to the heavier molecules.

															Teva argued in the District Court that the term
â€œmolecular weightâ€ in the patent
meant molecular weight calculated in the first way (the weight of
the most prevalent molecule, or peak average molecular weight).
Sandoz, however, argued that figure 1 of the patent showed that
Teva could not be right. 810 F.Â Supp. 2d, at 590. (We
have set forth figure 1 in the Appendix, infra). That
figure, said Sandoz, helped to show that the patent term did
not refer to the first method of calculation. Figure 1 shows
how the weights of a sampleâ€™s molecules were
distributed in three different samples. The curves indicate the
number of molecules of each weight that were present in each of the
three. For example, the figureâ€™s legend says
that the first sampleâ€™s
â€œmolecular weightâ€ is 7.7. According
to Teva, that should mean that molecules weighing 7.7 kilodaltons
were the most prevalent molecules in the sample. But, look at the
curve, said Sandoz. It shows that the most prevalent molecule
weighed, not 7.7 kilodaltons, but slightly less than 7.7 (about
6.8) kilodaltons. See App. 138aâ€“139a. After all,
the peak of the first molecular weight distribution curve
(the solid curve in the figure) is not at precisely 7.7
kilodaltons, but at a point just before 7.7. Thus, argued Sandoz,
the figure shows that the patent claim term
â€œmolecular weightâ€ did not mean
molecular weight calculated by the first method. It must mean
something else. It is indefinite. 810 F.Â Supp. 2d, at
590.

															The District Court did not accept Sandozâ€™s
argument. Tevaâ€™s expert testified that a skilled
artisan would understand that converting data from a chromatogram
to molecular weight distribution curves like those in figure 1
would cause the peak on each curve to shift slightly; this could
explain the difference between the value indicated by the peak of
the curve (about 6.8) and the value in the
figureâ€™s legend (7.7). App.
138aâ€“139a. Sandozâ€™s expert
testified that no such shift would occur. App.
375aâ€“376a. The District Court credited
Tevaâ€™s expertâ€™s account,
thereby rejecting Sandozâ€™s
expertâ€™s explanation. 810 F.Â Supp.
2d, at 589; Brief for Respondents 61. The District
Courtâ€™s finding about this matter was a factual
findingâ€”about how a skilled artisan would
understand the way in which a curve created from chromatogram data
reflects molecular weights. Based on that factual finding, the
District Court reached the legal conclusion that figure 1 did not
undermine Tevaâ€™s argument that molecular weight
referred to the first method of calculation (peak average molecular
weight). 810 F.Â Supp. 2d, at
590â€“591.

															When the Federal Circuit reviewed the District
Courtâ€™s decision, it recognized that the peak of
the curve did not match the 7.7 kilodaltons listed in the legend of
figure 1. 723 F.Â 3d, at 1369. But the Federal Circuit
did not accept Tevaâ€™s
expertâ€™s explanation as to how a skilled artisan
would expect the peaks of the curves to shift. And it failed to
accept that explanation without finding that the District
Courtâ€™s contrary determination was
â€œclearly erroneous.â€ See
ibid. The Federal Circuit should have accepted the District
Courtâ€™s finding unless it was
â€œclearly erroneous.â€ Our holding
today makes clear that, in failing to do so, the Federal Circuit
was wrong.

															Teva claims that there are two additional instances in which the
Federal Circuit rejected the District Courtâ€™s
factual findings without concluding that they were clearly
erroneous. We leave these matters for the Federal Circuit to
consider on remand in light of todayâ€™s
opinion.

															We vacate the Federal Circuitâ€™s judgment, and
we remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

															It is so ordered.

solid curve does not correspond precisely to 7.7kDa)
