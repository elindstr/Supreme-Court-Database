															NORTH CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF DENTAL EXAMINERS, PETITIONER
v. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the fourth circuit

															[February 25, 2015]

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join,
dissenting.

															The Courtâ€™s decision in this case is based on
a serious misunderstanding of the doctrine of state-action
antitrust immunity that this Court recognized more than 60 years
ago in Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943).
In Parker, the Court held that the Sherman Act does not
prevent the States from continuing their age-old practice of
enacting measures, such as licensing requirements, that are
designed to protect the public health and welfare. Id., at
352. The case now before us involves precisely this type of state
regulation North Carolinaâ€™s laws governing the
practice of dentistry, which are administered by the North Carolina
Board of Dental Examiners (Board).

															Today, however, the Court takes the unprecedented step of
holding that Parker does not apply to the North Caro-lina
Board because the Board is not structured in a way that merits a
good-government seal of approval; that is, it is made up of
practicing dentists who have a financial incentive to use the
licensing laws to further the financial interests of the
Stateâ€™s dentists. There is nothing new about the
structure of the North Carolina Board. When the States first
created medical and dental boards, well before the Sherman Act was
enacted, they began to staffthem in this way.[1]
Nor is there anything new about the suspicion that the North
Carolina Boardâ€”in attempting to prevent persons
other than dentists from performing teeth-whitening
proceduresâ€”was serving the interests of dentists
and not the public. Professional and occupational licensing
requirements have often been used in such a way.[2] But that is not what Parker immunity is about.
Indeed, the very state program involved in that case was
unquestionably designed to benefit the regulated entities,
California raisin growers.

															The question before us is not whether such programs serve the
public interest. The question, instead, is whether this case is
controlled by Parker, and the answer to that question is
clear. Under Parker, the Sherman Act (and the Federal Trade
Commission Act, see FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.,504
U.Â S. 621,635 (1992)) do not apply to state agencies;
the North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners is a state agency; and
that is the end of the matter. By straying from this simple path,
the Court has not only distorted Parker; it has headed into
a morass. Determining whether a state agency is structured in a way
that militates against regulatory capture is no easy task, and
there is reason to fear that todayâ€™s decision
will spawn confusion. The Court has veered off course, and
therefore I cannot go along.

															I

															In order to understand the nature of Parker state-action
immunity, it is helpful to recall the constitutional landscape in
1890 when the Sherman Act was enacted. At that time, this Court and
Congress had an understanding of the scope of federal and state
power that is very different from our understanding today. The
States were understood to possess the exclusive authority to
regulate â€œtheir purely internal
affairs.â€ Leisy v. Hardin,135
U.Â S. 100,122 (1890). In exercising their police power
in this area, the States had long enacted measures, such as price
controls and licensing requirements, that had the effect of
restraining trade.[3]

															The Sherman Act was enacted pursuant to
Congressâ€™ power to regulate interstate commerce,
and in passing the Act, Congress wanted to exercise that power
â€œto the utmost extent.â€ United
States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn.,322
U.Â S. 533,558 (1944). But in 1890, the understanding of
the commerce power was far more limited than it is today. See,
e.g., Kidd v. Pearson,128 U.Â S.
1â€“18 (1888). As a result, the Act did not pose a
threat to traditional state regulatory activity.

															By 1943, when Parker was decided, however, the situation
had changed dramatically. This Court had held that the commerce
power permitted Congress to regulate even local activity if it
â€œexerts a substantial economic effect on
interstate commerce.â€ Wickard v.
Filburn,317 U.Â S. 111,125 (1942). This meant
that Congress could regulate many of the matters that had once been
thought to fall exclusively within the jurisdiction of the States.
The new interpretation of the commerce power brought about an
expansion of the reach of the Sherman Act. See HospitalBuilding
Co. v. Trustees of Rex Hospital,425 U.Â S.
738,743, n.2 (1976) (â€œ[D]ecisions by this Court
have permitted the reach of the Sherman Act to expand along with
expanding notions of congressional powerâ€). And the
expanded reach of the Sherman Act raised an important question. The
Sherman Act does not expressly exempt States from its scope. Does
that mean that the Act applies to the States and that it
potentially outlaws many traditional state regulatory measures? The
Court confronted that question in Parker.

															In Parker, a raisin producer challenged the California
Agricultural Prorate Act, an agricultural price support program.
The California Act authorized the creation of an Agricultural
Prorate Advisory Commission (Commission) to establish marketing
plans for certain agricultural commodities within the State. 317
U.Â S., at 346â€“347. Raisins were
among the regulated commodities, and so the Commission established
a marketing program that governed many aspects of raisin sales,
including the quality and quantity of raisins sold, the timing of
sales, and the price at which raisins were sold. Id., at
347â€“348. The Parker Court assumed that
this program would have violated â€œthe Sherman
Act if it were organized and made effective solely by virtue of a
contract, combination or conspiracy of private
persons,â€ and the Court also assumed that Congress
could have prohibited a State from creating a program like
Californiaâ€™s if it had chosen to do so.
Id., at 350. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that the
California program did not violate the Sherman Act because the Act
did not circumscribe state regulatory power. Id., at
351.

															The Courtâ€™s holding in Parker was not
based on either the language of the Sherman Act or anything in the
legislative history affirmatively showing that the Act was not
meant to apply to the States. Instead, the Court reasoned that
â€œ[i]n a dual system of government in which,
under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as
Con-gress may constitutionally subtract from their authority, an
unexpressed purpose to nullify a stateâ€™s control
over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to
Congress.â€ 317 U.Â S., at 351. For the
Congress that enacted the Sherman Act in 1890, it would have been a
truly radical and almost certainly futile step to attempt to
prevent the States from exercising their traditional regulatory
authority, and the Parker Court refused to assume that the
Act was meant to have such an effect.

															When the basis for the Parker state-action doctrine is
understood, the Courtâ€™s error in this case is
plain. In 1890, the regulation of the practice of medicine and
dentistry was regarded as falling squarely within the
Statesâ€™ sovereign police power. By that time,
many States had established medical and dental boards, often
staffed by doctors or dentists,[4] and had given
those boards the authority to confer and revoke licenses.[5] This was quintessential police power legislation, and
although state laws were often challenged during that era under the
doctrine of substantive due process, the licensing of medical
professionals easily survived such assaults. Just one year before
the enactment of the Sherman Act, in Dent v. West
Vir-ginia,129 U.Â S. 114,128 (1889), this Court
rejected such a challenge to a state law requiring all physicians
to obtain a certificate from the state board of health attesting to
their qualifications. And in Hawker v. New York,170
U.Â S. 189,192 (1898), the Court reiterated that a
lawspecifying the qualifications to practice medicine was clearly a
proper exercise of the police power. Thus, the North Carolina
statutes establishing and specifying the powers of the State Board
of Dental Examiners represent precisely the kind of state
regulation that the Parker exemption was meant to
immunize.

															II

															As noted above, the only question in this case is whether the
North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners is really a state agency,
and the answer to that question is clearly yes.

															The North Carolina Legislature determined that the practice of
dentistry â€œaffect[s] the public health, safety
and welfareâ€ of North Carolinaâ€™s
citizens and that therefore the profession should be
â€œsubject to regulation and control in the public
interestâ€ in order to ensure â€œthat
only qualified persons be permitted to practice dentistry in the
State.â€ N.Â C. Gen. Stat. Ann.
Â§90â€“22(a) (2013).

															To further that end, the legislature created the North Carolina
State Board of Dental Examiners â€œas the agency
of the State for the regulation of the practice of dentistry in
th[e] State.â€
Â§90â€“22(b).

															The legislature specified the membership of the Board.
Â§90â€“22(c). It defined the
â€œpractice of dentistry,â€
Â§90â€“29(b), and it set out standards
for licensing practitioners, Â§90â€“30.
The legislature also set out standards under which the Board can
initiate disciplinary proceedings against licensees who engage in
certain improper acts.
Â§90â€“41(a).

															The legislature empowered the Board to
â€œmaintain an action in the name of the State of
North Carolina to perpetually enjoin any person from
.Â .Â . unlawfully practicing
dentistry.â€ Â§90â€“40.1(a).
It authorized the Board to conduct investigations and to hire
legalcounsel, and the legislature made any
â€œnotice or statement of charges against any
licenseeâ€ a public record under state law.
Â§Â§
90â€“41(d)â€“(g).

															The legislature empowered the Board â€œto enact
rules and regulations governing the practice of dentistry within
the State,â€ consistent with relevant statutes.
Â§90â€“48. It has required that any
such rules be included in the Boardâ€™s annual
report, which the Board must file with the North Carolina secretary
of state, the state attorney general, and the
legislatureâ€™s Joint Regulatory Reform Committee.
Â§93Bâ€“2. And if the Board fails to
file the required report, state law demands that it be
automatically suspended until it does so. Ibid.

															As this regulatory regime demonstrates, North
Caro-linaâ€™s Board of Dental Examiners is
unmistakably a state agency created by the state legislature to
serve a prescribed regulatory purpose and to do so using the
Stateâ€™s power in cooperation with other arms of
state government.

															The Board is not a private or
â€œnonsovereignâ€ entity that the State
of North Carolina has attempted to immunize from federal antitrust
scrutiny. Parker made it clear that a State may not
â€œÂ â€˜give immunity
to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate
it, or by declaring that their action is
lawful.â€™Â â€ Ante,
at 7 (quoting Parker, 317 U.Â S., at 351). When
the Parker Court disapproved of any such attempt, it cited
Northern Securities Co. v. United States,193
U.Â S. 197 (1904), to show what it had in mind. In that
case, the Court held that a Stateâ€™s act of
chartering a corporation did not shield the
corporationâ€™s monopolizing activities from
federal antitrust law. Id., at 344â€“345.
Nothing similar is involved here. North Carolina did not authorize
a private entity to enter into an anticompetitive arrangement;
rather, North Carolina created a state agency and gave that
agency the power to regulate a particular subject affecting public
health andsafety.

															Nothing in Parker supports the type of inquiry that the
Court now prescribes. The Court crafts a test under which state
agencies that are â€œcontrolled by active market
participants,â€ ante, at 12, must demonstrate
active state supervision in order to be immune from federal
antitrust law. The Court thus treats these state agencies like
private entities. But in Parker, the Court did not examine
the structure of the California program to determine if it had been
captured by private interests. If the Court had done so, the case
would certainly have come out differently, because California
conditioned its regulatory measures on the participation and
approval of market actors in the relevant industry.

															Establishing a prorate marketing plan under
Californiaâ€™s law first required the petition of
at least 10 producers of the particular commodity. Parker,
317 U.Â S., at 346. If the Commission then agreed that a
marketing plan was warranted, the Commission would
â€œselect a program committee from among
nominees chosen by the qualified producers.â€
Ibid. (emphasis added). That committee would then formulate
the proration marketing program, which the Commission could modify
or approve. But even after Commission approval, the program became
law (and then, automatically) only if it gained the approval of 65
percent of the relevant producers, representing at least 51 percent
of the acreage of the regulated crop. Id., at 347. This
scheme gave decisive power to market participants. But despite
these aspects of the California program, Parker held that
California was acting as a
â€œsovereignâ€ when it
â€œadopt[ed] and enforc[ed] the prorate
program.â€ Id., at 352. This reasoning is
irreconcilable with the Courtâ€™s today.

															III

															The Court goes astray because it forgets the origin of
theParker doctrine and is misdirected by subsequent cases
that extended that doctrine (in certain circumstances) to private
entities. The Court requires the North Carolina Board to satisfy
the two-part test set out in California Retail Liquor Dealers
Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.,445 U.Â S. 97
(1980), but the party claiming Parker immunity in that case
was not a state agency but a private trade association. Such an
entity is entitled to Parker immunity, Midcal held,
only if the anticompetitive conduct at issue was both
â€œÂ â€˜clearly
articulatedâ€™Â â€ and
â€œÂ â€˜actively
supervised by the State
itself.â€™Â â€ 445
U.Â S., at 105. Those requirements are needed where a
State authorizes private parties to engage in anticompetitive
conduct. They serve to identify those situations in which conduct
by private parties can be regarded as the conduct of a
State. But when the conduct in question is the conduct of a state
agency, no such inquiry is required.

															This case falls into the latter category, and therefore
Midcal is inapposite. The North Carolina Board is not a
private trade association. It is a state agency, created and
empowered by the State to regulate an industry affecting public
health. It would not exist if the State had not created it. And for
purposes of Parker, its membership is irrelevant; what
matters is that it is part of the government of the sovereign State
of North Carolina.

															Our decision in Hallie v. Eau Claire,471
U.Â S. 34 (1985), which involved Sherman Act claims
against a municipal-ity, not a State agency, is similarly
inapplicable. In Hallie, the plaintiff argued that the
two-pronged Midcal test should be applied, but the Court
disagreed. The Court acknowledged that municipalities
â€œare not themselves sovereign.â€ 471
U.Â S., at 38. But recognizing that a municipality is
â€œan arm of the State,â€ id.,
at 45, the Court held that a municipality should be required to
satisfy only the first prong of the Midcal test (requiring a
clearly articulated state policy), 471 U.Â S., at 46.
That municipalitiesare not sovereign was critical to our analysis
in Hallie, and thus that decision has no application in a
case, like this one, involving a state agency.

															Here, however, the Court not only disregards the North Carolina
Boardâ€™s status as a full-fledged state agency;
it treats the Board less favorably than a municipality. This is
puzzling. States are sovereign, Northern Ins. Co. of
N.Â Y. v. Chatham County,547
U.Â S. 189,193 (2006), and
Californiaâ€™s sovereignty provided the foundation
for the decision in Parker, supra, at 352.
Municipalities are not sovereign. Jinks v. Richland
County,538 U.Â S. 456,466 (2003). And for this
reason, federal law often treats municipalities differently from
States. Compare Will v. Michigan Dept. of State
Police,491 U.Â S. 58,71 (1989)
(â€œ[N]either a State nor its officials acting it
their official capacities are
â€˜personsâ€™ under [42
U.Â S.Â C.] Â§1983â€),
with Monell v. City Dept. of Social Servs., New
York,436 U.Â S. 658,694 (1978) (municipalities
liable under Â§1983 where â€œexecution
of a governmentâ€™s policy or custom
.Â .Â . inflicts the
injuryâ€).

															The Court recognizes that municipalities, although not
sovereign, nevertheless benefit from a more lenient standard for
state-action immunity than private entities. Yet under the
Courtâ€™s approach, the North Carolina Board of
Dental Examiners, a full-fledged state agency, is treated like a
private actor and must demonstrate that the State actively
supervises its actions.

															The Courtâ€™s analysis seems to be predicated
on an assessment of the varying degrees to which a municipality and
a state agency like the North Carolina Board are likely to be
captured by private interests. But until today, Parker
immunity was never conditioned on the proper use of state
regulatory authority. On the contrary, in Columbia v.
Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc.,499 U.Â S.
365 (1991), we refused to recognize an exception to Parker
for cases in which it was shown that the defendants hadengaged in a
conspiracy or corruption or had acted in a way that was not in the
public interest. Id., at 374. The Sherman Act, we said, is
not an anticorruption or good-government statute. 499
U.Â S., at 398. We were unwilling in Omni to
rewrite Parker in order to reach the allegedly abusive
behavior of city officials. 499 U.Â S., at
374â€“379. But that is essentially what the Court
has done here.

															III

															Not only is the Courtâ€™s decision inconsistent
with the underlying theory of Parker; it will create
practical problems and is likely to have far-reaching effects on
the Statesâ€™ regulation of professions. As
previously noted, state medical and dental boards have been staffed
by practitioners since they were first created, and there are
obvious advantages to this approach. It is reasonable for States to
decide that the individuals best able to regulate technical
professions are practitioners with expertise in those very
professions. Staffing the State Board of Dental Examiners with
certified public accountants would certainly lessen the risk of
actions that place the well-being of dentists over those of the
public, but this would also compromise the
Stateâ€™s interest in sensibly regulating a
technical profession in which lay people have little expertise.

															As a result of todayâ€™s decision, States may
find it necessary to change the composition of medical, dental, and
other boards, but it is not clear what sort of changes are needed
to satisfy the test that the Court now adopts. The Court faults the
structure of the North Carolina Board because
â€œactive market participantsâ€
constitute â€œa controlling number of [the]
decisionmakers,â€ ante, at 14, but this test
raises many questions.

															What is a â€œcontrolling numberâ€?
Is it a majority? And if so, why does the Court eschew that term?
Or does the Court mean to leave open the possibility that something
less than a majority might suffice in particular circum-stances?
Suppose that active market participants constitute a voting bloc
that is generally able to get its way? How about an obstructionist
minority or an agency chair empowered to set the agenda or veto
regulations?

															Who is an â€œactive market
participantâ€? If Board members withdraw from practice
during a short term of service but typically return to practice
when their terms end, does that mean that they are not active
market participants during their period of service?

															What is the scope of the market in which a member may not
participate while serving on the board? Must the market be relevant
to the particular regulation being challenged or merely to the
jurisdiction of the entire agency? Would the result in the present
case be different if amajority of the Board members, though
practicing dentists, did not provide teeth whitening services? What
if they were orthodontists, periodontists, and the like? And how
much participation makes a person
â€œactiveâ€ in the market?

															The answers to these questions are not obvious, but the States
must predict the answers in order to make informed choices about
how to constitute their agencies.

															I suppose that all this will be worked out by the lower courts
and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), but the
Courtâ€™s approach raises a more fundamental
question, and that is why the Courtâ€™s inquiry
should stop with an examination of the structure of a state
licensing board. When the Court asks whether market participants
control the North Carolina Board, the Court in essence is asking
whether this regulatory body has been captured by the entities that
it is supposed to regulate. Regulatory capture can occur in many
ways.[6] So why ask only whetherthe members of a
board are active market participants? The answer may be that
determining when regulatory capture has occurred is no simple task.
That answer provides a reason for relieving courts from the
obligation to make such determinations at all. It does not explain
why it is appropriate for the Court to adopt the rather crude test
for capture that constitutes the holding of
todayâ€™s decision.

															IV

															The Court has created a new standard for distinguishing between
private and state actors for purposes of fed-eral antitrust
immunity. This new standard is not true to the Parker
doctrine; it diminishes our traditional respect for federalism and
state sovereignty; and it will be difficult to apply. I therefore
respectfully dissent.
