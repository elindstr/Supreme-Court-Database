															TAE D. JOHNSON, ACTING DIRECTOR OF U. S. IMMI-GRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT, et al., PETITIONERS v. MARIA ANGELICA GUZMAN CHAVEZ, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 29, 2021]

															

															Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.

															Respondents in this case are noncitizens previously ordered removed from the United States.  After leaving the United States, each of them later returned (illegally).  The Government then reinstated their original removal orders.  See

8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(5).  Each of the respondents argued to immigration authorities that the Government could not remove them because they reasonably feared persecution or torture in the country to which the Government sought to send them.  And pursuant to the United States’ international commitments, the immigration authorities began the process of determining whether the Government should grant withholding-only relief (the withholding or deferral of removal).  See §1231(b)(3)(A); 8 CFR §§208.16–208.18, 208.31, 241.8(e), 1208.16–1208.18, 1208.31, 1241.8(e) (2020).

															The question in this case is whether respondents are entitled to a bond hearing while immigration authorities engage in the lengthy process of determining whether respondents have the legal right (because of their fear of persecution or torture) to have their removal withheld.  The Court points to two statutory provisions that might answer that question.  The first, §1226, is a more general provision governing detention, and favors respondents.  It says that “pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States,”

8 U. S. C. §1226(a), the Government “may release the alien on . . . bond” or “conditional parole.”  §§1226(a)(2)(A), (B); see also 8 CFR §§236.1(c)(8), 1236.1(c)(8) (authorizing parole where the alien has demonstrated that “such release would not pose a danger to property or persons” and he or she “is likely to appear for any future proceeding”).  The second, §1231, is a provision that more specifically applies to “aliens ordered removed,” and can be read to favor the Government because it does not expressly provide for a bond hearing during what it calls the 90-day “removal period.”

8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(2); see also 8 CFR §241.13(b)(2)(ii).  The Government claims that §1231 applies to respondents and allows the Government to deny them bond hearings while their withholding-only relief proceedings take place.

															The Court agrees with the Government.  In its view, respondents’ circumstances fall within the scope of what §1231 calls a “removal period.”  §§1231(a)(1)(A)–(B).  And it believes that section implicitly allows the Government to deny bond hearings during the 90-day removal period.  See ante, at 7–8; §1231(a)(2).  I agree that we have jurisdiction to review the decision below.  See ante, at 8, n. 4; see also Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 30–31).  In my view, however, respondents do not fall within the scope of §1231.  Hence, §1231 does not apply.  Rather, respondents’ circumstances are governed by the more general section that concerns the conditions of detention pending a final determination on removal.  See §1226.  And they are entitled to the bond hearings for which that general section provides.  See §1226(a)(2).

															I

															Readers should keep in mind two subsections of §1231’s relevant statutory text.  The first subsection at issue makes clear what §1231 is about, namely, a “removal period.”  It then sets forth a general rule.  It says:

															“(1) Removal period

															“(A) In general

															“Except as otherwise provided in this section, when an alien is ordered removed, the Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days (in this section referred to as the ‘removal period’).”

8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(1)(A).

															(Readers should also note that while many of the provisions at issue here refer to the “Attorney General,” Congress has elsewhere transferred enforcement of some of those provisions to the Secretary of Homeland Security.  See Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2019) (slip op., at 3, n. 2).)  The second subsection sets forth a restriction on removal (the restriction-on-removal provision), an exception to the general rule.  It says:

															“(3) Restriction on removal to a country where alien’s life or freedom would be threatened

															“(A) In general

															“[T]he Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien’s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien’s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”  §1231(b)(3)(A).

															This restriction on removal when an alien fears persecution or torture embodies an important international legal obligation that the United States has undertaken.  See Refugee Act of 1980,

94Stat.
107, codified in part at 8 U. S. C. §1231(b)(3); see also Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Art. 1, §1, Jan. 31, 1967, 19 U. S. T. 6223, 6225, T. I. A. S. No. 6577 (United States acceding to Articles 2 through 34 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Art. 33(1), July 28, 1951, 189 U. N. T. S. 150).  The United States also follows a policy that withholds or defers removal “of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.”  §2242,

112Stat.
2681–822, note following

8 U. S. C. §1231, p. 844; 8 CFR §§208.16–208.18 (implementing the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100–20, 1465 U. N. T. S. 85).  These policy commitments, embodied in §1231’s restriction-on-removal provision, apply to any alien ordered removed, including respondents, who are entitled to ask for withholding-only relief.  See Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales,

548 U.S. 30, 35, n. 4 (2006); 8 CFR §§208.31, 241.8(e), 1208.31, 1241.8(e).

															A

															The procedures to determine whether an alien qualifies for withholding-only relief are complex.  Any alien, including one “whose removal is reinstated” under

8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(5), must be afforded the opportunity to “expres[s] a fear of returning to the country of removal” specified in the order of removal.  8 CFR §208.31(a) (boldface omitted).  An asylum officer will then interview the individual to determine whether that individual “has a reasonable fear of persecution or torture.”  §208.31(c).  (Asylum officers found that each respondent here has a “reasonable fear.”  Romero v. Evans, 280 F. Supp. 3d 835, 837 (ED Va. 2017).)  If so, an immigration judge will “full[y] conside[r] . . . the request for withholding of removal only.”  §§208.31(e); 1208.31(e).  If the immigration judge denies the claim, the alien can appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and, as applicable, seek judicial review.  §§208.31(e), (g), 1208.31(e), (g); 8 U. S. C. §§1252(a)(1), (4).

															Studies have found that this procedure often takes over a year, with some proceedings lasting well over two years before eligibility for withholding-only relief is resolved.  See Hausman, ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, Fact-Sheet: Withholding-Only Cases and Detention 2 (Apr.  19, 2015), https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/withholding_only_fact_sheet_-_final.pdf (finding an average length of detention of 114 days when neither party appealed the immigration judge’s final decision, 301 days when at least one party appealed and the BIA rendered a final decision, and 447 days when the BIA remanded the case and the immigration judge made a final decision); see also, e.g., Martinez v. Larose, 968 F.3d 555, 558 (CA6 2020) (alien detained for over 28 months while awaiting withholding-only relief eligibility determination).

															Studies have also found that, once withholding-only relief is granted, the alien is ordinarily not sent to another, less dangerous country.  Rather, the alien typically remains in the United States for the foreseeable future.  See Brief for Respondents 6 (noting only 1.6% of noncitizens granted withholding-only relief were ever actually removed to an alternative country (citing American Immigration Council & National Immigrant Justice Center, The Difference Between Asylum and Withholding of Removal 7 (Oct. 2020), https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/sites/default/files/research/the_difference_between_asylum_and_withholding_of_removal.pdf )).

															These figures—particularly the length of time needed to complete the related administrative proceedings—raise an obvious question.  Typically, Congress permits aliens initially placed in removal proceedings to apply for bond (while such proceedings transpire).  See

8 U. S. C. §1226(a)(2).  That makes sense.  A bond hearing does not mean an alien will run away.  Bond is normally granted only if the immigration judge has assurance that the alien will not abscond and is instead “likely to appear for any future proceeding.”  8 CFR §§236.1(c)(8), 1236.1(c)(8).  And an alien’s release from detention during such proceedings may have collateral effects.  See Katzmann, When Legal Representation Is Deficient: The Challenge of Immigration Cases for the Courts, 143 Daedalus 37, 43–44 (2014) (describing how those detained during removal proceedings are less likely to achieve the outcomes they seek).

															I can understand why Congress might not want to grant a bond hearing to an alien whose circumstances fall within the removal period.  That period, after all, should normally be brief.  The statute says “90 days.”

8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(1)(A).  But why would Congress want to deny a bond hearing to individuals who reasonably fear persecution or torture, and who, as a result, face proceedings that may last for many months or years (while their withholding-only proceedings wend their way toward completion)?  I can find no satisfactory answer to this question.

															B

															Does the statutory provision’s language nonetheless require the majority’s result?  In my view, it does not.  Reread the first seven words of that provision’s general rule.  They say that the provision’s removal rules apply “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section.”  §1231(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  And later in the same section, following that “except clause,” the restriction-on-removal provision says that “the Attorney General may not remove” an alien who falls within its terms.  §1231(b)(3)(A) (emphasis added); see also note following §1231, at 884.  Why does that provision, then, not count as what the general statutory rule calls an “except[ion]?”

															Read on.  Following the “general” terms governing the removal period rule, §1231 says:

															“(B) Beginning of Period

															“The removal period begins on the latest of the following:

															“(i) The date the order of removal becomes administratively final.

															“(ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of the court’s final order.

															“(iii) If the alien is detained or confined . . . , the date the alien is released from detention or confinement.”  §1231(a)(1) (emphasis added).

															No one here claims that §1231 authorizes detention without a bond hearing before the removal period begins.  And the most natural reading of the italicized language should lead to the conclusion that the removal period has not yet begun.  The removal period does not commence until the administrative proceedings are over, i.e., until “the order of removal” is “administratively final.”  And the order is not “final” until the immigration judge and the BIA finally determine whether the restriction on removal applies and prohibits removal (unless and until the Government can identify a willing alternative receiving country).

															II

															A

															The majority believes we must read the statute differently.  It reads the “except clause” as serving only to extend the “length of the removal period,” ante, at 16–17, not to exempt the removal procedures altogether.  In its view, the time during which respondents seek administrative relief from the order of removal due to a reasonable fear of persecution or torture nevertheless remains within the “removal period,” which the restriction-on-removal provision simply extends.  (And, as I said, the majority assumes that §1231 allows the Government to deny bond hearings during the 90-day “removal period.”)

															While this is a possible reading, it is not what the statute actually says.  The statute begins with the phrase “except as otherwise provided in this section,” and it follows that clause with basic operative language, namely, “the Attorney General shall remove the alien.”  §1231(a)(1)(A).  It does not say, “within a period of 90 days except if this section provides for a longer period.”  The majority’s interpretation is an awkward way to read that sentence.

															The majority then points to three statutory phrases to which it believes the “except clause” applies.  Those phrases, it says, are evidence that the “except clause” simply instructs that “the removal period may be extended” for three reasons.  Ante, at 3.  The first provision, plainly titled “Suspension of period,” “extend[s]” the “removal period . . . beyond a period of 90 days” if the alien, for example, fails to seek appropriate travel documents.  §1231(a)(1)(C) (boldface omitted).  A second provision allows the Government to “detai[n ] beyond the removal period” individuals who have committed certain serious crimes or pose “a risk to the community or [are] unlikely to comply with the order of removal.”  §1231(a)(6).  And a third allows the Government to “stay the removal of an alien” if “immediate removal is not practicable or proper” or the alien is “needed to testify” in a prosecution.  §§1231(c)(2)(A)(i), (ii).

															The third example, however, is beside the point, for it comes equipped with its own bond and supervised released possibility, staying (rather than extending) the removal period.  See §1231(c)(2)(C); 8 CFR §241.6(a).  The first two examples are unlike the restriction-on-removal provision in that their language simply suggests, not invalidation of the removal order’s identified country of removal, but an extension of the removal period beyond 90 days.  See

8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(1)(C) (“exten[d] beyond a period of 90 days”); §1231(a)(6) (“detai[n] beyond the removal period”).  The restriction-on-removal provision contains no such language.  I add that the majority’s exceptions, unlike the restriction-on-removal provision, typically do not entail proceedings that last (and keep the alien in the United States) for many months or years.  Nor do they call into question whether the removal order will ultimately be implemented.  These inconsistencies suggest the “except clause” does more than merely extend the 90-day limit.

															B

															The majority’s interpretation of the words “administratively final” is no more convincing.  The majority says that these words apply only to the finality of the original removal orders, i.e., the orders issued before respondents left the country and returned, as of the time those orders were first issued.  After all, the majority adds, see ante, at 9–10, a further subsection of §1231 says that “the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, [and] the alien . . . may not apply for any relief under this chapter.”  §1231(a)(5).

															This last mentioned provision, however, is not relevant here.  It cannot prevent an alien from seeking what is in effect a modification of, a change in, or a withholding of, the “prior order of removal” for reasons of fear of persecution or torture.  After all, §1231(b)(3)(A) says the contrary.  Government practice is also to the contrary.  See note following §1231, at 884; 8 CFR §§208.31, 241.8(e), 1208.31, 1241.8(e).  And all here agree that the aliens are legally entitled to seek that withholding-only relief.  See Fernandez-Vargas, 548 U. S., at 35, n. 4.

															Now consider the temporal problem.  The time when the majority says the reinstated removal order became “administratively final” is the time at which the original order of removal became final.  But to take the words “administratively final” as referring only to that time would lead to a very peculiar statute.  It means that most reinstated removal orders will have become administratively final many years before the proceedings during which they are reinstated.  Recall that in most instances the 90-day removal period begins when the removal order becomes administratively final.  If the majority is right, in the case of most respondents, the 90-day removal period began long before the aliens left the country, let alone returned.  Did the 90-day removal period begin to run at that earlier time?  Did it run and then terminate?  Is there now no removal period?  Read as the majority does, the 90-day limit that governs all of §1231 would not apply at all to aliens in respondents’ circumstances.

															For this reason, I believe the better reading of those words would be to apply them to any removal orders, reinstated or not, that are not yet “administratively final.”  And here, the orders are not final until the administrative proceedings (concerning eligibility for withholding-only relief on account of fear of persecution or torture) are complete.  Cf. Bennett v. Spear,

520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (agency action is not “final” until, inter alia, all “rights or obligations have been determined . . . from which legal consequences will flow” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

															*  *  *

															In sum, I can find no good reason why Congress would have wanted categorically to deny bond hearings to those who, like respondents, seek to have removal withheld or deferred due to a reasonable fear of persecution or torture.  And I do not agree with the majority’s reading of the statute’s language as denying them that opportunity.  If, as I believe, §1231 does not apply to the withholding-only relief proceedings before us, then, as the majority concedes, see ante, at 1, §1226 applies, and grants them bond hearings.  I would apply that provision and afford respondents bond hearings.

															With respect, I dissent.
