U.S. Supreme Court NEW YORK v. CONNECTICUT, 4 U.S. 6 (1799) Â 4 U.S. 6 (Dall.)  The State of New York v. The State of Connecticut et al. *  August Term, 1799  AS the state of Connecticut did not appear, Hoffman moved that she should appear on the first day of next term, or that the plaintiff be then at liberty to proceed ex parte. 3 Dal. 335. But Lewis observed, that the rule required that a subpoena issuing in a suit in equity, should be served sixty days before the return; which had not been done in the present case. The first motion was, thereupon, waived; and an alias subpoena awarded. 3 Dall. 320. Footnotes [Footnote *] See same cause at 4 U.S. 1, 4 Dall. 1.[ New York v. Connecticut Footnote 4 U.S. 6 (1799) ]
