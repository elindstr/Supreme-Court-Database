															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–806

															_________________

															HEALTH AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF MARION
COUNTY, et al., PETITIONERS v. IVANKA TALEVSKI, as
personal representative of the ESTATE OF GORGI TALEVSKI,
DECEASED

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 8, 2023]

															Justice Gorsuch, concurring.

															Section 1983 permits individuals to sue to
vindicate their “rights . . . secured by
. . . la[w].” Rev. Stat. §1979, 42
U. S. C. §1983. I agree with the Court’s
disposition of the two questions we took this case to decide and in
arriving there largely track Justice Barrett’s reasoning.
First, the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act qualifies as a
“law” for purposes of §1983. Post, at 1
(Barrett, J., concurring). Second, the text of the Act’s
operative provisions refers to individual “rights.”
Post, at 2–4 (same). But, to my mind, there are other
issues lurking here that petitioners failed to develop
fully—whether legal rights provided for in spending power
legislation like the Act are “secured” as against
States in particular and whether they may be so secured consistent
with the Constitution’s anti-commandeering principle. See,
e.g., National Federation of Independent Business v.
Sebelius, 567 U.S.
519, 575–578 (2012); Murphy v. National
Collegiate Athletic Assn., 584 U. S. ___, ___–___
(2018) (slip op., at 14–18). As I see it, those are questions
for another day.
