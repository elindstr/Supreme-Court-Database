															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															BENJAMIN ROBERS, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[May 5, 2014]

															

															     Justice Sotomayor,
with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.

															     I join the opinion of
the Court. I write separately, however, to clarify that I see its
analysis as applying only in cases where a victim intends to sell
collateral but encounters a reasonable delay in doing so. See ante,
at 5–6 (explaining that where a victim “does not intend
to sell” collateral, “other provisions of the statute
may come into play,” enabling a court “to count, as
part of the restitution paid, the value of collateral previously
received but not sold”). If a victim chooses to hold
collateral rather than to reduce it to cash within a reasonable
time, then the victim must bear the risk of any subsequent decline
in the value of the collateral, because the defendant is not the
proximate cause of that decline.

															     Here, although the
banks did not immediately sell the homes they received as
collateral, Robers did not adequately argue below that their delay
reflected a choice to hold the homes as investments.[1]* Such an argument would likely have been
fruitless, because the delay appears consistent with a genuine
desire to dispose of the collateral. Real property is not a liquid
asset, which means that converting it to cash often takes time.
See, e.g., 698 F. 3d 937, 947 (CA7 2012) (“[R]eal
property is not liquid and, absent a huge price discount, cannot be
sold immediately”). And indeed, the delays here appear to
have resultedfrom illiquidity. See App. 70 (one of the two homes
was placed on the market but did not immediately sell); id., at 89
(the other attracted no bids at a foreclosure sale). Because such
delays are foreseeable, it is fair for Robers to bear their cost:
the diminution in the homes’ value. See ante, at 6 (analysis
of proximate causation).

															     In other cases,
however, a defendant might be able to show that a significant delay
in the sale of collateral evinced the victim’s choice to hold
it as an investment rather than reducing it to cash. Suppose, for
example, that a bank received shares of a public company as
collateral for a fraudulently obtained loan. “Common stock
traded on a national exchange is . . . readily
convertible into cash,” Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494
U. S. 56, 69 (1990) , so if the bank waited more than a
reasonable time to sell the shares, a district court could infer
that the bank was not really trying to sell but instead was holding
the shares as investment assets. If the shares declined in value
after the bank chose to hold them, it would be wrong for the court
to make the defendant bear that loss. As the Government
acknowledged at oral argument, a victim’s choice to hold
collateral—rather than selling it in a reasonably expeditious
manner—breaks the chain of proximate causation. See, e.g.,
Tr. of Oral Arg. 38–39, 44–45. If the collateral loses
value after the victim chooses to hold it, then that “part of
the victim’s net los[s]” is “attributable
to” the victim’s “independent decisions.”
Id., at 39. The defendant cannot be regarded as the
“proximate cause” of that part of the loss, ibid., and
so cannot be made to bear it.

															     In such cases, I would
place on the defendant the burden to show—with evidence
specific to the market at issue—that a victim delayed
unreasonably in selling collateral, manifesting a choice to hold
the collateral. See 18 U. S. C. §3664(e) (burden to
be allocated “as justice requires”). Because Robers did
not sufficiently argue below that the banks broke the chain of
proximate causation by choosing to hold the homes as investments,
and because the delay encountered by the banks appears to have been
reasonable, it is fair for Robers to bear the cost of that delay. I
therefore join the Court in affirming the restitution order.

Notes
1
* Before the District
Court, Robers suggested precisely the opposite: that the banks had
sold the homes too hastily, at fire-sale prices in a falling
market. See App. 35 (“The drop in value could have been due
to the housing market itself, or due to the victim’s rush to
cut their losses with the properties and take whatever price they
could get at a sheriff’s sale, regardless of whether the sale
price reflected the fair market value of the property at the
time”). Before the Seventh Circuit, Robers did suggest that
the banks should have sold more quickly. See Brief for Appellant in
No. 10–3794, p. 35 (“[T]here is no ‘loss
causation’ here, . . . because the kind of loss
that occurred (due to the market, or to the victims holding the
property longer than they should have in a declining market, or to
other unknown factors) was not the kind for which the
defendant’s acts could have controlled or accounted”).
But this argument does not imply that the banks’ delay
reflected a choice to hold the homes as investments, only that the
banks misjudged the timing of the sales.
