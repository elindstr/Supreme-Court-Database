															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–954

															_________________

															JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, et al., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 30, 2022]

															Justice Barrett, with whom Justice Thomas,
Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch join as to all but the first
sentence, dissenting.

															I agree with the Court’s analysis of the
merits—but not with its decision to reach them. The lower
courts in this case concluded that 8 U. S. C.
§1252(f )(1), a provision of the Immigration and
Nationality Act sharply limiting federal courts’
“jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the
operation of ” certain immigration laws, did not present
a jurisdictional bar. Just two weeks ago, however, we repudiated
their reasoning in Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596
U. S. ___ (2022). Because we are a court of review and not
first view, I would vacate and remand for the lower courts to
reconsider their assertion of jurisdiction in light of Aleman
Gonzalez.

															*  *  *

															Section 1252(f )(1) provides that
“no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have
jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation
of ” specified immigration provisions, except as applied
to “an individual alien against whom proceedings under [those
provisions] have been initiated.” Some lower courts have
narrowly interpreted this provision, holding that it does not bar
relief that a plaintiff frames as “requir[ing]” (rather
than preventing) the Government’s enforcement of or
compliance with the covered immigration laws. E.g., 20
F. 4th 928, 1004 (CA5 2021). In this case, that was the only
ground pressed by respondents below and relied on by the lower
courts to hold that §1252(f )(1) did not “ba[r]
jurisdiction.” Ibid.; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a;
Brief for Appellees in No. 21–10806 (CA5),
pp. 40–41. But we just rejected this interpretation in
Aleman Gonzalez. There, we held that §1252(f )(1)
deprives lower courts of “jurisdiction to entertain”
requests for “injunctions that order federal officials to
take or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or
otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions”
(subject to an exception, indisputably inapplicable to this case,
for a suit by an individual noncitizen in proceedings under those
provisions). 596 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 5).

															In the normal course, we would vacate and remand
this case for further proceedings in light of Aleman
Gonzalez. Instead, the Court plows ahead to break new
jurisdictional ground. Acting on a compressed timeline, it embraces
a theory of §1252(f )(1) that—so far as I can
tell—no court of appeals has ever adopted: that
§1252(f )(1) limits only the lower courts’ remedial
authority, not their subject-matter jurisdiction. The only court of
appeals to have addressed this theory rejected it. Miranda
v. Garland, 34 F. 4th 338, 354–356 (CA4 2022).
Still, the Court is confident enough to proceed based on short,
barely adversarial supplemental briefs. (The United States’
original brief devoted only a conclusory footnote to the
jurisdictional question, and Texas and Missouri did not respond.)
And these supplemental briefs are particularly unhelpful because,
having been submitted prior to our decision in Aleman
Gonzalez, they could not address that decision’s
significance for this case. In fact, they devoted a considerable
portion of their allotted length to the issue that Aleman
Gonzalez subsequently resolved.

															This would all matter less if the jurisdictional
question were easy or unimportant—but it is neither. The
Court’s opinion papers over difficult issues, as I will
discuss below, and its jurisdictional holding is likely to affect
many cases. See, e.g., Texas v. Biden, ___
F. Supp. 3d ___, ___, 2022 WL 658579, *14 (ND Tex., Mar. 4,
2022) (§1252(f )(1) does not bar Texas’ claim that
the Federal Government is wrongly refusing to detain noncitizens to
determine if they have COVID–19); Defendants’
Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary Restraining
Order 8–9 in Arizona v. CDC, Civ. No.
6:22–cv–00885 (WD La., Apr. 22, 2022) (arguing that
§1252(f )(1) prohibits a district court from constraining
the Federal Government’s removal discretion in litigation
challenging termination of Title 42 order). We should not short
circuit the ordinary process.

															I have several doubts about the Court’s
analysis of §1252(f )(1). To begin with, the Court
assumes that we face an either/or choice between subject-matter
jurisdiction and remedial authority, with the former being only
about a court’s authority to decide merits questions and the
latter being only about the relief a court can grant. Ante,
at 9. This dichotomy makes the Court’s job easier, because it
can use the obvious point that §1252(f )(1) strips lower
courts of remedial authority to establish that
§1252(f )(1) does not strip them of subject-matter
jurisdiction. But why is it a binary choice? I would think that
Congress is free to link a court’s subject-matter
jurisdiction to its remedial authority. That is not so different
from an amount-in-controversy requirement, which conditions a
district court’s ability to address the merits on the relief
that the plaintiff seeks. See, e.g., 28 U. S. C.
§1332 (district courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over
diversity cases only when the amount in controversy exceeds
$75,000). And the redressability requirement of Article III itself
establishes a tie between jurisdiction and remedies, because a
court’s inability to order effective relief deprives it of
jurisdiction to decide the merits of a question otherwise within
its competence. See, e.g., California v.
Texas, 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 7)
(redressability “consider[s] the relationship between
‘the judicial relief requested’ and the
‘injury’ suffered”); Los Angeles v.
Lyons, 461 U.S.
95, 105–107 (1983) (failure to allege sufficient
likelihood of future injury deprives a federal court of Article III
“jurisdiction to entertain [the count] of the
complaint” seeking injunctive relief ).

															So it seems to me quite possible that
§1252(f )(1) withdraws subject-matter jurisdiction over
cases seeking certain remedies. Indeed, while the Government has a
theory for why the Court can reach the merits in this case, it
characterizes §1252(f )(1) as imposing
“jurisdictional limitations” that “speak to
‘a court’s power’ ” and
“ ‘can never be forfeited or
waived.’ ” Supplemental Brief for Petitioners
19–20; see also Miranda, 34 F. 4th, at 354
(concluding that “§1252(f )(1) is a
jurisdiction-stripping statute” that cannot be waived). If
there is a reason to treat limitations on subject-matter
jurisdiction and limitations on remedial authority as mutually
exclusive—either in general or in this statutory
scheme—the Court does not explain it.

															The Court breezes past other questions too. Most
notably, it gives surprisingly little attention to a phrase on
which it places significant weight: §1252(f )(1)’s
parenthetical exempting “the Supreme Court” from its
general bar on “jurisdiction or authority.” The parties
hardly discuss this parenthetical, which does not appear to have an
analogue elsewhere in the United States Code. The Court, however,
takes the phrase as conclusive evidence that §1252(f )(1)
does not deprive district courts of subject- matter jurisdiction
over “non-individual claims under [the covered
provisions],” because if it did, “no such claims could
ever arrive at this Court, rendering the provision’s specific
carveout for Supreme Court injunctive relief nugatory.”
Ante, at 10.

															While this interpretation has some surface
appeal, the Court does not explain how it would work. Does it mean
that the restriction on remedial authority is subject to waiver or
forfeiture, so that a lower court can sometimes properly enter
non-individual injunctive relief that this Court can then review?
That a district court has the authority to enter some kinds of
non-individual relief (for example, a classwide declaratory
judgment) and that this Court can enter different relief (for
example, a classwide injunction) on review of that judgment? Or
that this Court can enter an injunction on appeal if the district
court could have entered at least one form of relief, even
if it actually entered only relief that exceeded its
authority?[1]* Or perhaps the
parenthetical serves the very different purpose of clarifying that
§1252(f )(1) does not disturb any pre-existing authority
this Court has under the All Writs Act or other sources. These are
difficult questions, yet the Court does not address any of
them.

															Indeed, the Court explicitly chooses not
to opine on some of the issues that might help explain the
parenthetical’s unusual reservation. See ante, at 12,
n. 4. For example, the Court declines to decide whether the
bar in §1252(f )(1) is subject to forfeiture, even though
that is a defining feature of nonjurisdictional rules. See,
e.g., Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs. of
Chicago, 583 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2017) (slip op., at
2–3). It reserves the question whether §1252(f )(1)
bars declaratory relief, an issue on which there are conflicting
views. Compare Alli v. Decker, 650 F.3d 1007, 1013
(CA3 2011) (it does not bar declaratory relief ), with
id., at 1019–1021 (Fuentes, J., dissenting) (it does),
with Hamama v. Adducci, 912 F.3d 869, 880, n. 8
(CA6 2018) (it depends). And it avoids a position on whether
§1252(f )(1) prevents a lower court from vacating or
setting aside an agency action under the Administrative Procedure
Act. See 5 U. S. C. §706(2). Not that I fault the
Court for holding back. Quite the contrary: The questions
surrounding §1252(f )(1) are complex and deserve more
attention than we can give them in this posture.

															As a final touch, the Court asserts that our
precedent has already charted this course. Ante, at
11–12. But the Court cannot muster much on that front. It
cites a passing statement rejecting an inapposite argument that
§1252(f )(1) is a jurisdictional grant, see
Reno v. American-Arab Anti- Discrimination Comm.,
525 U.S.
471, 481 (1999), a brief discussion from a plurality opinion in
a case where the §1252(f )(1) issue had not been briefed
or argued by the parties in this Court, see Nielsen v.
Preap, 586 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2019) (slip op.,
at 8–9), and a dissent, see Jennings v.
Rodriguez, 583 U. S ___, ___ (2018) (opinion of Breyer,
J.) (slip op., at 31). None provides a clear roadmap for this
case.

															*  *  *

															Given all this, I would tread more carefully.
We should let the lower courts be the first to address the
substantial antecedent questions that §1252(f )(1)
presents in light of our hot-off-the-presses decision in Aleman
Gonzalez. I respectfully dissent.

Notes
1
*For instance, in this case,
the States sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and
vacatur of the Government’s termination of the Migrant
Protection Protocols, but the District Court expressly entered only
the latter two. If the District Court could have issued a
declaratory judgment, perhaps this Court could exercise appellate
jurisdiction even if the District Court lacked authority to issue
an injunction or vacatur. The Court suggests that this happened in
Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U. S. ___ (2019), in
which, it says, the District Court also awarded only injunctive
relief. Ante, at 11. But the issue is more complicated than
the Court lets on. Preap involved consolidated cases. In the
first, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, but
the District Court entered only the latter. See Preap v.
Johnson, 303 F.R.D. 566, 587 (ND Cal. 2014). In the second,
however, the District Court entered “only [a] declaratory
ruling,” with no accompanying injunction. Khoury v.
Asher, 3 F. Supp. 3d 877, 892 (WD Wash. 2014). So
unlike today’s case, Preap did not involve only a
hypothetical declaratory judgment.
