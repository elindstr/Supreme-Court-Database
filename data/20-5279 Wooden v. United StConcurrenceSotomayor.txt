															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															WILLIAM DALE WOODEN, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[March 7, 2022]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring.

															I join the opinion of the Court because on the facts of this case, it is clear that Wooden’s prior convictions did not take place “on occasions different from one another,” as required for the sentencing enhancement to apply.

18 U. S. C. §924(e)(1).  Justice Gorsuch raises questions about the clarity of the record below, but in my view, those questions only underscore the Government’s failure to carry its burden of proving the enhancement’s application.  See Pereida v. Wilkinson, 592 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 14) (citing Johnson v. United States,

559 U.S. 133, 137 (2010)).  I agree with Justice Gorsuch, however, that the rule of lenity provides an independent basis for ruling in favor of a defendant in a closer case, and I join Parts II–IV of his opinion concurring in the judgment.
