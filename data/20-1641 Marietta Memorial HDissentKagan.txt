															MARIETTA MEMORIAL HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN, et al., PETITIONERS v. DaVITA INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[June 21, 2022]

															

															Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, dissenting in part.

															Today the Court crafts for the Medicare Secondary Payer Act (MSPA) a massive and inexplicable workaround.  The MSPA instructs that a group health plan “may not differentiate in the benefits it provides between individuals having end stage renal disease and other individuals covered by such plan on the basis of the existence of end stage renal disease, the need for renal dialysis, or in any other manner.”

42 U. S. C. §1395y(b)(1)(C)(ii).  The majority holds that the plan here does not so “differentiate” because it draws distinctions only between dialysis and other treatments—not between individuals with end stage renal disease and individuals without it.  See ante, at 6, n. 2.  That conclusion flies in the face of both common sense and the statutory text.[1]*

															One fact is key to understanding this case: Outpatient dialysis is an almost perfect proxy for end stage renal disease.  Virtually everyone with end stage renal disease—and hardly anyone else—undergoes outpatient dialysis.  Ninety-seven percent of people diagnosed with end stage renal disease—all those who do not obtain a preemptive kidney transplant—undergo dialysis.  See National Institutes of Health, United States Renal Data System, 2021 Ann. Data Rep.: End Stage Renal Disease, ch. 1, figure 1.2, https://adr.usrds.org/2021/end-stage-renal-disease.  And 99.5% of DaVita’s outpatient dialysis patients have or develop end stage renal disease.  See Brief for Respondents 6.

															Because that is so, common sense suggests that we should not care whether a health plan differentiates in benefits by targeting people with end stage renal disease, or instead by targeting the use of dialysis.  When “status and conduct” are proxies for each other, “[o]ur decisions have declined to distinguish” between them.  Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal., Hastings College of Law v. Martinez,

561 U.S. 661, 689 (2010).  So, for example, we have explained that a penalty for “homosexual conduct” is a penalty for “homosexual persons.”  Lawrence v. Texas,

539 U.S. 558, 575 (2003).  And likewise, a “tax on wearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews.”  Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic,

506 U.S. 263, 270 (1993).  The same goes here: A reimbursement limit for outpatient dialysis is in reality a reimbursement limit for people with end stage renal disease.  And so a plan singling out dialysis for disfavored coverage “differentiate[s] in the benefits it provides between individuals having end stage renal disease and other individuals.”  §1395y(b)(1)(C)(ii).  That is so even if, as petitioner Marietta notes, dialysis is also a treatment for some miniscule number of people with acute kidney injury.  See Reply Brief 13.  That a proxy is only 99.5% (not 100%) accurate should make no difference.  A tax on yarmulkes remains a tax on Jews, even if friends of other faiths might occasionally don one at a Bar Mitzvah.

															And if common sense were not enough, statutory text would come to the rescue.  Congress was well aware of the relationship between end stage renal disease and dialysis—and the text it wrote reflects that knowledge.  The statute proscribes not just differentiation “on the basis of the existence of end stage renal disease,” but also “on the basis of . . . the need for renal dialysis, or in any other manner.”  §1395y(b)(1)(C)(ii).  The back half of that provision prevents exactly the circumvention the majority today allows.  It bars plans from differentiating between people with and without end stage renal disease even when that differentiation is accomplished indirectly—by targeting their treatment, or by relying on some other proxy for the condition.  So contra the majority, the statutory text does indeed prohibit differentiation as to services—and not only as to individuals.  See ante, at 6, n. 2.

															That reading also fits with the statute’s purpose.  As the majority recognizes, the MSPA’s renal disease provisions were designed to prevent plans from foisting the cost of dialysis onto Medicare.  See ante, at 2.  Yet the Court now tells plans they can do just that, so long as they target dialysis, rather than the patients who rely on it, for disfavored coverage.  Congress would not—and did not—craft a statute permitting such a maneuver.  Now Congress will have to fix a statute this Court has broken.  I respectfully dissent.
Notes

*Like the majority, I am unpersuaded by DaVita’s arguments concerning disparate-impact liability and the MSPA’s separate take-into-account clause.  See ante, at 5, 7.  But I part ways with the majority as to DaVita’s “proxy” theory (which the majority relegates to a footnote).  See ante, at 6, n. 2.
