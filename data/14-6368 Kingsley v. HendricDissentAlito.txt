															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															MICHAEL B. KINGSLEY, PETITIONER v. STANHENDRICKSON, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 22, 2015]

															

															Justice Alito, dissenting.

															I would dismiss this case as improvidently granted.  Before deciding what a pretrial detainee must show in order to prevail on a due process excessive force claim, we should decide whether a pretrial detainee can bring a
 
Fourth Amendment claim based on the use of excessive force by a detention facility employee.  We have not yet decided that question.  See Graham v. Connor,

490 U. S. 386
, n. 10 (1989).  If a pretrial detainee can bring such a claim, we need not and should not rely on substantive due process.  See Albright v. Oliver,

510 U. S. 266,
273 (1994)
 (plurality opinion); Graham, 490 U. S., at 395.  It is settled that the test for an unreasonable seizure under the
 
Fourth Amendment is objective, see id., at 397, so if a pretrial detainee can bring such a claim, it apparently would be indistinguishable from the substantive due process claim that the Court discusses.

															I would not decide the due process issue presented in this case until the availability of a
 
Fourth Amendment claim is settled, and I would therefore dismiss this case as improvidently granted.
