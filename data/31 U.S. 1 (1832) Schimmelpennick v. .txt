U.S. Supreme Court
Schimmelpennick v. Turner, 31 U.S. 6
Pet. 1 1 (1832)
Schimmelpennick v.
Turner
31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 1
ON CERTIFICATE OF DIVISION FROM THE
CIRCUIT COURT
OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE
DISTRICT OF MARYLAND
Syllabus

															The declaration contained two counts. The first, setting out the
cause of action, stated

															"For that whereas the said defendants and co-partners, trading
under the firm of Josiah, Turner & Company in the lifetime of
said William, on 1 March, 1821,"

															were indebted to the plaintiffs; and being so indebted,

															&c.

															The second count was upon an insimul computassent, and
began

															"And also whereas the said defendants afterwards, to-wit, on the
day and year aforesaid, accounted with the said plaintiffs of and
concerning divers other sums of money due and owing from the said
defendants,"

															&c. The defendants, to maintain the issue on their parts,
gave in evidence to the jury that William Turner, the person
mentioned in the declaration, died on 6 January, 1819, that he was
formerly a partner with Josiah and Philip Turner, the defendants,
under the firm of Josiah Turner & Company, but that the
partnership was dissolved in October, 1817, and that the defendants
formed a co-partnership in 1820. The defendants prayed the court to
instruct the jury that there is a variance between the contract
declared on and the contract given in evidence, William Turner
being dead.

															By the court:

															"The only allegation in the second count in the declaration,
from which it is argued that the contract declared upon was one
including William Turner with Joseph and Philip is 'that the said
defendants accounted with the plaintiffs.' But this does not
warrant the conclusion drawn from it. The defendants were Josiah
and Philip Turner;

															Page 31 U. S. 2

															William Turner was not a defendant, and the terms 'the said
defendants' could not include him. There was no variance between
the contract declared upon in the second count and the contract
proved upon the trial with respect to the parties thereto."

															In the circuit court, the plaintiffs, on 29 April, 1825, sued
out a writ of capias ad respondendum in an action of
assumpsit against "Josiah Turner, and Philip Turner, surviving
partners of William Turner, citizens of Maryland, merchants."

															The declaration in the case contained two counts; the first
count charged the defendant for work, labor, and services, for
goods sold and delivered, and for money lent, paid, and advanced in
the following terms:

															Josiah Turner, and Philip Turner, surviving partners of William
Turner, citizens of Maryland, merchants, were attached to answer
the plaintiffs

															"of a plea of trespass on the case, &c., and thereupon the
said plaintiffs, by J. Glenn their attorney, complain for that
whereas the said defendants, merchants and co-partners, trading
under the firm of Josiah Turner & Company, in the lifetime of
the said William,"

															on the 1 March, 1822, were indebted to the plaintiffs,
&c.

															The second count was on an alleged insimul
computassent, charging that

															"The said defendants afterwards, to-wit on the day and year
aforesaid, accounted with the said plaintiffs of and concerning
divers other sums of money, before that time due and owing from the
said defendants to the said plaintiffs, and then being in arrears
and unpaid. . . ."

															The defendants pleaded nonassumpsit; and before the
case came on for trial, depositions of witnesses were taken in New
York and in Holland, under commissions issued for the purpose,
which showed that the ground of action was for advances made by the
agent of the plaintiffs in September and October, 1819, and in
January, 1820, on shipments of tobacco, the property of Josiah
Turner and Philip Turner consigned to the plaintiffs and by them
sold for the account of the defendants. From these transactions a
balance was by the accounts current of the plaintiffs claimed to be
due to them, and the accounts current of the plaintiffs were by the
testimony in the case shown to have been furnished to the
defendants by

															Page 31 U. S. 3

															the agent of the plaintiffs at different periods, and
particularly in June, 1822. No acknowledgement or admission of the
correctness of the account was given in evidence.

															The defendants, to maintain the issue on their part, gave in
evidence to the jury that William Turner, the person mentioned in
the declaration, died on 6 January, 1819; that the said William was
formerly a partner with the said Josiah and Philip under the firm
of Josiah Turner & Company, but that the said co-partnership
was dissolved in October, 1817; and that a new co-partnership was
formed between the said Josiah and Philip in 1820, under the firm
of Josiah Turner & Company.

															Whereupon the defendants by their counsel prayed the opinion of
the court and its direction to the jury that the plaintiffs are not
entitled to recover, because the defendants are sued as surviving
partners of William Turner, whereas the proof is that William
Turner had departed this life some months before the first
transaction took place between the plaintiffs and defendants, and
therefore could not constitute one of the firm of the defendants at
any time during the transactions in question, and that therefore
there is a variance between the contract declared on and the
contract given in evidence, upon which prayer the opinions of the
judges were opposed, and the same, on motion of the plaintiffs by
their counsel was certified to the Supreme Court agreeably to the
act of Congress.

															MR. JUSTICE THOMPSON delivered the opinion of the Court.

															This case comes up from the Circuit Court for the District of
Maryland upon a division of opinion in that court upon a point
stated on the record in the following manner, viz.,

															"And thereupon the defendants, to maintain the issue on their
part, gave in evidence to the jury that William Turner, the person
mentioned in the declaration in this cause, died on 6 January,
1819. That the said William was formerly a partner with the said
Josiah and Philip under the firm of Josiah Turner & Company,
but that the said co-partnership was dissolved in October, 1817,
and that a new co-partnership was formed between the said Josiah
and Philip in 1820 under the firm of Josiah Turner &
Company."

															"Whereupon the defendants by their counsel prayed the

															Page 31 U. S. 6

															opinion of the court and its direction to the jury that the
plaintiffs are not entitled to recover, because the defendants are
sued as surviving partners of William Turner, whereas the proof is
that William Turner had departed this life some months before the
first transaction took place between the plaintiffs and defendants,
and therefore could not constitute one of the firm of the
defendants at any time during the transaction in question, and that
therefore there is a variance between the contract declared on and
the contract given in evidence. Upon which prayer the opinions of
the judges were opposed."

															The declaration contains two counts. The first, setting out the
cause of action, states as follows:

															"For that whereas the said defendants, merchants and co-partners
trading under the firm of Josiah Turner & Co. in the lifetime
of said William, on 1 March in the year 1821, were indebted to the
plaintiffs, &c., and being so indebted, the defendants
undertook and promised to pay, &c."

															The second count is upon an insimul computassent, and
begins:

															"Whereas also the said defendants afterwards, to-wit, on the day
and year aforesaid, accounted with the said plaintiffs of and
concerning divers other sums of money due and owing from the said
defendants and then in arrear and unpaid, and being so found in
arrear, the defendants promised to pay,"

															&c.

															Whatever objection may arise under the first count in the
declaration with respect to a variance between the contract or
cause of action and the evidence to maintain it, that objection
does not exist as to the second count. It is to be borne in mind
that it forms no part of the question upon which the opinion of the
judges was opposed whether the evidence was admissible under the
count upon an insimul computassent. The point of objection
was that the cause of action as stated in the declaration arose
against the defendants and William Turner, and the evidence only
showed a cause of action against the two defendants unconnected
with William Turner, and which arose since his decease.

															The only allegation in the second count in the declaration from
which it is argued that the contract declared upon was one
including William Turner with Josiah and Philip is that the said
defendants accounted with the plaintiffs, &c. But

															Page 31 U. S. 7

															this does not warrant the conclusion drawn from it. The
defendants were Josiah and Philip Turner. William Turner was not a
defendant, and the reference by the terms the said defendants could
not include him. It does not even describe the defendants as
survivors, or allege that they accounted as such or in the lifetime
of William Turner. But the whole cause of action as set out in this
count arose against Josiah and Philip, entirely unconnected with
William. The evidence therefore showing that William Turner died
before the first transaction took place between the defendants and
plaintiffs did not show any variance between the contract declared
upon in this count and the contract proved. The one declared upon
in the second count was between the plaintiffs and the defendants
Josiah and Philip Turner, and the evidence did not show a contract
varying from it.

															We are accordingly of opinion that there was no variance between
the contract declared upon in the second count and the contract
proved upon the trial with respect to the parties thereto.

															This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of
Maryland and on the point and question on which the judges of the
said circuit court were opposed in opinion, and which point was
certified to this Court for its opinion in pursuance of the act of
Congress in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel,
on consideration whereof it is the opinion of this Court that there
was no variance between the contract declared upon in the second
count and the contract proved upon the trial with respect to the
parties thereto, whereupon it is ordered and adjudged by this Court
that it be certified to the said circuit court as the opinion of
this Court that there was no variance between the contract declared
upon in the second count and the contract proved upon the trial
with respect to the parties thereto.
