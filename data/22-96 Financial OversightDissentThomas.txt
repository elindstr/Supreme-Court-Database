															FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT BOARD FOR
PUERTO RICO, PETITIONER v. CENTRO DE PERIODISMO
INVESTIGATIVO, INC.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the first circuit

															[May 11, 2023]

															

															Justice Thomas, dissenting.

															At every stage of these proceedings, respondent
has argued that petitioner lacks state sovereign immunity.
Petitioner has consistently replied that it has that immunity and
that nothing abrogates it. The courts below, bound by Circuit
precedent, held that petitioner does have state sovereign
immunity—but they also held that the immunity has been
abrogated. The Court today disagrees with only that latter
conclusion, holding that nothing abrogates petitioner’s
immunity, but it “assume[s] without deciding” the
logically antecedent question whether petitioner enjoys that
immunity in the first place. Ante, at 5. In doing so, the
majority effectively decides the outcome of this case. Because I
would reach the antecedent question and hold that petitioner lacks
the only immunity it has ever asserted, I respectfully dissent.

															Respondent, Centro de Periodismo Investigativo,
Inc. (CPI), sued petitioner, the Financial Oversight and Management
Board for Puerto Rico, over a document-disclosure dispute. The
Board moved to dismiss the lawsuit by invoking state sovereign
immunity, which the Board claimed to possess as an arm of the
Puerto Rican territorial government. CPI responded (both in the
District Court and on appeal) that Puerto Rico has no such immunity
and that, even if it did, that immunity would be abrogated by the
Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act
(PROMESA), 48 U. S. C. §2101 et seq.
Bound by Circuit precedent holding that Puerto Rico enjoys state
sovereign immunity, each court below rejected CPI’s first
argument. See 35 F. 4th 1, 14 (CA1 2022). But the courts below
also agreed with CPI’s second argument that the Board’s
immunity was abrogated.

															When the Board asked us to review that holding,
CPI once again raised its lead argument, pointing out that we
logically could not reverse the First Circuit’s judgment
without first addressing whether the Board actually has the
immunity that the Board claims has not been abrogated. And, in its
merits brief, CPI made Puerto Rico’s lack of state sovereign
immunity its lead argument. There is nothing more that CPI could
have done to preserve this antecedent, dispositive argument.

															Yet the majority skips it entirely,
“assum[ing] without deciding that Puerto Rico is immune from
suit in federal district court”—while also deciding
that PROMESA does not abrogate that assumed immunity. Ante,
at 5. In doing so, it effectively consigns CPI’s case to the
dustbin, remanding back to a Circuit where Circuit precedent will
dictate the outcome. CPI might be forgiven for wondering whether we
granted certiorari only insofar as our review would favor the
Board.

															The majority asserts that it need not address
CPI’s argument because “[t]he proceedings below did not
examine these matters, and we agreed to tackle only the abrogation
question.” Ibid. But it is unclear why the court below
would have examined the matter any further, given its
precedent.[1] And,
“[t]his issue is predicate to an intelligent resolution of
the question presented,” as it makes no sense to analyze
whether PROMESA abrogates state sovereign immunity without first
determining whether that immunity is implicated at all. United
States v. Grubbs, 547 U.S.
90, 94, n. 1 (2006) (internal quotation marks
omitted).[2] Because I think
the Court has a duty to pass upon issues that are fairly presented,
preserved by the parties, and necessary to support its judgment, I
would consider whether the Board has the immunity it asserts.

															From the start, the Board has asserted only that
it possesses what it has called “ Eleventh Amendment
immunity.” The First Circuit agreed, explaining that it
“has long treated Puerto Rico like a state for Eleventh
Amendment purposes.” 35 F. 4th, at 14. However, the
plain text of the Eleventh Amendment applies only to lawsuits
brought against a State by citizens of another State. And, because
CPI is a resident of Puerto Rico, I can only assume that the Board
and the First Circuit meant to refer to the sovereign immunity that
is inherent in the 50 States. See Allen v. Cooper,
589 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 4).

															As we have explained, inherent state sovereign
immunity reflects the original design of the Constitution. See
Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, 587 U. S.
___, ___–___ (2019) (slip op., at 5–12). At the
Founding, the “States considered themselves fully sovereign
nations,” and part of that sovereignty “was their
immunity from private suits.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,
at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted). When advocating for the
Constitution’s ratification, leading Federalists then assured
their opponents that the Constitution would not allow private
citizens to hale States into federal court without their consent.
See ibid. Though this Court held otherwise soon thereafter
in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), the
Eleventh Amendment’s swift ratification confirmed that
Chisholm was wrong. See Hyatt, 587 U. S., at
___–___ (slip op., at 11–12). Thus, in general, the
Constitution does not allow federal or state courts to hear cases
against States without their consent. See id., at
___–___ (slip op., at 13–16); Alden v.
Maine, 527 U.S.
706, 730–731 (1999). This deeply rooted rule
“inheres in the system of federalism” that the
Constitution establishes. See id., at 730.[3]

															Here, however, all sides agree that Puerto Rico
is a Territory, not a State. See Puerto Rico v.
Sánchez Valle, 579 U.S. 59, 75–77 (2016).
Accordingly, it is difficult to see how the same inherent sovereign
immunity that the States enjoy in federal court would apply to
Puerto Rico. To be sure, the United States has urged us to hold
that Puerto Rico enjoys a form of common-law immunity that, it
claims, territorial governments can invoke in federal court. See
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16–19. But
the Board has, at every stage, argued only that it possesses the
same immunity as States. That argument appears untenable. And, as
the party asserting an immunity, the Board should have the burden
of establishing its immunity. Because the Board has failed to do
so, I would rule in CPI’s favor and affirm the judgment
below.

															I respectfully dissent.

Notes
1
 The fact that the First
Circuit barely addressed the issue below, simply noting Circuit
precedent, is surely irrelevant; we have often granted certiorari
on questions that were resolved below with drive-by citations to
binding precedent, sometimes in footnotes. See, e.g., App.
to Pet. for Cert. in Lora v. United States, O. T.
2022, No. 22–49, p. 11a, n. 3; App. to Pet. for Cert. in
Smith v. United States, O. T. 2022, No.
21–1576, p. 15a.
2
 We have often recognized
the need to address such logically antecedent questions. See,
e.g., Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S.
61, 75, n. 13 (1996); see also Vance v.
Terrazas, 444 U.S.
252, 258–259, n. 5 (1980) (collecting cases). For
example, we explained in Grubbs that it would “mak[e]
little sense to address what the Fourth Amendment requires of
anticipatory search warrants if it does not allow them at
all.” 547 U. S., at 94, n. 1. And, in
Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights,
Inc., 547 U.S.
47 (2006), we explained that “granting certiorari to
determine whether a statute is constitutional fairly includes the
question of what that statute says.” Id., at
56.

 The Court has described
this unique form of sovereign immunity as belonging to the 13
original States by dint of their post-Independence and
pre-Ratification independent sovereignty and to the subsequently
admitted States as a result of their admission to the Union on an
equal footing with the original States. Alden, 527
U. S., at 713; see also Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian
Community, 572 U.S.
782, 816, n. 1 (2014) (Thomas, J., dissenting); accord,
Hyatt, 587 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at
11–14) (noting unique nature of state sovereign
immunity).
