															TAE D. JOHNSON, ACTING DIRECTOR OF U. S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCE- MENT, et al., PETITIONERS v. ANTONIO ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit

															[June 13, 2022]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins as to Part I, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion because it correctly decides that

8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(6) does not require periodic, 6-month bond hearings.  I write separately to make three points.

															I

															First, we lack jurisdiction to hear this case.  Under

8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9), a federal court has jurisdiction to review “questions of law and fact . . . arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien . . . only” in two circumstances: (1) when the court reviews a “final order” of removal, or (2) when §1252 otherwise grants jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Johnson v. Guzman Chavez, 594 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1); Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (same) (slip op., at 3–4).  This jurisdictional zipper clause “cover[s] all claims related to removal proceedings,” including detention-related “withholding-of-removal claims.”  Guzman Chavez, 594 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 4–7).

															Because Arteaga-Martinez does not seek review of a final removal order or otherwise invoke §1252, and because his claim “aris[es] from” his removal proceedings, I would vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  Nonetheless, “because the Court has held that we have jurisdiction in cases like these, and the Court’s opinion is otherwise correct,” I join it in full.  Guzman Chavez, 594 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted).

															II

															Second, as I have explained elsewhere, there is considerable historical evidence that the Due Process Clause does not “apply to laws governing the removal of aliens.”  Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 6).  But even assuming the Due Process Clause extends to some aliens contesting their removability, it does not protect from detention an alien who, like  Arteaga-Martinez, does not challenge his final removal order.  Illegal aliens deemed removable have no “right of release into this country.”  Zadvydas v. Davis,

533 U.S. 678, 703 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Although the Court properly declines to decide Arteaga-Martinez’s due process claim, see ante, at 9, we should revisit whether the Due Process Clause applies at all in this context.

															III

															Third, this case illustrates why we should overrule Zadvydas at the earliest opportunity.  There, the Court held that §1231(a)(6) “would raise a serious constitutional problem” under the
 
Fifth Amendment if it permitted “indefinite detention of an alien.”  Id., at 690.  To avoid that supposed “problem,” the Court deemed “ambiguous” the statutory authorization that a removable alien “may be detained beyond the removal period,” and then, clothed in constitutional garb, invoked that manufactured ambiguity to graft a made-up rule onto §1231(a)(6).  Id., at 697.  Namely, the Court decided that immigration authorities can detain an alien only long enough to accomplish the “basic purpose [of] effectuating an alien’s removal” and must release him “once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable.”  Id., at 697, 699.  The “presumptively reasonable” detention period, the Court declared, was six months.  Id., at 701.  The Court offered no textual support for that (or any) length of time.  See ibid.

															As we later implied in Jennings, the constitutional-avoidance canon cannot justify adoption of such an implausible construction of §1231(a)(6).  See 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  And, until we overrule Zadvydas, it will continue to invite nothing but mischief.  An ill-defined, quasi- constitutional command of “reasonableness” inevitably encourages courts to fashion procedural rules with no basis in statutory text.  We confronted that mischief in Jennings, see 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (reversing the Ninth Circuit for “all but ignor[ing] the statutory text” and instead “reading Zadvydas . . . as essentially granting a license to graft a time limit onto the text of §1225(b)”), and we do so again today, compare ante, at 8, with Guerrero-Sanchez v. Warden York County Prison, 905 F.3d 208, 223 (CA3 2018).  We will be forced to engage in this jurisprudential whack-a-mole until we recognize that Zadvydas was wrong the day it was decided and thus does not warrant “stare decisis effect.”  Clark v. Martinez,

543 U.S. 371, 401 (2005) (Thomas, J., dissenting); see also Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 17) (“[W]e should not invoke stare decisis to uphold precedents that are demonstrably erroneous”).

															*  *  *

															These three points notwithstanding, the Court’s opinion correctly interprets §1231(a)(6).  Accordingly, I concur.
