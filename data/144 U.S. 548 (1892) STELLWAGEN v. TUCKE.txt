U.S. Supreme Court STELLWAGEN v. TUCKER, 144 U.S. 548 (1892) Â 144 U.S. 548  STELLWAGEN et al. v. TUCKER et al.  No. 217.  April 11, 1892  C. J. Hillyer and J. H. Ralston, for appellants.  Henry Wise Garnett and Eppa Hunton, for appellees.  PER CURIAM.  The facts of this case are similar to those in No. 216, 12 Sup. Ct. Rep. 720, (just decided,) and the same principles of law control its disposition. A similar decree of reversal, with directions, must be entered; the form of the decree to be adapted to the changed interest caused by the death of one of the parties pending the suit.  Ordered accordingly.
