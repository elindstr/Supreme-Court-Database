SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES





															KEITH LANCE, et al., APPELLANTS v. GIGI DENNIS,
COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATE

															on appeal from the united states district court for the district of colorado

															No. 05–555. Decided February 21, 2006



															   Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Souter joins, concurring.

															
   I agree in full with the Court’s correction of the District Court’s Rooker-Feldman error, and therefore join the Court’s opinion.  Although Justice Stevens has persuasively urged that issue preclusion warrants affirmance, see post, at 2–3 (dissenting opinion), that question of Colorado law seems to me best left for full airing and decision on remand.
