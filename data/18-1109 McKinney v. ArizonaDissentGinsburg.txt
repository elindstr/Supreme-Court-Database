															JAMES ERIN McKINNEY, PETITIONER v. ARIZONA

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of arizona

															[February 25, 2020]

															

															Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.

															Petitioner James Erin McKinney, convicted in Arizona of two counts of first-degree murder, was sentenced to death in 1993.  At that time, Arizona assigned capital sentencing to trial judges.  To impose a death sentence, the judge had to find at least one aggravating circumstance and “no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.”  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–703(E) (1993).  In 2002, in Ring v. Arizona,

536 U.S. 584 (2002), this Court held Arizona’s capital sentencing regime unconstitutional.  The “aggravating factors” that render a defendant eligible for capital punishment in Arizona, the Court reasoned, “operate as ‘the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense.’ ”  Id., at 609 (quoting Apprendi v. New Jersey,

530 U.S. 466, 494, n. 19 (2000)).  “[T]he
 
Sixth Amendment [therefore] requires that [such aggravating factors] be found by a jury.”  Ibid.; see Hurst v. Florida, 577 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 1) (“The
 
Sixth Amendment requires a jury, not a judge, to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death.”).  Here in dispute, does Ring apply to McKinney’s case?[1]  If it does, then McKinney’s death sentences—imposed based on aggravating factors found by a judge, not a jury—are unlawful.

															The Constitution, this Court has determined, requires the application of new rules of constitutional law to cases on direct review.  Griffith v. Kentucky,

479 U.S. 314, 322–323 (1987).  Such rules, however, do not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review unless they fall within one of two exceptions.  Teague v. Lane,

489 U.S. 288, 310 (1989) (plurality opinion).[2]  This Court has already held that Ring does not fall within those exceptions.  See Schriro v. Summerlin,

542 U.S. 348, 358 (2004).  Thus, the pivotal question: Is McKinney’s case currently on direct review, in which case Ring applies, or on collateral review, in which case Ring does not apply? [3]  I would rank the Arizona Supreme Court’s proceeding now before this Court for review as direct in character.  I would therefore hold McKinney’s death sentences unconstitutional under Ring, and reverse the judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court.

															I

															Upon the imposition of a death sentence in Arizona, a defendant’s appeal bypasses the intermediate appellate court and moves directly from the trial court to the Arizona Supreme Court.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13–4031 (2010).[4]  The statute governing such an appeal, §13–755, instructs: “The supreme court shall review all death sentences.  On review, the supreme court shall independently review the trial court’s findings of aggravation and mitigation and the propriety of the death sentence.”  §13–755(A).[5]  Independent review under §13–755 entails “review[ing] the entire record” without deference to the factfinder, to determine, de novo, “whether a capital sentence is not only legally correct, but also appropriate.”  State v. Roseberry, 237 Ariz. 507, 509–510, 353 P.3d 847, 849–850 (2015).  In 1996, the Arizona Supreme Court reviewed McKinney’s sentences under the foregoing scheme and affirmed the trial court’s dispositions.

															McKinney then sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.  In 2015, the en banc United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Arizona Supreme Court, when it independently reviewed McKinney’s sentences in 1996, committed constitutional error.  Specifically, the state court, in violation of Eddings v. Oklahoma,

455 U.S. 104, 113–114 (1982),[6] refused to consider as mitigating evidence the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) McKinney suffered as a result of his horrific childhood.  See McKinney v. Ryan, 813 F.3d 798, 804.  Reversing the District Court’s judgment denying the writ of habeas corpus, the Court of Appeals remanded the case “with instructions to grant the writ with respect to McKinney’s sentence unless the state, within a reasonable period, either corrects the constitutional error in his death sentence or vacates the sentence and imposes a lesser sentence consistent with law.”  Id., at 827.  This Court denied the State’s petition for certiorari.  Ryan v. McKinney, 580 U. S. ___ (2016).

															The State thereupon asked the Arizona Supreme Court to “conduct a new independent review of McKinney’s death sentence” “to cure any error in [the prior] independent review.”  App. 389.  Granting the State’s motion in 2018, Arizona’s highest court again did as the independent-review statute instructs.  See supra, at 3.  Specifically, the court first determined that “no reasonable doubt” existed “as to the aggravating circumstances found by the trial court.”  245 Ariz. 225, 227, 426 P.3d 1204, 1206 (2018).  It then noted that “McKinney [had] proved several mitigating circumstances,” including “PTSD . . . caused by the abuse and trauma he experienced as a child.”  Ibid.  “Given the aggravating circumstances,” however, the court “conclude[d] that McKinney’s mitigating evidence [wa]s not sufficiently substantial to warrant leniency.”  Ibid.  It therefore “affirm[ed] McKinney’s death sentences” for a second time.  Id., at 229, 426 P. 3d, at 1208.

															A

															Beyond doubt, the Arizona Supreme Court engaged in direct review in 1996.  A defendant’s first opportunity to appeal his conviction and sentence is the archetype of direct review.  See Brecht v. Abrahamson,

507 U.S. 619, 633 (1993) (“Direct review is the principal avenue for challenging a conviction.”).

															The Arizona Supreme Court’s 2018 proceeding was essentially a replay of the initial direct review proceeding.  The State’s request for “a new independent review,” App. 389 (emphasis added), asked the Arizona Supreme Court to resume and redo direct review, this time in accord with Eddings.  See Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1522 (2002) (“new”: “beginning or appearing as the recurrence, resumption, or repetition of a previous act or thing”).  The Arizona Supreme Court proceeded accordingly.  That court retained for its “new independent review” the docket number earlier assigned to its initial review, App. 1, 6–11, and docket entries show that the original 1996 appeal was “Reinstated,” id., at 1.  In its 2018 review, the Arizona Supreme Court “examine[d] ‘the trial court’s findings of aggravation and mitigation and the propriety of the death sentence’ ” afresh, treating that court’s 1996 decision as though it never issued.  245 Ariz., at 227, 426 P. 3d, at 1206 (quoting §13–755).  See also supra, at 4.

															Renewal of direct review cannot sensibly be characterized as anything other than direct review.  The Arizona Supreme Court’s 2018 proceeding retread ground traversed in 1996; the two proceedings differed only in that the court’s 2018 review was free of Eddings error.  If, as the State does not contest, the court’s 1996 review ranked as review direct in character, so, too, did its 2018 do-over.[7]

															B

															The State urges that the Arizona Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Styers, 227 Ariz. 186, 254 P.3d 1132 (2011), compels a different classification of that court’s 2018 proceeding.  In Styers, as here, the Arizona Supreme Court conducted a new independent review to correct Eddings error in its previous decision affirming the defendant’s death sentence.  227 Ariz., at 187, 254 P. 3d, at 1133.  The Arizona Supreme Court regarded its second look in Styers as a collateral review for retroactivity purposes, id., at 187–188, and n. 1, 254 P. 3d, at 1133–1134, and n. 1, and followed suit in its 2018 renewed examination in this case, 245 Ariz., at 226–227, 426 P. 3d, at 1205–1206.  This Court, the State maintains, is bound by that state-law classification.  Brief for Respondent 22–25.  The State’s argument should be unavailing.  Whether the Constitution requires the application of law now in force is a question of federal constitutional law, not an issue subject to state governance.  See Griffith, 479 U. S., at 322–323.

															C

															The Court does not today hold that the classification a state supreme court assigns to a proceeding is inevitably dispositive of a retroactivity question of the kind this case presents.  See ante, at 7, n. *.  Instead, the Court looks first to the State’s classification of a proceeding, and then asks whether the character of the proceeding warrants the classification.  See ante, at 6–7 (review was “akin to harmless-error review,” which may be conducted on collateral  review).

															Accepting “collateral” as a fit description of the 2018 Arizona Supreme Court review proceeding, the Court relies on Clemons v. Mississippi, a decision holding that appellate courts can reweigh aggravating and mitigating factors as a form of “harmless-error analysis” when the factfinder “relied in part on an invalid aggravating circumstance.”

494 U.S. 738, 744, 752 (1990).  Here, however, the Ninth Circuit engaged in harmless-error review when that court evaluated McKinney’s federal habeas petition—and found the Arizona Supreme Court’s 1996 Eddings error harmful.  McKinney, 813 F. 3d, at 822–824.  The State accordingly asked the Arizona Supreme Court “to cure [that] error” by conducting a new independent review proceeding.  App. 389 (emphasis added).  In determining de novo in 2018 whether McKinney’s death sentences were “not only legally correct, but also appropriate,” Roseberry, 237 Ariz., at 509, 353 P. 3d, at 849, the Arizona Supreme Court was not conducting garden-variety harmless-error review of a lower court decision; it was rerunning direct review to correct its own prior harmful error.

															*  *  *

															Dissenting in Styers, then-Justice Hurwitz explained:

															“[I]ndependent review is the paradigm of direct review—we determine, de novo, whether the trial court, on the facts before it, properly sentenced the defendant to death.  Thus, what the State sought in this case—and what the Court has granted—is a new direct review of the death sentence, designed to obviate a constitutional error occurring in the original appeal.”  227 Ariz., at 191, 254 P. 3d, at 1137 (internal quotation marks omitted).

															Exactly right.  Because Ring controls post 2002 direct review proceedings, I would apply that precedent here and reverse the judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court.
Notes
1
 McKinney’s primary argument rests on Ring.  See Brief for Petitioner 19–33.  Curiously, the Court devotes most of its opinion, ante, at 2–5, to McKinney’s alternative argument: that Eddings error cannot be corrected by an appellate court.  Brief for Petitioner 33–47 (discussing Eddings v. Oklahoma,

455 U.S. 104 (1982)).  Because I conclude that Ring is dispositive here, I do not reach McKinney’s fallback argument. 

2
 “[S]ubstantive” rules—“rules according constitutional protection to an actor’s primary conduct” or “placing a certain class of individuals beyond the State’s power to punish” in a particular manner—apply on collateral review.  Penry v. Lynaugh,

492 U.S. 302, 329–330 (1989).  The same is true of “watershed rules of criminal procedure.”  Teague, 489 U. S., at 311. 

3
 Direct review immediately challenges a conviction; collateral review, occurring after a completed appeal, “is secondary and limited.”  Brecht v. Abrahamson,

507 U.S. 619, 633 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). 

4
 “Arizona’s capital sentencing statutes were reorganized and renumbered in 2008.”  State v. Chappell, 225 Ariz. 229, 234, n. 3, 236 P.3d 1176, 1181, n. 3 (2010).  This opinion cites a statute’s current version when materially identical to the text in effect at the relevant time. 

5
 Section 13–755 remains in effect for crimes committed before August 1, 2002.  State v. Morris, 215 Ariz. 324, 340, 160 P.3d 203, 219 (2007). 

6
 In Eddings, the sentencing judge and appellate court found mitigating evidence about the defendant’s “family history” irrelevant as a matter of law.  455 U. S., at 113.  This Court held: “Just as the State may not by statute preclude the sentencer from considering any mitigating factor, neither may the sentencer refuse to consider, as a matter of law, any relevant mitigating evidence.”  Id., at 113–114. 

7
 Further, the reason new rules do not apply on collateral review—namely, that “considerations of finality” weigh heavily when “trials and appeals conformed to then-existing constitutional standards,” Teague v. Lane,

489 U.S. 288, 309–310 (1989) (plurality opinion)—has little purchase here, where the replay of direct review was occasioned by constitutional error in the first appeal.  See McKinney v. Ryan, 813 F.3d 798, 804, 822–823 (CA9 2015).
