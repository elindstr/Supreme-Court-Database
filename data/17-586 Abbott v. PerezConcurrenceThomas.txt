															GREG ABBOTT, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, ET AL., APPELLANTS

															17–626v.

															SHANNON PEREZ, ET AL.

															on appeals from the united states district court for the western district of texas

															[June 25, 2018]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring.

															I adhere to my view that §2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 does not apply to redistricting.  See Cooper v. Harris, 581 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (concurring opinion) (slip op., at 1) (citing Holder v. Hall,

512 U. S. 874, 922–923 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)).  Thus, §2 cannot provide a basis for invalidating any district, and it cannot provide a justification for the racial gerrymander in House District 90.  Because the Court correctly applies our precedents and reaches the same conclusion, I join its opinion in full.
