ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

															MR. JUSTICE NELSON delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The indictment upon which the prisoner was convicted was founded upon the Act of Congress passed March 2, 1831, and the case, as appears from the record, agrees in all respects with the case of Forsyth v. United States, just decided, and to the opinion in which we refer for our judgment in this case.

															The motion on behalf of the Attorney General to dismiss the writ of error for want of jurisdiction is denied and the judgment of the court below reversed and the proceedings remitted to the court with direction to quash the indictment and discharge the prisoner from his recognizance or imprisonment, as the case may be.
