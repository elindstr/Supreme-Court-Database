															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															TAE D. JOHNSON, ACTING DIRECTOR OF U. S. IMMI- GRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT, et al., PETITIONERS v. MARIA ANGELICA GUZMAN CHAVEZ, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 29, 2021]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring except for footnote 4 and concurring in the judgment.

															This Court has an “independent obligation” to assess whether it has jurisdiction.  Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp.,

546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006).  We do not have it here.

															Congress has restricted our jurisdiction in removal cases.  See

8 U. S. C. §1252(b)(9); Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3).  Under §1252(b)(9), we can exercise judicial review of “questions of law and fact . . . arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien” in only two circumstances.  One is to review a final order of removal.  §1252(b)(9).  The other is to exercise an express grant of jurisdiction elsewhere in §1252.  Ibid.; Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  Neither circumstance is present here.

															Therefore, if respondents’ claims “aris[e] from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien,” the jurisdictional bar in §1252(b)(9) applies.  And for all the reasons I discussed in Jennings, challenges to detention during the removal process, such as this one, “fall within the heartland of §1252(b)(9).”  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  

															Although Jennings concerned aliens whom the Government had not yet ordered removed whereas the aliens here have removal orders reinstated against them, the result does not change.  Section 1252(b)(9) “cover[s] all claims related to removal proceedings.”  Nasrallah v. Barr, 590 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2020) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4, n. 2) (internal quotation marks omitted).  That includes claims arising after final orders of removal are issued, such as withholding-of-removal claims.  See id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 3–4).  And it includes claims like the ones here, which involve a part “of the deportation process that necessarily serve[s] the purpose of ensuring an alien’s removal.”  Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).

															In light of this jurisdictional problem, the Court should vacate and remand with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  But “because the Court has held that we have jurisdiction in cases like these” and the Court’s opinion is otherwise correct, I join it except for footnote four.  See Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)  (slip op., at 1).
