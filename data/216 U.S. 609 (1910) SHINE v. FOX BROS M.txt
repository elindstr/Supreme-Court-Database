Supreme Court of the United States  March 7, 1910  Messrs. Shepard Barclay, Thomas T. Fauntleroy, and Cornelius H. Fauntleroy for appellants.  Messrs. Herbert R. Marlatt and Frank H. Sullivan for appellee.  Per Curiam: In the circumstances disclosed by this record, we are of opinion that a direct appeal does not lie to this court from the decree of the circuit court, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.[ Shine v.
