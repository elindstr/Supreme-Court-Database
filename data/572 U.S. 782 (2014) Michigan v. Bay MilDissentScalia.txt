															MICHIGAN, PETITIONER v. BAY MILLS
INDIANCOMMUNITY et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[May 27, 2014]

															

															     Justice Scalia,
dissenting.

															     In Kiowa Tribe of Okla.
v. Manufacturing Technolo-gies, Inc., 523 U. S. 751 (1998) ,
this Court expanded the judge-invented doctrine of tribal immunity
to cover off-reservation commercial activities. Id., at 760. I
concurred in that decision. For the reasons given today in Justice
Thomas’s dissenting opinion, which I join, I am now convinced
that Kiowa was wrongly decided; that, in the intervening 16 years,
its error has grown more glaringly obvious; and that stare decisis
does not recommend its retention. Rather than insist that Congress
clean up a mess that I helped make, I would overrule Kiowa and
reverse the judgment below.
