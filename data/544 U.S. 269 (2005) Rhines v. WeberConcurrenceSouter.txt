SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-9046

															CHARLES RUSSELL RHINES, PETITIONER v.
DOUGLAS WEBER, WARDEN

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the eighth circuit

															[March 30, 2005]

															   Justice Souter, with whom Justice
Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part and concurring
in the judgment.

															   I join the Court’s opinion
with one reservation, not doctrinal but practical. Instead of
conditioning stay-and-abeyance on “good cause” for
delay, ante, at 7, I would simply hold the order
unavailable on a demonstration of “intentionally dilatory
litigation tactics,” ante, at 8. The trickiness of
some exhaustion determinations promises to infect issues of good
cause when a court finds a failure to exhaust; pro
se petitioners (as most habeas petitioners are) do not
come well trained to address such matters. I fear that threshold
enquiries into good cause will give the district courts too much
trouble to be worth the time; far better to wait for the alarm to
sound when there is some indication that a petitioner is gaming the
system.
