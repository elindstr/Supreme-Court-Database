CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
Syllabus 

															Decided upon the ground expressed in Vandenburgh v. Truscon Steel Co., ante 261 U. S. 6.

															278 F. 607 reversed.

															Certiorari to a decree of the circuit court of appeals sustaining a patent and awarding damages for infringement.

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT delivered the opinion of the Court.

															This is a review of the decree of the circuit court of appeals of the Second Circuit, sustaining the validity of claim No. 3 of the Vandenburgh patent, just considered in the previous case of Vandenburgh v. Truscon Steel Co., ante, 261 U. S. 6, and awarding $15,000 for profits to Vandenburgh for defendant's infringement.  The two cases cannot be distinguished.  We must therefore reverse 
															Page 261 U. S. 17
															 the decree of the circuit court of appeals of the Second Circuit and direct the dismissal of the bill.

															Reversed.
