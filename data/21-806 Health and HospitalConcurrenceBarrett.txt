															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															HEALTH AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF MARION
COUNTY, et al., PETITIONERS v. IVANKA TALEVSKI, as
personal representative of the ESTATE OF GORGI TALEVSKI,
DECEASED

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 8, 2023]

															

															Justice Barrett, with whom The Chief Justice
joins, concurring.

															Today’s opinion makes three important
points. First, Maine v. Thiboutot remains good law.
448 U.S. 1
(1980). Second, Gonzaga University v. Doe sets the
standard for determining when a Spending Clause statute confers
individual rights, and the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act (FNHRA)
satisfies it. 536 U.S.
273 (2002). Third, courts must carefully consider whether
individual rights established by a Spending Clause statute are
enforceable through 42 U. S. C. §1983—in the
FNHRA’s case, they are.

															As to the first point: Section 1983 provides a
cause of action against “[e]very person” who, under
color of state law, violates “any rights, privileges, or
immunities secured by the Constitution and laws.” In
Thiboutot, we held that the plain language of the statute
was not limited to “some subset of laws.” 448
U. S., at 4. Rather, the term “laws” encompasses
all federal laws, including those passed pursuant to
Congress’s Spending Clause authority. Ibid. Like the
Court, I would not abandon that holding based on petitioners’
novel contract-law theory.

															Second, our decision in Gonzaga
establishes the standard for analyzing whether Spending Clause
statutes give rise to individual rights. Under Gonzaga,
courts must ask whether “text and structure” indicate
that the statute “unambiguously” confers federal
rights. 536 U. S., at 283, 286. Relevant considerations
include whether the statute is “ ‘phrased in terms
of the persons benefited,’ ” whether it uses
“explicit rights-creating terms,” and whether it has an
“individual,” rather than an “aggregate,”
focus. Id., at 284, 290.

															This bar is high, and although the FNHRA clears
it, many federal statutes will not. As the Court explains,
§1983 actions are the exception—not the rule—for
violations of Spending Clause statutes. Ante, at 13. This is
because “the typical remedy for state noncompliance with
federally imposed conditions is not a private cause of action for
noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to
terminate funds to the State.” Pennhurst State School and
Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S.
1, 28 (1981). Indeed, since Pennhurst, we have
interpreted only two Spending Clause statutes to be enforceable
through §1983. See Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment
and Housing Authority, 479 U.S.
418, 432 (1987); Wilder v. Virginia Hospital
Assn., 496 U.S.
498, 522–523 (1990).

															The third point is that even when a statute
unambiguously confers rights, Congress can “supplant any
remedy that otherwise would be available under §1983.”
Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea
Clammers Assn., 453 U.S.
1, 21 (1981). At this step of the analysis, courts should apply
ordinary interpretive tools to determine whether the statute allows
access to §1983. Ante, at 18; see Sea Clammers,
453 U. S., at 13, 20–21 (“We look first, of
course, to the statutory language, particularly to the provisions
made therein for enforcement and relief ”). In some
cases, the text may expressly forbid §1983 actions. In others,
context may point to the same result. It is especially telling, for
example, if the statute “ ‘creat[es] a
comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with
individual enforcement under §1983.’ ”
Gonzaga, 536 U. S., at 284–285, n. 4.

															As the Court notes, the presence of an
“express private judicial right of action” typically
demonstrates that a §1983 suit is not also available.
Ante, at 19; see Rancho Palos Verdes v.
Abrams, 544 U.S.
113, 121 (2005) (express cause of action “is ordinarily
an indication that Congress did not intend to leave open a more
expansive remedy under §1983”). When the statutory cause
of action restricts available remedies or imposes procedural
hurdles to obtaining relief, the inference is even stronger. See
Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555 U.S.
246, 254 (2009) (considering whether a §1983 suit
“would have circumvented these procedures and given
plaintiffs access to tangible benefits—such as damages,
attorney’s fees, and costs—that were unavailable under
the statut[e]”); Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S.,
at 122–123 (similar).

															But an actual clash—one private judicial
remedy against another, more expansive remedy—is not required
to find that a statute forecloses recourse to §1983. Our cases
have looked to a wide range of contextual clues, like
“enforcement provisions” that “confe[r] authority
to sue . . . on government officials,” Sea
Clammers, 453 U. S., at 13, 20, and any
“administrative remedies” that the statute offers,
Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S.
992, 1012 (1984). We have noted the relevance of a centralized
review mechanism that would be undermined by piecemeal litigation.
Gonzaga, 536 U. S., at 289–290 (statute directed
the Secretary of Education to establish a review board to
investigate and adjudicate alleged violations). And we have
regularly taken account of the overall comprehensiveness of the
statute’s enforcement scheme. The more comprehensive the
scheme, the less likely that it leaves the door open for §1983
suits. Sea Clammers, 453 U. S., at 20 (“When the
remedial devices provided in a particular Act are sufficiently
comprehensive, they may suffice to demonstrate congressional intent
to preclude the remedy of suits under §1983”);
Smith, 468 U. S., at 1011–1012 (§1983 suits
unavailable “[i]n light of the comprehensive nature of the
procedures and guarantees set out” in the statute). None of
these features is necessarily determinative, but each is part of
the larger picture that courts must assess.

															Courts must tread carefully before concluding
that Spending Clause statutes may be enforced through §1983.
In this case, however, the Seventh Circuit correctly allowed
Talevski’s §1983 suit to proceed. I therefore join the
Court’s opinion in full.
