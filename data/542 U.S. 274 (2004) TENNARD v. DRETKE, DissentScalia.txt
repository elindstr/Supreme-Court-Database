    Justice Scalia,
dissenting.

															
     Petitioner argues that Texas’s
statutory special issues framework unconstitutionally
constrained the jury’s discretion to give effect to his
mitigating evidence of a low IQ score, violating the
requirement that “ ‘ “a sentencer must be allowed to
give full consideration and full effect to
mitigating circumstances.” ’ ”  Reply Brief
for Petitioner 4 (quoting Penry v. Johnson, 532 U.S. 782, 797
(2001) (Penry II), in turn quoting Johnson v.
Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 381 (1993) (O’Connor, J., dissenting)).  This
claim relies on Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 (1989)
(Penry I), a case that applied principles earlier limned
in Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104 (1982),
and Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586 (1978). 


															
      I have previously expressed my view
that this “right” to unchanneled sentencer discretion
has no basis in the Constitution.  See Penry I,
supra, at 356—360 (opinion concurring in part and
dissenting in part).  I have also said that the Court’s
decisions establishing this right do not deserve stare
decisis effect, because requiring unchanneled discretion to
say no to death cannot rationally be reconciled with our
prior decisions requiring canalized discretion to say
yes.  “[T]he practice which in Furman [v.
Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972) (per curiam)] had been described as
the discretion to sentence to death and pronounced
constitutionally prohibited, was in Woodson [v. North
Carolina, 428 U.S. 280 (1976) (plurality opinion)] and Lockett renamed
the discretion not to sentence to death and pronounced
constitutionally required.”  Walton v.
Arizona, 497 U.S. 639, 662 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment).  

															
      The Court returned greater
rationality to our Penry jurisprudence by cutting it
back in Graham v. Collins, 506 U.S. 461 (1993),
and Johnson v. Texas, supra.  I joined the
Court in this pruning effort, noting that “the essence of
today’s holding (to the effect that discretion may
constitutionally be channeled) was set forth in my dissent in
Penry.”  Id., at 374 (concurring opinion). 
As The Chief Justice notes, the lower courts’ disposition
of petitioner’s Penry claim in the present case was
entirely appropriate under these cases.  Ante, at
2—4 (dissenting opinion).	Yet the opinion for the Court
does not even acknowledge their existence.  It finds failings
in the Fifth Circuit’s framework for analyzing
Penry claims as if this Court’s own jurisprudence
were not the root of the problem.  “The simultaneous
pursuit of contradictory objectives necessarily produces
confusion.”  Walton, supra, at 667.

															
      Although the present case involves
only a COA ruling, rather than a ruling directly on the merits
of petitioner’s claim, I cannot require the issuance of a
COA when the insubstantial right at issue derives from case law
in which this Court has long left the Constitution behind and
embraced contradiction.  I respectfully dissent.
