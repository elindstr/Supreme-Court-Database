															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–1170

															_________________

															LOUIS CIMINELLI, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[May 11, 2023]

															Justice Alito, concurring.

															The opinion of the Court correctly answers the
sole question posed to us: whether the right-to-control theory
supports liability under the federal wire fraud statute. The jury
instructions embody that theory, and therefore this error, unless
harmless, requires the reversal of the judgment below. I do not
understand the Court’s opinion to address fact-specific
issues on remedy outside the question presented, including: (1)
petitioner’s ability to challenge the indictment at this
stage of proceedings, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 12(b)(3)(B); (2)
the indictment’s sufficiency, see United States v.
Miller, 471 U.S.
130, 134–135 (1985) (variance from indictment did not
make indictment insufficient); (3) the applicability of harmless
error to particular invocations of the right-to-control theory
during trial, see Neder v. United States, 527 U.S.
1, 15 (1999) (omission of element in jury instructions subject
to harmless error); and (4) the Government’s ability to retry
petitioner on the theory that he conspired to obtain, and did in
fact obtain, by fraud, a traditional form of property, viz.,
valuable contracts. On this understanding, I join the Court’s
opinion.
