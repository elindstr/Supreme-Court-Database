															ROBERT MITCHELL JENNINGS, PETITIONER v. WILLIAM STEPHENS,
DIRECTOR, TEXAS DE-PARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, COR-RECTIONAL
INSTITUTIONS DIVISION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the fifth circuit

															[January 14, 2015]

															Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

															Petitioner Robert Mitchell Jennings was sentenced to death for
capital murder. He applied for federal habeas corpus relief on
three theories of ineffective assistance of counsel, prevailing on
two. The State appealed, and Jennings defended his writ on all
three theories. We consider whether Jennings was permitted to
pursue the theory that the District Court had rejected without
taking a cross-appeal or obtaining a certificate of
appealability.

															I

															In July 1988, petitioner Robert Mitchell Jennings entered an
adult bookstore to commit a robbery. Officer Elston Howard, by
unhappy coincidence, was at the same establishment to arrest the
storeâ€™s clerk. Undeterred, Jennings shot Howard
four times, robbed the store, and escaped. Howard died from his
wounds.

															Howard was merely the most recent victim of
Jenningsâ€™ criminality. The State adjudicated
Jennings a delinquent at 14, convicted him of aggravated robbery at
17, and of additional aggravated robberies at 20. He murdered
Officer Howard only two months after his most recent release from
prison.

															Jennings was arrested, tried, and convicted of capital murder,
and the State sought the death penalty. During the punishment
phase, the State introduced evidence of
Jenningsâ€™ lengthy and violent criminal history.
Jenningsâ€™ attorney called only the prison
chaplain, who testified about Jenningsâ€™
improvement and that Jennings was not
â€œincorrigible.â€
Jenningsâ€™ attorney acknowledged the difficulty
of his sentencing defense in his closing remarks, commenting that
he could not â€œquarrel withâ€ a death
sentence, but was nonetheless pleading for mercy for his client.
The jury returned a special verdict, consistent with Texas law,
that Jennings acted deliberately in the murder and that he would
present a continuing threat to society. The trial court sentenced
Jennings to death. Texas courts affirmed
Jenningsâ€™ conviction and sentence and denied
postconviction relief. Jennings v. State, No.
APâ€“70911 (Tex. Crim. App., Jan. 20, 1993);
ExÂ parte Jennings, 2008 WL 5049911 (Tex. Crim.
App., Nov. 26, 2008).

															Jennings applied for federal habeas corpus relief, asserting, as
relevant here, three theories of ineffective assistance of counsel
in the punishment phase of his trial. Jennings first claimed trial
counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence of his
disadvantaged background, including that his conception was the
product of his motherâ€™s rape, that his mother
was only 17 when he was born, and that he grew up in poverty.
Jennings offered his mother and sister as witnesses.

															Jennings next argued that trial counsel was ineffective for
failure to investigate and to present evidence of
Jenningsâ€™ low intelligence and organic brain
damage. His trial attorney admitted in affidavit that he failed to
review the case files from Jenningsâ€™ prior
convictions, which contained a report suggesting Jennings suffered
from mild mental retardation and mild organic brain dysfunction.
(The report also suggested that Jennings malingered, feigning
mental illness in order to delay proceedings.) Jennings argued that
trial counsel should have examined Jenningsâ€™
prior case files, investigated Jenningsâ€™ mental
health problems, and presented evidence of mental impairment in the
punishment phase.

															Finally, Jennings argued that counsel was constitutionally
ineffective for stating that he could not
â€œquarrel withâ€ a death sentence.
According to Jennings, this remark expressed resignation
toâ€”even the propriety ofâ€”a
death sentence.

															Jennings cited our decision in Wiggins v.
Smith,539 U.Â S. 510 (2003), as establishing
constitutional ineffectiveness when counsel fails to investigate or
to introduce substantial mitigating evidence in a sentencing
proceeding. Though he did not cite our decision in Smith
v. Spisak,558 U.Â S. 139 (2010), he also argued
that counselâ€™s closing remarks amounted to
constitutional ineffectiveness. The parties referred to these
alleged errors as the â€œWiggins
errorsâ€ and the â€œSpisak
errorÂ â€; we use the same terminology.

															The federal habeas court granted Jennings relief on both of his
Wiggins theories, but denied relief on his Spisak
theory. Jennings v. Thaler, 2012 WL 1440387 (SD Tex.,
Apr. 23, 2012). The court ordered that the State
â€œshall release Jennings from custody unless,
within 120 days, the State of Texas grants Jennings a new
sentencing hearing or resentences him to a term of imprisonment as
provided by Texas law at the time of
Jennings[Â â€™Â ]
crime.â€ Id., at *7.

															The State appealed, attacking both Wiggins theories
(viz., trial counselâ€™s failure to present
evidence of a deprived background and failure to investigate
evidence of mental impairment). Jennings argued before the Fifth
Circuit that the District Court correctly found constitutional
ineffectiveness on both Wiggins theories, and argued again
that trial counsel performed ineffectively under his Spisak
theory. The Fifth Circuit reversed the grant of habeas corpus under
the two Wiggins theories and rendered judgment for the
State. 537 Fed. Appx. 326, 334â€“335 (2013). The
court determined that it lacked jurisdiction over
Jenningsâ€™ Spisak theory. Id., at
338â€“339. Implicitly concluding that raising
this argument required taking a cross-appeal, the panel noted that
Jennings failed to file a timely notice of appeal, see Fed. Rule
App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A), and failed to obtain a certificate of
appealability as required by28 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§2253(c). Section 2253(c) provides, as relevant here,
that â€œ[u]nless a circuit justice or judge issues
a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the
court of appeals from .Â .Â . the final order
in a habeas corpus proceeding.â€

															We granted certiorari, 572 U.Â S. ___, (2014), to
decide whether Jennings was required to file a notice of
cross-appeal and seek a certificate of appealability to pursue his
Spisak theory.

															II

															The rules governing the argumentation permissible for appellees
urging the affirmance of judgment are familiar, though this case
shows that familiarity and clarity do not go hand-in-hand.

															A

															An appellee who does not take a cross-appeal may
â€œurge in support of a decree any matter
appearing before the record, although his argument may involve an
attack upon the reasoning of the lower court.â€
United States v. American Railway Express Co.,265
U.Â S. 425,435 (1924). But an appellee who does not
cross-appeal may not â€œattack the decree with a
view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening
the rights of his adversary.â€ Ibid. Since
Jennings did not cross-appeal the denial of his Spisak
theory, we must determine whether urging that theory sought to
enlarge his rights or lessen the Stateâ€™s under
the District Courtâ€™s judgment granting habeas
relief.

															The District Courtâ€™s opinion, in its section
labeled â€œOrder,â€ commanded the
State to â€œrelease Jennings from custody unless,
within 120 days, the State of Texas grants Jennings a new
sentencing hearing or resentences him to a term of imprisonment as
provided by Texas law at the time of
Jennings[Â â€™Â ]
crime.â€ 2012 WL 1440387, at *7. The District
Courtâ€™s corresponding entry of judgment
contained similar language. App. 35. The intuitive answer to the
question whether Jenningsâ€™ new theory expands
these rights is straightforward: Jenningsâ€™
rights under the judgment were what the judgment
providedâ€”release, resentencing, or commutation
within a fixed time, at the Stateâ€™s option; the
Spisak theory would give him the same. Similarly, the
Stateâ€™s rights under the judgment were to
retain Jennings in custody pending resentencing or to commute his
sentence; the Spisak theory would allow no less.

															The State objects to this straightforward result. A conditional
writ of habeas corpus, it argues, does not merely entitle a
successful petitioner to retrial (or resentencing), but it entitles
him to retrial (or resentencing) without the challenged
errors. Because each basis for habeas relief imposes an
additional implied obligation on the State (not to repeat
that error), each basis asserted by a successful petitioner
seeks to lessen the Stateâ€™s rights at retrial,
and therefore each additional basis requires a cross-appeal.

															This is an unusual position, and one contrary to the manner in
which courts ordinarily behave. Courts reduce their opinions and
verdicts to judgments precisely to define the rights and
liabilities of the parties. Parties seeking to enforce a foreign
courtâ€™s decree do not attempt to domesticate an
opinion; they domesticate a judgment. Restatement (Third) of
Foreign Relations Law of the United States
Â§Â§ 481â€“482 (1987). A
prevailing party seeks to enforce not a district
courtâ€™s reasoning, but the
courtâ€™s judgment. Rogers v.
Hill,289 U.Â S. 582,587 (1933). This Court, like all
federal appellate courts, does not review lower
courtsâ€™ opinions, but their judgments.
Chevron, U.Â S.Â A., Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,467 U.Â S.
837,842 (1984). And so a rule that contravenes this structure, that
makes the opinion part of the judgment, is
peculiarâ€”especially when it is applied to
impose extrajudgment obligations on a sovereign State.

															The Stateâ€™s argument might have force in a
case where a district court explicitly imposes (or the
appellee asks the appellate court explicitly to impose) a condition
governing the details of the retrial. But that case is not before
us. The implications of the Stateâ€™s position
make clear why such orders are atypical, and why we should not
infer such conditions from silence. Construing every federal grant
of habeas corpus as carrying an attendant list of unstated acts (or
omissions) that the state court must perform (or not perform) would
substantially transform conditional habeas corpus relief from an
opportunity â€œto replace an invalid judgment with
a valid one,â€ Wilkinson v. Dotson,544
U.Â S. 74 (Scalia, J., concurring), to a general grant
of supervisory authority over state trial courts.

															In a variation on the same theme, the dissent posits that, apart
from implied terms, a habeas petitioner who successfully defends a
judgment on an alternative ground has expanded his rights
under the judgment, because he has changed the
judgmentâ€™s issue-preclusive effects. This
theory confuses a partyâ€™s rights under a
judgmentâ€”here, the right to release,
resentencing, or commutation, at the Stateâ€™s
optionâ€”with preclusive effects that the
judgment might have in future proceedings. That makes nonsense of
American Railway. Whenever an appellee successfully
defends a judgment on an alternative ground, he changes what would
otherwise be the judgmentâ€™s issue-preclusive
effects. Thereafter, issue preclusion no longer attaches to the
ground on which the trial court decided the case, and instead
attaches to the alternative ground on which the appellate court
affirmed the judgment. Restatement (Second) of Judgments
Â§ 27 (1982). Thus, making alteration of
issue-preclusive effects the touchstone of necessity for
cross-appeal would require cross-appeal for every defense of
a judgment on alternative grounds. That is, of course, the polar
opposite of the rule we established in American Railway.

															Under the habeas courtâ€™s judgment, Jennings
was entitled, at the Stateâ€™s option, to either
release, resentencing, or commutation of his sentence. Any
potential claim that would have entitled Jennings to a new
sentencing proceeding could have been advanced to
â€œurge .Â .Â .
supportâ€ of the judgment within the meaning of
American Railway. 265 U.Â S., at 435. The dissent
and the State contend that applying American Railway in this
fashion will lead to a proliferation of frivolous appellate
defenses in habeas cases. If so, that is a problem that can only be
solved by Congress. Until it does so, we think it appropriate to
adhere to the usual law of appeals.

															We think, however, that the danger is exaggerated. To begin
with, not all defenses will qualify. A habeas applicant who has won
resentencing would be required to take a cross-appeal in order to
raise a rejected claim that would result in a new trial. Similarly,
even if a habeas applicant has won retrial below, a claim that his
conduct was constitutionally beyond the power of the State to
punish would require cross-appeal. And even a successful applicant
doing no more than defending his judgment on appeal is confined to
those alternative grounds present in the record: he may not
simply argue any alternative basis, regardless of its
origin. Ibid.

															Moreover, successful habeas applicants have an incentive to
defend their habeas grants effectively, an objective that is not
furthered by diverting an appellate courtâ€™s
attention from a meritorious defense to a frivolous one. The
dissent gives two examples of habeas petitioners who raised
numerous ostensibly frivolous claims. Post, at 9. They prove
nothing except the dissentâ€™s inability to
substantiate its claim that our holding will foster the
presentation of frivolous alternative grounds for affirmance. For
both examples involved habeas petitioners who lost before
the magistrate and were casting about for any basis that might
justify a writ. We are talking here about habeas petitioners who
have won before the district court. The notion that they can
often be expected to dilute their defense of the
(by-definition-nonfrivolous) basis for their victory by dragging in
frivolous alternative grounds to support it is thoroughly
implausible. Indeed, as the State and Jennings agree, it is rare
that a habeas petitioner successful in the district court will even
be called upon to defend his writ on appeal.

															And finally, we doubt that any more judicial time will be wasted
in rejection of frivolous claims made in defense of judgment on an
appeal already taken than would be wasted in rejection of similar
claims made in (what the State and dissent would require) a
separate proceeding for a certificate of appealability. To be sure,
as the dissent points out, post, at 9, the certificate
ruling will be made by just one judge rather than three; but that
judge will always be required to consider and rule on the
alternative grounds, whereas the three-judge court entertaining the
governmentâ€™s habeas appeal will not reach the
alternative grounds unless it rejects the ground relied on by the
lower court. Not to mention the fact that in an already-pending
appeal the court can give the back of its hand to frivolous claims
en passant, whereas the certificate process requires the
opening and disposition of a separate proceeding.

															In the end, the dissent tries to evade American Railway
by asserting that habeas corpus is
â€œunique.â€ Post, at 7. There
are undoubtedly some differences between writs of habeas corpus and
other judgmentsâ€”most notably, that habeas
proceedings traditionally ignored the claim-preclusive effect of
earlier adjudications. But the realitythat some things about
habeas are different does not mean that everything about
habeas is different. The dissent must justify why the particular
distinction it urges hereâ€”abandonment of the
usual American Railway ruleâ€”is an
appropriate one. It cannot.

															B

															The State also advances what could be termed a corollary to the
American Railway rule. Citing Helvering v.
Pfeiffer,302 U.Â S. 247 (1937), and Alexander
v. Cosden Pipe Line Co.,290 U.Â S. 484 (1934),
the State insists that a cross-appeal is necessary not only for
Jennings to enlarge his rights under the District
Courtâ€™s judgment, but also to attack the
District Courtâ€™s ruling rejecting his
Spisak theory, even if Jenningsâ€™ rights
under the courtâ€™s judgment would remain
undisturbed.

															The view of Pfeiffer and Alexander advanced by the
State would put these cases in considerable tension with our
oft-reaffirmed holding in American Railway. And it is not
the correct view. Both Pfeiffer and Alexander arose
from disputes between the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue
Service and taxpayers regarding multiple discrete federal tax
liabilities. Pfeiffer, supra, at 248;
Alexander, supra, at 486. In Pfeiffer, the
Commissioner prevailed before the Board of Tax Appeals on his
contention that a dividend was taxable, but lost a similar claim
against a cash payment. Only the taxpayer sought the Second
Circuitâ€™s review, and the taxpayer prevailed on
the dividend liability. 302 U.Â S., at 249. In
Alexander, the taxpayer sought refund of four tax
liabilities; the taxpayer won on all four. Only the Commissioner
appealed to the Tenth Circuit, and that court affirmed two of the
refunds, eliminated a third, and reduced a fourth. Pfeiffer,
supra, at 248â€“249; Alexander,
supra, at 486. The Commissioner sought our review in both
cases; we refused to entertain the
Commissionerâ€™s arguments regarding the cash
payment in Pfeiffer, or the taxpayerâ€™s
regarding the elimi-nated and reduced claims in Alexander,
citing American Railway.

															The State argues that these holdings expanded the need for
cross-appeal, beyond merely those arguments that would enlarge
rights under the judgment, to those arguments that revisit a lower
courtâ€™s disposition of an issue on which a
judgment rests. For, the State argues, the re-jected arguments
would not necessarily have expandedthe
Commissionerâ€™s or the
taxpayerâ€™s rights; if some of the points on
which the respective appellee won below were rejected on appeal,
his new arguments might do no more than preserve the amount
assessed.

															But this view of Pfeiffer and Alexander distorts
American Railway. American Railway does not merely
require a cross-appeal where a party, if fully successful on his
new arguments, would certainly obtain greater relief than provided
below; it requires cross-appeal if the partyâ€™s
arguments are presented â€œwith a view
either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or of lessening the
rights of his adversary.â€ 265 U.Â S., at
435. In Pfeiffer and Alexander the assertion of
additional tax liabilities or defenses, respectively, necessarily
sought to enlarge or to reduce the
Commissionerâ€™s rights, even if, under some
combination of issues affirmed and reversed, one possibility would
have produced no more than the same tax obligations pronounced by
the judgment below.

															Once we have rejected the
Stateâ€™sâ€”and
dissentâ€™sâ€”theories of
implied terms in conditional writs, Jenningsâ€™
Spisak theory sought the same relief awarded under his
Wiggins theories: a new sentencing hearing. Whether
prevailing on a single theory or all three, Jennings sought the
same, indivisible relief. This occurred in neither Pfeiffer
nor Alexander, and we decline to view those cases as
contradicting our
â€˜Â â€œinveterate and
certainâ€™Â â€ rule in
American Railway. Greenlaw v. United
States,554 U.Â S. 237,245 (2008).

															C

															Finally, the State urges that even if Jennings was not required
to take a cross-appeal by American Railway, Pfeiffer,
and Alexander, he was required to obtain a certificate of
appealability. We disagree.

															Section 2253(c) of Title 28 provides that â€œan
appeal may not be taken to the court of appealsâ€
without a certificate of appealability, which itself requires
â€œa substantial showing of the denial of a
constitutional right.â€ It is unclear whether this
requirement applies to a habeas petitioner seeking to cross-appeal
in a case that is already before a court of appeals. Section
2253(c) performs an important gate-keeping function, but once a
State has properly noticed an appeal of the grant of habeas relief,
the court of appeals must hear the case, and
â€œthere are no remaining gates to be
guarded.â€ Szabo v. Walls, 313
F.Â 3d 392, 398 (CA7 2002) (Easterbrook, J.).

															But we need not decide that question now, since it is clear that
Â§2253(c) applies only when â€œan
appealâ€ is â€œtaken to the court of
appeals.â€ Whether or not this embraces a cross-appeal,
it assuredly does not embrace the defense of a judgment on
alternative grounds. Congress enacted Â§2253(c) against
the well-known, if not entirely sharp, distinction between
defending a judgment on appeal and taking a cross-appeal. Nothing
in the statute justifies ignoring that distinction.

															The dissent laments that this result frustrates
AEDPAâ€™s purpose of preventing
â€œfrivolous appeals.â€ Post,
at 8. It can indulge that lament only by insisting that the defense
of an appealed judgment on alternative grounds is itself an appeal.
The two are not the same. The statutory text at issue here
addresses the â€œtak[ing]â€ of an
appeal, not â€œthe making of arguments in defense
of a judgment from which appeal has been taken.â€
Extending the certificate of appealability requirement from the
former to the latter is beyond the power of the courts.

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															Because Jenningsâ€™ Spisak theory would
neither have enlarged his rights nor diminished the
Stateâ€™s rights under the District
Courtâ€™s judgment, he was required neither to
take a cross-appeal nor to obtain a certificate of appealability.
We reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and remand the case
for consideration of Jenningsâ€™ Spisak
claim.

															It is so ordered.
