															ROMAN CATHOLIC DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN, NEW YORK v. ANDREW M. CUOMO, GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK

															on application for injunctive relief

															[November 25, 2020]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts, dissenting.

															I would not grant injunctive relief under the present circumstances.  There is simply no need to do so.  After the Diocese and Agudath Israel filed their applications, the Governor revised the designations of the affected areas.  None of the houses of worship identified in the applications is now subject to any fixed numerical restrictions.  At these locations, the applicants can hold services with up to 50% of capacity, which is at least as favorable as the relief they currently seek.

															Numerical capacity limits of 10 and 25 people, depending on the applicable zone, do seem unduly restrictive.  And it may well be that such restrictions violate the Free Exercise Clause.  It is not necessary, however, for us to rule on that serious and difficult question at this time.  The Governor might reinstate the restrictions.  But he also might not.  And it is a significant matter to override determinations made by public health officials concerning what is necessary for public safety in the midst of a deadly pandemic.  If the Governor does reinstate the numerical restrictions the applicants can return to this Court, and we could act quickly on their renewed applications.  As things now stand, however, the applicants have not demonstrated their entitlement to “the extraordinary remedy of injunction.”  Nken v. Holder,

556 U.S. 418, 428 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  An order telling the Governor not to do what he’s not doing fails to meet that stringent standard.

															As noted, the challenged restrictions raise serious concerns under the Constitution, and I agree with Justice Kavanaugh that they are distinguishable from those we considered in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 590 U. S. ___ (2020), and Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v. Sisolak, 591 U. S. ___ (2020).  See ante, at 1, 3–4 (concurring opinion).  I take a different approach than the other dissenting Justices in this respect.

															To be clear, I do not regard my dissenting colleagues as “cutting the Constitution loose during a pandemic,” yielding to “a particular judicial impulse to stay out of the way in times of crisis,” or “shelter[ing] in place when the Constitution is under attack.”  Ante, at 3, 5–6 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).  They simply view the matter differently after careful study and analysis reflecting their best efforts to fulfill their responsibility under the Constitution.

															One solo concurrence today takes aim at my concurring opinion in South Bay.  See ante, at 3–6 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).  Today’s concurrence views that opinion with disfavor because “[t]o justify its result, [it] reached back 100 years in the U. S. Reports to grab hold of our decision in Jacobson v. Massachusetts,

197 U.S. 11 (1905).”  Ante, at 3.  Today’s concurrence notes that Jacobson “was the first case South Bay cited on the substantive legal question before the Court,” and “it was the only case cited involving a pandemic.”  Ante, at 5.  And it suggests that, in the wake of South Bay, some have “mistaken this Court’s modest decision in Jacobson for a towering authority that overshadows the Constitution during a pandemic.”  Ibid.  But while Jacobson occupies three pages of today’s concurrence, it warranted exactly one sentence in South Bay.  What did that one sentence say?  Only that “[o]ur Constitution principally entrusts ‘[t]he safety and the health of the people’ to the politically accountable officials of the States ‘to guard and protect.’ ”  South Bay, 590 U. S., at ___ (Roberts, C. J., concurring) (quoting Jacobson, 197 U. S., at 38).  It is not clear which part of this lone quotation today’s concurrence finds so discomfiting.  The concurrence speculates that there is so much more to the sentence than meets the eye, invoking—among other interpretive tools—the new “first case cited” rule.  But the actual proposition asserted should be uncontroversial, and the concurrence must reach beyond the words themselves to find the target it is looking for.
