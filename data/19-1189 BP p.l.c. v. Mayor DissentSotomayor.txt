															BP P.L.C., et al., PETITIONERS v. MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[May 17, 2021]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, dissenting.

															Civil defendants in state court may remove a case to federal district court by asserting one or more bases for federal jurisdiction.  If the district court concludes that the case was improperly removed, it issues an order remanding the case back to state court.  For more than a century, the rule has been that such remand orders are generally not subject to appellate review.  See In re Pennsylvania Co.,

137 U.S. 451, 453–454 (1890).  This rule, codified at

28 U. S. C. §1447(d), “reflects Congress’s longstanding policy of not permitting interruption of the litigation of the merits of a removed case by prolonged litigation of questions of jurisdiction of the district court to which the cause is removed.”  Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc.,

551 U.S. 224, 238 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).

															Originally, there were no exceptions to §1447(d)’s bar on appellate review.  See §1447(d) (1946 ed., Supp. III).  Then, as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress created appellate jurisdiction over “ ‘order[s] remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1443,’ ” the civil rights removal statute.  §901,

78Stat.
266,

28 U. S. C. §1447(d) (1964 ed.).  In 2011, Congress extended this exception to cases removed pursuant to §1442, the federal officer removal statute.  See §1447(d) (2012 ed.).

															The Court today holds that a defendant who invokes either §1442 or §1443 when removing a case to federal court is entitled to appellate review of not just those grounds, but also any other grounds for removal the defendant asserts.  I disagree.  That interpretation lets defendants sidestep §1447(d)’s bar on appellate review by shoehorning a §1442 or §1443 argument into their case for removal.  In other words, it lets the exception swallow the rule.  Furthermore, when Congress amended §1447(d) to permit appellate review of decisions under §1442, every Court of Appeals to have addressed the question interpreted §1447(d) to permit appellate review of arguments under §1443 only, not of other arguments for removal addressed in the same order.  If Congress wanted to disturb that consensus, it would have said so.  I respectfully dissent.

															I

															Section 1447(d) permits appellate review of “an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1442 or 1443.”  Everyone agrees how this provision operates in two scenarios.  First, if a defendant removes a suit to federal court without invoking either §1442 or §1443, appellate courts may not review the district court’s remand order.  Second, if a defendant removes a suit solely under §1442 or §1443, appellate review is available for the remand order addressing that single ground for removal.

															But what if a defendant removes a case to federal court on multiple grounds, only one of which is §1442 or §1443?  Section 1447(d) does not speak clearly to that scenario.  In some statutes, Congress takes care to specify when it means “this and only this ground.”  See, e.g., §1446(b)(2)(A) (addressing civil actions “removed solely under section 1441(a)”).  Other times, Congress makes clear that reliance on a certain ground even “in part” will suffice.  See, e.g., §1295(a)(2) (providing for jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit over certain district court decisions “if the jurisdiction of that court was based, in whole or in part, on section 1346 of this title”).  Section 1447(d) contains neither kind of clarifying language, leaving uncertain how the provision applies to cases that are not removed under §1442 or §1443 alone.  See Board of Cty. Comm’rs of Boulder Cty. v. Suncor Energy (U. S. A.) Inc., 965 F.3d 792, 805 (CA10 2020) (Section 1447(d) “does not expressly contemplate the situation in which removal is done pursuant to one of these sections and other grounds” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

															There are three possible ways forward.  The first possibility is that §1447(d) permits appellate review of any asserted basis for removal so long as the suit was removed in part pursuant to §1442 or §1443.  That is the interpretation urged by petitioners and adopted by the Court today.  See ante, at 5–6.  The problem with this interpretation is that it stretches the exception in §1447(d) too far.  It allows defendants to bootstrap their entire case for removal into the court of appeals simply by tacking on an argument under §1442 or §1443.  Indeed, under this interpretation, a defendant could formally abandon its argument under §1442 or §1443 and seek an appeal exclusively of other grounds for removal.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34–36, 40–41.  That bizarre outcome, inexplicable in light of the manifest objective of limiting the exceptions in §1447(d), cautions heavily against this interpretation.

															Another possibility is that a suit removed pursuant to multiple grounds is not a suit removed pursuant to §1442 or §1443 at all, meaning no appellate review whatsoever is available under §1447(d).  For good reason, no one advocates this interpretation.  Such a rule would certainly avoid prolonged disputes about whether a case belongs in state or federal court, but only by denying appellate review for claims of jurisdiction under the federal-officer and civil-rights removal statutes.  That result is hard to square with Congress’ express directive that such claims get a second look.

															The third possibility is that §1447(d) allows appellate review of a defendant’s assertion of removal jurisdiction under the federal-officer or civil-rights removal statute alone.  Any other grounds for removal would remain subject to §1447(d)’s bar on appellate review.  This interpretation best accords with “Congress’s longstanding policy of not permitting interruption of the litigation of the merits of a removed case” with lengthy jurisdictional disputes, Powerex Corp., 551 U. S., at 238 (internal quotation marks omitted), while still allowing review of the two grounds Congress carved out for special treatment.  It also follows this Court’s usual policy of construing both statutory exceptions and procedures for removal narrowly.  See Maracich v. Spears,

570 U.S. 48, 60 (2013) (Statutory exceptions are to be “narrowly [construed] in order to preserve the primary operation of the provision” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. v. Henson,

537 U.S. 28, 32 (2002) (“[S]tatutory procedures for removal are to be strictly construed” out of respect for state sovereignty).

															Over the course of several decades, eight Courts of Appeals (every one to consider the question) adopted this third view of §1447(d).[1]*  See, e.g., Patel v. Del Taco, Inc., 446 F.3d 996, 998 (CA9 2006); Alabama v. Conley, 245 F.3d 1292, 1293, n. 1 (CA11 2001) (per curiam); Thornton v. Holloway, 70 F.3d 522, 524 (CA8 1995); State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Baasch, 644 F.2d 94, 96–97 (CA2 1981) (per curiam); Detroit Police Lieutenants and Sergeants Assn. v. Detroit, 597 F.2d 566, 567–568 (CA6 1979) (per curiam); Noel v. McCain, 538 F.2d 633, 635 (CA4 1976); Robertson v. Ball, 534 F.2d 63, 65–66 (CA5 1976) (per curiam); Pennsylvania ex rel. Gittman v. Gittman, 451 F.2d 155, 156–157 (CA3 1971) (per curiam).

															Congress legislated against the backdrop of this consensus when, in 2011, it amended §1447(d) to extend its  appellate-review exception, which previously applied to §1443 alone, to cover §1442 as well.  Critically, Congress did not amend the remainder of the provision.  Instead, it simply added the words “1442 or.”  See Removal Clarification Act,

125Stat.
546.  Had Congress disagreed with the settled interpretation of §1447(d), it presumably would have done something about it.

															The Court dismisses the possibility of congressional ratification by characterizing an unbroken line of decisions from two-thirds of the Courts of Appeals spanning nearly half a century as “a smattering of lower court opinions.”  Ante, at 11.  I would not assume that so many decisions reaching the same conclusion over such a long period were beneath Congress’ notice.  “ ‘If a word or phrase has been given a uniform interpretation by inferior courts, a later version of that act perpetuating the wording is presumed to carry forward that interpretation.’ ”  Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.,

576 U.S. 519, 536 (2015) (quoting A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 322 (2012); ellipses omitted).  That Congress did not disturb the prevailing interpretation of §1447(d) is a compelling reason this Court should not either.

															II

															The Court sees things differently.  In its view, it “does [not] matter” whether “a defendant removes a case ‘pursuant to’ multiple federal statutes” or just one.  Ante, at 5.  Either way, §1447(d) grants the court of appeals jurisdiction over the “order” remanding the case back to state court.  According to the Court, once the court of appeals takes jurisdiction over an order, it necessarily takes jurisdiction over all grounds for removal encompassed within it.

															In support of this theory, the Court looks to Yamaha Motor Corp., U. S. A. v. Calhoun,

516 U.S. 199 (1996).  That case concerned

28 U. S. C. §1292(b), a distinct statute that permits appellate review of an interlocutory “order not otherwise appealable” if the district court certifies that the order “involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.”  §1292(b).  Looking to “the text of §1292(b),” the Yamaha Court determined that, having taken jurisdiction over a §1292(b) order, a court of appeals may reach any issue fairly encompassed within it.  516 U. S., at 205.  In the Court’s view today, Yamaha means that appellate review of a remand order under §1447(d) must likewise be plenary.

															Yamaha does not do the work the Court says it does.  Section 1292(b) provides that an interlocutory order is appealable if it merely “involves” a certified issue.  There was thus no question in Yamaha that §1292(b) accounts for certified orders that address multiple issues, some of which are not “controlling question[s] of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.”  §1292(b).  Section 1447(d) lacks comparable language about what happens when a party removes a case on multiple grounds.  That is precisely what makes it ambiguous.

															The Court is left with the premise that appellate jurisdiction over an order (as with a judgment, decree, or sentence) usually means jurisdiction over all legal issues addressed within it.  Ante, at 5–6. I agree that this premise will often hold true.  But not always, as the Court itself recognizes.  See ante, at 9–10 (discussing Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590 (1875), and United States v. Keitel,

211 U.S. 370 (1908)).  Context matters.  To recap, in 1964, Congress created a limited exception for claims of removal under §1443 to what had long been an absolute prohibition on appellate review of remand orders.  After nearly half a century of courts interpreting that exception narrowly, Congress extended the exception to §1442 without otherwise amending §1447(d).  Section 1447(d) only unambiguously permits appellate review over remand orders that are based solely on one of those two grounds.  Granting defendants appellate review of other grounds of removal whenever they tack on an argument under §1442 or §1443 would allow the exception to trump the rule.  In these circumstances, the Court should seek an interpretation of §1447(d) that not only respects its carveout for arguments under §1442 and §1443 but also preserves its general bar on appellate review.

															III

															Unfortunately, I fear today’s decision will reward defendants for raising strained theories of removal under §1442 or §1443 by allowing them to circumvent the bar on appellate review entirely.  Look no further than this case.  In 2018, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore sued petitioners for allegedly concealing the connection between fossil fuels and climate change.  Petitioners listed eight grounds for removal to federal court, including §1442.  But petitioners now ask only for a ruling that removal was proper under §1441(a) (i.e., federal-question jurisdiction).  Had petitioners relied solely on §1441(a) before the District Court, as they do now, no one disputes their argument would be unreviewable on appeal.

															Not to worry, petitioners assure us: The threat of sanctions will sufficiently deter gamesmanship.  While sanctions help ward off egregious misconduct, they are no failsafe.  See, e.g., Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp.,

546 U.S. 132, 141 (2005) (“Absent unusual circumstances, courts may award attorney’s fees under §1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal”).  A federal-officer claim can be so weak it is not worth pursuing on appeal, but not so meritless as to warrant sanctions.  Again, look to this case.  Petitioners no longer advance their argument under §1442, calling it only “substantial.”  Brief for Petitioners 35.  Yet that argument somehow opens a back door to appellate review that would otherwise be closed to them.  Meanwhile, Baltimore, which has already waited nearly three years to begin litigation on the merits, is consigned to waiting once more.

															*  *  *

															Section 1447(d) places “broad restrictions on the power of federal appellate courts to review district court orders remanding removed cases to state court.”  Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca,

516 U.S. 124, 127 (1995).  After today’s decision, defendants can sidestep these restrictions by making near-frivolous arguments for removal under §1442 or §1443.  Congress, of course, can amend §1447(d) to make even clearer that appellate review of a district court remand order extends to only §1442 or §1443.  Because I believe §1447 already bears that meaning, I respectfully dissent.

*The Tenth Circuit had also reached this conclusion prior to Congress amending §1447(d), albeit in an unpublished opinion.  See Sanchez v. Onuska, 2 F.3d 1160 (Table), 1993 WL 307897, *1 (1993) (per curiam).  The Tenth Circuit has since reaffirmed that holding in a published opinion.  See Board of Cty. Comm’rs of Boulder Cty. v. Suncor Energy (U. S. A.) Inc., 965 F.3d 792, 802, n. 6 (2020).
