															LUIS A. NIEVES, et al., PETITIONERS v. RUSSELL P. BARTLETT

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 28, 2019]

															

															Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

															Arrest authority, as several decisions indicate, can be abused to disrupt the exercise of
 
First Amendment speech and press rights.  See, e.g., Lacey v. Maricopa County, 693 F.3d 896, 907–910 (CA9 2012) (en banc) (newspaper publishers alleged they were arrested in nighttime raid after publishing story on law enforcement’s investigation of the newspaper); Roper v. New York, 2017 WL 2483813, *1 (SDNY, June 7, 2017) (photographers documenting Black Lives Matter protest alleged they were arrested for standing in street and failing to use crosswalk; sidewalks and crosswalks were blocked by police); Morse v. San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. (BART), 2014 WL 572352, *1–*7 (ND Cal., Feb. 11, 2014) (only journalist arrested at protest was journalist critical of Bay Area Rapid Transit Police).  Given the array of laws proscribing, e.g., breach of the peace, disorderly conduct, obstructing public ways, failure to comply with a peace officer’s instruction, and loitering, police may justify an arrest as based on probable cause when the arrest was in fact prompted by a retalia- tory motive.  If failure to show lack of probable cause defeats an action under

42 U. S. C. §1983, only entirely baseless arrests will be checked.  I remain of the view that the Court’s decision in Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 

429 U.S. 274 (1977), strikes the right balance: The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that unconstitutional animus was a motivating factor for an adverse action; the burden then shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that, even without any impetus to retaliate, the defendant would have taken the action complained of.  See Hartman v. Moore,

547 U.S. 250, 266–267 (2006) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).

															In this case, I would reverse the Ninth Circuit’s judgment as to Trooper Weight.  As the Court points out, the record is bereft of evidence of retaliation on Weight’s part.  See ante, at 15.  As to Sergeant Nieves, there is some evidence of animus in Nieves’ statement, “bet you wish you would have talked to me now,” App. 376, but perhaps not enough to survive summary judgment.  Cf. Higginbotham v. Sylvester, 741 Fed. Appx. 28, 31 (CA2 2018) (“[A] reasonable factfinder could not find that [the plaintiff’s] exercise of his
 
First Amendment right . . . was the ‘but-for’ cause of his arrest.”).  In any event, I would not use this thin case to state a rule that will leave press members and others exercising
 
First Amendment rights with little protection against police suppression of their speech.
