															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 11–9540

															_________________

															MATTHEW ROBERT DESCAMPS, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 20, 2013]

															

															     Justice Kennedy,
concurring.

															     As the Court explains,
this case concerns earlier convictions under state statutes
classified by cases in the Courts of Appeals, and now in
today’s opinion for the Court, as “indivisible.”
See, e.g., United States v. Aguila-Montes de Oca, 655 F. 3d
915 (CA9 2011) (en banc) (per curiam); United States v.
Beardsley, 691 F. 3d 252 (CA2 2012). This category is used to
describe a class of criminal statutes that are drafted with a
single set of elements that are broader than those of the generic
definition of the corresponding crime enumerated in the Armed
Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S. C.
§924(e)(2)(B)(ii).

															     Just one of the
substantial concerns that the Court is correct to consider is that,
in the regular course of the criminal process, convictions may be
entered, often by guilty pleas, when either the attorney or the
client, or both, have given no consideration to possible later
consequences under ACCA. See ante, at 15–16. As a result,
certain facts in the documents approved for judicial examination in
Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13 (2005) , may go
uncontested because they do not alter the sentencing consequences
of the crime, even though their effect is to require a later
enhancement under ACCA. This significant risk of failing to
consider the full consequences of the plea and conviction is
troubling.

															     Balanced against this,
as Justice Alito indicates, is that the dichotomy between divisible
and indivisible state criminal statutes is not all that clear. See
post, at 12–13 (dissenting opinion). The effect of
today’s decision, more-over, is that an unspecified number,
but likely a large number, of state criminal statutes that are
indivisible but that often do reach serious crimes otherwise
subject to ACCA’s provisions, now must be amended by state
legislatures. Otherwise, they will not meet federal requirements
even though they would have come within ACCA’s terms had the
state statute been drafted in a different way. This is an intrusive
demand on the States.

															     On due consideration,
the concerns well expressed by the Court persuade me that it
reaches the correct result. The disruption to the federal policy
underlying ACCA, nevertheless, is troubling and substantial. See
post, at 13–14 (Alito, J., dissenting). If Congress wishes to
pursue its policy in a proper and efficient way without mandat- ing
uniformity among the States with respect to their criminal statutes
for scores of serious offenses, and without requiring the amendment
of any number of federal criminal statutes as well, Congress should
act at once. It may then determine whether ACCA’s design and
structure should be modified to meet the concerns expressed both by
the Court and the dissenting opinion.

															     With these
observations, I join the opinion of the Court.
