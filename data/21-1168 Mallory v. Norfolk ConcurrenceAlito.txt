															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															ROBERT MALLORY, PETITIONER v. NORFOLK
SOUTHERN RAILWAY CO.

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
pennsylvania, eastern district

															[June 27, 2023]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment.

															The sole question before us is whether the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a large
out-of-state corporation with substantial operations in a State
complies with a registration requirement that conditions the right
to do business in that State on the registrant’s submission
to personal jurisdiction in any suits that are brought there. I
agree with the Court that the answer to this question is no.
Assuming that the Constitution allows a State to impose such
a registration requirement, I see no reason to conclude that such
suits violate the corporation’s right to
“ ‘fair play and substantial
justice.’ ” International Shoe Co. v.
Washington, 326 U.S.
310, 316 (1945).

															I am not convinced, however, that the
Constitution permits a State to impose such a
submission-to-jurisdiction requirement. A State’s assertion
of jurisdiction over lawsuits with no real connection to the State
may violate fundamental principles that are protected by one or
more constitutional provisions or by the very structure of the
federal system that the Constitution created. At this point in the
development of our constitutional case law, the most appropriate
home for these principles is the so-called dormant Commerce Clause.
Norfolk Southern appears to have asserted a Commerce Clause claim
below, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did not address it. See
266 A.3d 542, 559–560, nn. 9, 11 (2021). Presumably,
Norfolk Southern can renew the challenge on remand. I therefore
agree that we should vacate the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s
judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.

															I

															When Virginia resident Robert Mallory
initiated this suit, Norfolk Southern Railway Company, a railroad
that was at that time incorporated and headquartered in Virginia,
had long operated rail lines and conducted related business in
Pennsylvania. Consistent with Pennsylvania law, the company had
registered as a “foreign” corporation, most recently in
1998. 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. §411(a) (2014); App. 1–2. Then,
as now, Pennsylvania law expressly provided that
“qualification as a foreign corporation” was a
“sufficient basis” for Pennsylvania courts “to
exercise general personal jurisdiction” over an out-of-state
company. 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. §5301(a)(2)(i) (2019). Norfolk
Southern is a sophisticated entity, and we may
“presum[e]” that it “acted with knowledge”
of state law when it registered. Commercial Mut. Accident
Co. v. Davis, 213 U.S.
245, 254 (1909). As a result, we may also presume that by
registering, it consented to all valid conditions imposed by state
law.

															I do not understand Norfolk Southern to
challenge this basic premise. Tr. of Oral Arg. 62 (acknowledging
that “the railroad understood by filing [registration
paperwork] that it was subject to [Pennsylvania’s general
jurisdiction] law”). Instead, Norfolk Southern argues that
giving force to the company’s consent would violate the
Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. See Power Mfg.
Co. v. Saunders, 274 U.S.
490, 496–497 (1927).

															That argument is foreclosed by our precedent. We
addressed this question more than a century ago in Pennsylvania
Fire Ins. Co. of Philadelphia v. Gold Issue Mining &
Milling Co., 243 U.S.
93 (1917). There, an Arizona mining company sued a Pennsylvania
insurance company in a Missouri court, alleging claims arising from
events in Colorado. Id., at 94. The Pennsylvania insurance
company had “obtained a license to do business in
Missouri,” and so had complied with a Missouri statute
requiring the company to execute a power of attorney consenting to
service of process on the state insurance superintendent in
exchange for licensure. Ibid. The Missouri Supreme Court had
previously construed such powers of attorney as consent to
jurisdiction in Missouri for all claims, including those arising
from transactions outside the State. Gold Issue Mining &
Milling Co. v. Pennsylvania Fire Ins. Co. of
Philadelphia, 267 Mo. 524, 549–550, 184 S.W. 999,
1003–1005 (1916) (citing State ex rel. Pacific Mut.
Life Ins. Co. v. Grimm, 239 Mo. 135, 159–171, 143
S.W. 483, 490–494 (1911)). Because the insurance company had
executed the power of attorney to obtain its license, the court
held that Missouri had jurisdiction over the company in that suit.
267 Mo., at 610, 184 S. W., at 1024. We affirmed in a brief
opinion, holding that the construction of Missouri’s statute
and its application to the Pennsylvania insurance company under the
circumstances of the case did not violate due process.
Pennsylvania Fire, 243 U. S., at 95.

															The parallels between Pennsylvania Fire
and the case before us are undeniable. In both, a large company
incorporated in one State was actively engaged in business in
another State. In connection with that business, both companies
took steps that, under the express terms or previous authoritative
construction of state law, were understood as consent to the
State’s jurisdiction in suits on all claims, no matter where
the events underlying the suit took place. In both cases, an
out-of-state plaintiff sued the out-of-state company, alleging
claims unrelated to the company’s forum-state conduct. And in
both, the out-of-state company objected, arguing that holding it to
the terms of its consent would violate the Fourteenth
Amendment’s Due Process Clause. In Pennsylvania Fire,
we held that there was no due process violation in these
circumstances. Given the near-complete overlap of material facts,
that holding, unless it has been overruled, is binding here.

															Norfolk Southern has not persuaded me that
Pennsylvania Fire has been overruled. While we have
infrequently invoked that decision’s due process holding, we
have never expressly overruled it. Nor can I conclude that it has
been impliedly overruled. See post, at 15–16 (Barrett,
J., dissenting). Norfolk Southern cites the International
Shoe line of cases, but those cases involve constitutional
limits on jurisdiction over non-consenting corporations. See
International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 317; Goodyear
Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v. Brown, 564 U.S.
915, 927–928 (2011); Daimler AG v. Bauman,
571 U.S.
117, 129 (2014); BNSF R. Co. v. Tyrrell, 581
U.S. 402, 415 (2017) (declining to consider defendant’s
alleged consent because court below did not reach it). Consent is a
separate basis for personal jurisdiction. Insurance Corp. of
Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S.
694, 703 (1982); Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz,
471 U.S.
462, 472, n. 14 (1985); J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd.
v. Nicastro, 564 U.S.
873, 880–881 (2011) (plurality opinion). Pennsylvania
Fire’s holding, insofar as it is predicated on the
out-of-state company’s consent, is not
“inconsistent” with International Shoe or its
progeny. Shaffer v. Heitner, 433
U.S. 186, 212, n. 39 (1977).

															Nor would I overrule Pennsylvania Fire in
this case, as Norfolk Southern requests. At the least,
Pennsylvania Fire’s holding does not strike me as
“egregiously wrong” in its application here.
Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020)
(Kavanaugh, J., concurring in part) (slip op., at 7). Requiring
Norfolk Southern to defend against Mallory’s suit in
Pennsylvania, as opposed to in Virginia, is not so deeply unfair
that it violates the railroad’s constitutional right to due
process. International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 316. The
company has extensive operations in Pennsylvania, 266 A. 3d,
at 562–563; see also ante, at 17–20; has availed
itself of the Pennsylvania courts on countless occasions, Brief for
Academy of Rail Labor Attorneys as Amicus Curiae 4–5
(collecting cases); and had clear notice that Pennsylvania
considered its registration as consent to general jurisdiction, 15
Pa. Cons. Stat. §411(a); 42 Pa. Cons. Stat.
§5301(a)(2)(i). Norfolk Southern’s “conduct and
connection with [Pennsylvania] are such that [it] should reasonably
anticipate being haled into court there.” World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444
U.S. 286, 297 (1980).

															If having to defend this suit in Pennsylvania
seems unfair to Norfolk Southern, it is only because it is hard to
see Mallory’s decision to sue in Philadelphia as anything
other than the selection of a venue that is reputed to be
especially favorable to tort plaintiffs.[1] But we have never held that the Due Process Clause
protects against forum shopping. Perhaps for that understandable
reason, no party has suggested that we go so far.

															For these reasons, I agree that Pennsylvania
Fire controls our decision here, but I stress that it does so
due to the clear overlap with the facts of this case.

															II

															A

															While that is the end of the case before us,
it is not the end of the story for registration-based jurisdiction.
We have long recognized that the Constitution restricts a
State’s power to reach out and regulate conduct that has
little if any connection with the State’s legitimate
interests. This principle, an “obviou[s]” and
“necessary result” of our constitutional order, is not
confined to any one clause or section, but is expressed in the very
nature of the federal system that the Constitution created and in
numerous provisions that bear on States’ interactions with
one another. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Head,
234 U.S.
149, 161 (1914).[2]

															The dissent suggests that we apply this
principle through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, post, at 6–8, and there is support for this
argument in our case law, if not in the ordinary meaning of the
provision’s wording. By its terms, the Due Process Clause is
about procedure, but over the years, it has become a refuge of
sorts for constitutional principles that are not
“procedural” but would otherwise be homeless as the
result of having been exiled from the provisions in which they may
have originally been intended to reside. This may be true, for
example, with respect to the protection of substantive rights that
might otherwise be guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment’s
Privileges and Immunities Clause. See McDonald v.
Chicago, 561 U.S.
742, 754–759 (2010) (plurality opinion); id., at
808–812 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). And in a somewhat similar way, our due process decisions
regarding personal jurisdiction have often invoked respect for
federalism as a factor in their analyses.

															In our first decision holding that the
Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause protects a civil
defendant from suit in certain fora, the Court proclaimed that
“no State can exercise direct jurisdiction and authority over
persons or property without its territory.” Pennoyer
v. Neff, 95 U.S.
714, 722 (1878). “The several States,” the Court
explained, “are of equal dignity and authority, and the
independence of one implies the exclusion of power from all
others.” Ibid. The Court warned that, in certain
circumstances, a State’s exercise of jurisdiction over
non-residents would be “an encroachment upon the independence
of [another] State” and a “usurpation” of that
State’s authority. Id., at 723. And the Court noted
that this was not a newly-developed doctrine, but reflected
“well-established principles of public law” that
“ha[d] been frequently expressed . . . in opinions
of eminent judges, and . . . carried into adjudications
in numerous cases.” Id., at 722, 724; see,
e.g., D’Arcy v. Ketchum, 11 How. 165,
176 (1851); Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 612 (No.
11,134) (CC Mass. 1828) (Story, J.).

															Our post-International Shoe decisions
have continued to recognize that constitutional restrictions on
state court jurisdiction “are more than a guarantee of
immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation,” but
reflect “territorial limitations” on state power.
Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S.
235, 251 (1958); see also World-Wide Volkswagen, 444
U. S., at 292 (in addition to “protect[ing] the
defendant against the burdens of litigating in a distant or
inconvenient forum,” due process “acts to ensure that
the States, through their courts, do not reach out beyond the
limits imposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in a
federal system”); id., at 293 (“The sovereignty
of each State . . . implie[s] a limitation on the
sovereignty of all of its sister States—a limitation express
or implicit in both the original scheme of the Constitution and the
Fourteenth Amendment”); J. McIntyre Machinery,
564 U. S., at 884 (plurality opinion) (if a “State were
to assert jurisdiction in an inappropriate case, it would upset the
federal balance, which posits that each State has a sovereignty
that is not subject to unlawful intrusion by other States”).
And we have recognized that in some circumstances,
“federalism interest[s] may be decisive” in the due
process analysis. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior
Court of Cal., San Francisco Cty., 582 U.S. 255, 263
(2017).

															Despite these many references to federalism in
due process decisions, there is a significant obstacle to
addressing those concerns through the Fourteenth Amendment here: we
have never held that a State’s assertion of jurisdiction
unconstitutionally intruded on the prerogatives of another State
when the defendant had consented to jurisdiction in the forum
State. Indeed, it is hard to see how such a decision could be
justified. The Due Process Clause confers a right on
“person[s],” Amdt. 14, §1, not States. If a person
voluntarily waives that right, that choice should be honored. See
Insurance Corp. of Ireland, 456 U. S., at 703;
ante, at 2–3 (Jackson, J., concurring).

															The federalism concerns that this case
presents fall more naturally within the scope of the Commerce
Clause.[3] “By its terms,
the Commerce Clause grants Congress the power ‘[t]o regulate
Commerce . . . among the several
States.’ ” Raymond Motor Transp., Inc. v.
Rice, 434 U.S.
429, 440 (1978) (quoting Art. I, §8, cl. 3). But this
Court has long held that the Clause includes a negative component,
the so-called dormant Commerce Clause, that “prohibits state
laws that unduly restrict interstate commerce.” Tennessee
Wine and Spirits Retailers Assn. v. Thomas, 588
U. S. ___, ___–___ (2019) (slip op., at 6–7); see,
e.g., Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of
Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots, 12
How. 299, 318–319 (1852); Willson v. Black Bird
Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245, 252 (1829).

															While the notion that the Commerce Clause
restrains States has been the subject of “thoughtful
critiques,” the concept is “deeply rooted in our case
law,” Tennessee Wine, 588 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 7), and vindicates a fundamental aim of the Constitution:
fostering the creation of a national economy and avoiding the
every-State-for-itself practices that had weakened the country
under the Articles of Confederation. See Hughes v.
Oklahoma, 441 U.S.
322, 325–326 (1979); Healy v. Beer
Institute, 491 U.S.
324, 335–336 (1989). The Framers “might have
thought [that other provisions] would fill that role,” but
“at this point in the Court’s history, no provision
other than the Commerce Clause could easily do the job.”
Tennessee Wine, 588 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
8).[4]

															In its negative aspects, the Commerce Clause
serves to “mediate [the States’] competing claims of
sovereign authority” to enact regulations that affect
commerce among the States. National Pork Producers Council
v. Ross, 598 U. S. ___, ___ (2023) (slip op., at 14).
The doctrine recognizes that “one State’s power to
impose burdens on . . . interstate market[s]
. . . is not only subordinate to the federal power over
interstate commerce, but is also constrained by the need to respect
the interests of other States.” BMW of North America,
Inc. v. Gore, 517
U.S. 559, 571 (1996) (citing Gibbons v. Ogden, 9
Wheat. 1, 194–196 (1824)). It is especially appropriate to
look to the dormant Commerce Clause in considering the
constitutionality of the authority asserted by Pennsylvania’s
registration scheme. Because the right of an out-of-state
corporation to do business in another State is based on the dormant
Commerce Clause, it stands to reason that this doctrine may also
limit a State’s authority to condition that right. See
Granholm v. Heald, 544 U.S.
460, 472 (2005); H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du
Mond, 336 U.S.
525, 539 (1949).

															This Court and other courts have long examined
assertions of jurisdiction over out-of-state companies in light of
interstate commerce concerns.[5] Consider Davis v. Farmers Co-operative Equity
Co., 262 U.S.
312 (1923), a case very much like the one now before us. In
Davis, a Kansas company sued a Kansas railroad in Minnesota
on a claim that was “in no way connected with
Minnesota.” Id., at 314. Jurisdiction over the
railroad was based on its compliance with a state statute
regulating the in-state activities of out-of-state corporations:
the railroad maintained a soliciting agent in Minnesota, and the
Minnesota Supreme Court had interpreted state law as compelling
out-of-state carriers, as a “condition of maintaining a
soliciting agent,” to “submit to suit” in
Minnesota on any “cause of action, wherever it may have
arisen.” Id., at 315.

															The Minnesota Supreme Court upheld jurisdiction
against the railroad, but we reversed, holding that
Minnesota’s condition “impos[ed] upon interstate
commerce a serious and unreasonable burden, which renders the
statute obnoxious to the [C]ommerce [C]lause.” Ibid.
“By requiring from interstate carriers general submission to
suit,” Minnesota’s statute “unreasonably
obstruct[ed], and unduly burden[ed], interstate commerce.”
Id., at 317.[6]

															Although we have since refined our Commerce
Clause framework, the structural constitutional principles
underlying these decisions are unchanged, and the Clause remains a
vital constraint on States’ power over out-of-state
corporations.

															C

															In my view, there is a good prospect that
Pennsylvania’s assertion of jurisdiction here—over an
out-of-state company in a suit brought by an out-of-state plaintiff
on claims wholly unrelated to Pennsylvania—violates the
Commerce Clause.

															Under our modern framework, a state law may
offend the Commerce Clause’s negative restrictions in two
circumstances: when the law discriminates against interstate
commerce or when it imposes “undue burdens” on
interstate commerce. South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.,
585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 7). Discriminatory
state laws are subject to “ ‘a virtually per
se rule of invalidity.’ ” Ibid.
(quoting Granholm, 544 U. S., at 476). “[O]nce a
state law is shown to discriminate against interstate commerce
‘either on its face or in practical
effect,’ ” the law’s proponent must
“demonstrate both that the statute ‘serves a legitimate
local purpose,’ and that this purpose could not be served as
well by available nondiscriminatory means.” Maine v.
Taylor, 477 U.S.
131, 138 (1986). Justification of a discriminatory law faces a
“high” bar to overcome the presumption of invalidity.
New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U.S.
269, 278 (1988). Laws that
“ ‘even-handedly’ ” regulate to
advance “ ‘a legitimate local public
interest’ ” are subject to a looser standard.
Wayfair, 585 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). These laws
will be upheld “ ‘unless the burden imposed on
[interstate] commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the
putative local benefits.’ ” Ibid. In these
circumstances, “ ‘the question becomes one of
degree,’ ” and “ ‘the extent of
the burden that will be tolerated will . . . depend on
the nature of the local interest involved.’ ”
Raymond Motor Transp., 434 U. S., at 441. See also
Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397
U.S. 137, 142 (1970).

															There is reason to believe that
Pennsylvania’s registration-based jurisdiction law
discriminates against out-of-state companies.[7] But at the very least, the law imposes a
“significant burden” on interstate commerce by
“[r]equiring a foreign corporation . . . to defend
itself with reference to all transactions,” including those
with no forum connection. Bendix Autolite Corp. v.
Midwesco Enterprises, Inc., 486 U.S.
888, 893 (1988); see, e.g., Davis, 262
U. S., at 315–317 (burden in these circumstances is
“serious and unreasonable,” “heavy,” and
“undu[e]”); Michigan Central R. Co. v.
Mix, 278
U.S. 492, 495 (1929) (burden is “heavy”); Denver
& Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Terte, 284 U.S.
284, 287 (1932) (burden is “serious”); Atchison,
T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Wells, 265
U.S. 101, 103 (1924) (jurisdiction “interfered
unreasonably with interstate commerce”).

															The foreseeable consequences of the law make
clear why this is so. Aside from the operational burdens it places
on out-of-state companies, Pennsylvania’s scheme injects
intolerable unpredictability into doing business across state
borders. Large companies may be able to manage the patchwork of
liability regimes, damages caps, and local rules in each State, but
the impact on small companies, which constitute the majority of all
U. S. corporations, could be devastating.[8] Large companies may resort to creative
corporate structuring to limit their amenability to suit. Small
companies may prudently choose not to enter an out-of-state market
due to the increased risk of remote litigation. Some companies may
forgo registration altogether, preferring to risk the consequences
rather than expand their exposure to general jurisdiction.
“No one benefits from this ‘efficient breach’ of
corporate-registration laws”: corporations must manage their
added risk, and plaintiffs face challenges in serving unregistered
corporations. Brief for Tanya Monestier as Amicus Curiae 16.
States, meanwhile, “would externalize the costs of [their]
plaintiff-friendly regimes.” Brief for Stephen E. Sachs as
Amicus Curiae 26.

															Given these serious burdens, to survive Commerce
Clause scrutiny under this Court’s framework, the law must
advance a “ ‘legitimate local public
interest’ ” and the burdens must not be
“ ‘clearly excessive in relation to the putative
local benefits.’ ” Wayfair, 585 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 7). But I am hard-pressed to identify any
legitimate local interest that is advanced by
requiring an out-of-state company to defend a suit brought by an
out-of-state plaintiff on claims wholly unconnected to the forum
State. A State certainly has a legitimate interest in regulating
activities conducted within its borders, which may include
providing a forum to redress harms that occurred within the State.
State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell,
538 U.S.
408, 422 (2003); BMW of North America, 517 U. S.,
at 568–569; Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S.
352, 356 (1927). A State also may have an interest “in
providing its residents with a convenient forum for redressing
injuries inflicted by out-of-state actors.” Burger
King, 471 U. S., at 473. But a State generally does
not have a legitimate local interest in vindicating the
rights of non-residents harmed by out-of-state actors through
conduct outside the State. See, e.g., Edgar v.
MITE Corp., 457 U.S.
624, 644 (1982). With no legitimate local interest served,
“there is nothing to be weighed . . . to sustain
the law.” Ibid. And even if some legitimate local
interest could be identified, I am skeptical that any local
benefits of the State’s assertion of jurisdiction in these
circumstances could overcome the serious burdens on interstate
commerce that it imposes. See, e.g., id., at
643–646; Raymond Motor Transp., 434 U. S., at
444–446.

															*  *  *

															Because Pennsylvania Fire resolves this
case in favor of petitioner Mallory and no Commerce Clause
challenge is before us, I join the Court’s opinion as stated
in Parts I and III–B, and agree that the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court’s judgment should be vacated and the case remanded for
further proceedings.

 Analyzing these concerns
under the Commerce Clause has the additional advantage of allowing
Congress to modify the degree to which States should be able to
entertain suits involving out-of-state parties and conduct. If
Congress disagrees with our judgment on this question, it
“has the authority to change the . . . rule”
under its own Commerce power, subject, of course, to any other
relevant constitutional limit. South Dakota v. Wayfair,
Inc., 585 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (slip op., at
17–18); see also Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex
rel. Sullivan, 325 U.S.
761, 769–770 (1945).

 In the past, the Court
recognized that the Import-Export Clause, Art. I, §10, cl. 2,
and the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Art. IV, §2, might
restrict state regulations that interfere with the national
economy. See, e.g., Brown v. Maryland, 12
Wheat. 419, 445–449 (1827) (reading Import-Export Clause to
prohibit state laws imposing duties on “importations from a
sister State”); Almy v. California, 24 How.
169, 175 (1861) (applying Import-Export Clause to invalidate state
law taxing gold and silver shipments between States); Toomer
v. Witsell, 334 U.S.
385, 396, and n. 26 (1948) (observing that the Privileges
and Immunities Clause guarantees out-of-state citizens the right to
do business in a State on equal terms with state citizens (citing
Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418 (1871))). But the
Court has since narrowed the scope of these provisions. See
Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 136–137 (1869)
(holding that the Import-Export Clause applies only to
international trade); Western & Southern Life Ins. Co.
v. State Bd. of Equalization of Cal., 451 U.S.
648, 656 (1981) (observing that “the Privileges and
Immunities Clause is inapplicable to corporations” (citing
Hemphill v. Orloff, 277 U.S.
537, 548–550 (1928))). Whether or not these restrictive
interpretations are correct as an original matter, they are
entrenched. Unless we overrule them, we must look elsewhere if
“a national economic union unfettered by state-imposed
limitations on commerce” is to be preserved. Healy,
491 U. S., at 336.

 Because we resolved the
case under the Commerce Clause, we declined to consider the
railroad’s Fourteenth Amendment challenges. Davis v.
Farmers Co-operative Equity Co., 262
U.S. 312, 318 (1923).

 See, e.g., J.
Preis, The Dormant Commerce Clause as a Limit on Personal
Jurisdiction, 102 Iowa L. Rev. 138–140 (2016). A state
law discriminates against interstate commerce if its
“ ‘practical effect’ ” is to
disadvantage out-of-state companies to the benefit of in-state
competitors. Maine v. Taylor, 477
U.S. 131, 138 (1986); see United Haulers Assn., Inc. v.
Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U.S.
330, 338 (2007). Pennsylvania’s law seems to discriminate
against out-of-state companies by forcing them to increase their
exposure to suits on all claims in order to access
Pennsylvania’s market while Pennsylvania companies generally
face no reciprocal burden for expanding operations into another
State.
