															Second.  That the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in and by its Legislative Act approved November 21, 1788, in Chapter 23 of the Laws and Resolutions of the Session of 1788-1789, did duly grant and convey to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham the lands and premises which are known in this case and generally known as the Phelps and
