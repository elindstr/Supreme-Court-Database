SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 08-1555





															MOHAMED ALI SAMANTAR, PETITIONER v. BASHE ABDI YOUSUF et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 1, 2010]



															   Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															
   I join the Court’s opinion except for those parts relying on the legislative history of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. §§1330, 1602, et seq.  In my view, the Court’s textual analysis is sufficient to re-
solve this case.  See post, at 1–4 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).
