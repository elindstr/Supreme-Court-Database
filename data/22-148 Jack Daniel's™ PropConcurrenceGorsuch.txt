															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															JACK DANIEL’S PROPERTIES, INC.,
PETITIONER v. VIP PRODUCTS LLC

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 8, 2023]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Thomas and
Justice Barrett join, concurring.

															I am pleased to join the Court’s opinion.
I write separately only to underscore that lower courts should
handle Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994 (CA2 1989),
with care. Today, the Court rightly concludes that, even taken on
its own terms, Rogers does not apply to cases like the one
before us. But in doing so, we necessarily leave much about
Rogers unaddressed. For example, it is not entirely clear
where the Rogers test comes from—is it commanded by
the First Amendment, or is it merely gloss on the Lanham Act,
perhaps inspired by constitutional-avoidance doctrine? Id.,
at 998. For another thing, it is not obvious that Rogers is
correct in all its particulars—certainly, the Solicitor
General raises serious questions about the decision. See Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 23–28. All this remains
for resolution another day, ante, at 13, and lower courts
should be attuned to that fact.
