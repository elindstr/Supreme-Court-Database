															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–227

															_________________

															LAC du FLAMBEAU BAND OF LAKE SUPERIOR CHIPPEWA
INDIANS, et al., PETITIONERS v. BRIAN W. COUGHLIN

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the first circuit

															[June 15, 2023]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in the
judgment.

															As I have explained, to the extent that tribes
possess sovereign immunity at all, that immunity does not extend to
“suits arising out of a tribe’s commercial activities
conducted beyond its territory.” Michigan v. Bay
Mills Indian Community, 572 U.S.
782, 815 (2014) (dissenting opinion). Because
respondent’s stay-enforcement motion arose from
petitioners’ off-reservation commercial conduct, petitioners
lack sovereign immunity regardless of the Bankruptcy Code’s
abrogation provision. I therefore concur in the Court’s
judgment.

															“Tribal immunity is a judicial doctrine
that is not mandated by the Constitution, . . . developed
almost by accident, was reiterated with little analysis, and does
not reflect the realities of modern-day Indian tribes.”
Upper Skagit Tribe v. Lundgren, 584 U. S. ___,
___ (2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12) (internal
quotation marks omitted). To the extent that tribes have any
sovereign immunity at all, it is a common-law immunity. Bay
Mills, 572 U. S., at 816–817. Unlike the sovereign
immunity enjoyed by the States under the Constitution, common-law
immunity “is not a freestanding right that applies of its own
force when a sovereign faces suit in the courts of another.”
Id., at 816 (in- ternal quotation marks omitted). Rather, it
“normally depends on the second sovereign’s law”
as a matter of comity. Ibid. (internal quotation marks
omitted). Because no federal law accords tribes sovereign immunity
in federal court, petitioners lack immunity in this federal
case.

															Moreover, even if federal courts could afford
immunity to tribes as a matter of comity, comity considerations
would not help petitioners. “Even with respect to fully
sovereign foreign nations, comity has long been discarded as a
sufficient reason to grant immunity for commercial
acts”—like those at issue here. Id., at 817
(emphasis added). And, far from furthering comity principles,
recognizing immunity for off-reservation commercial acts
“represents a substantial affront to a different set of
sovereigns—the States.” Ibid. When a tribe
engages in off-reservation commercial activity, “it
necessarily acts within the territory of a sovereign State.”
Id., at 818. Thus, to grant tribes a unique and unjustified
immunity from both federal and state jurisdiction for commercial
acts committed on a State’s territory “aggravate[s]
relationships between States and tribes throughout the
country.” Id., at 818–819. Accordingly, any
common-law immunity that petitioners possess cannot support their
claim to immunity in federal court for their off-reservation
commercial conduct.

															The Court’s tribal immunity doctrine is
also out of step with more recent decisions. In Franchise Tax
Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, 587 U. S. ___ (2019), the
Court recognized that the 50 States possess a unique form of
immunity that applies of its own force in the courts of sister
States, id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 7–16), as
well as those of the Federal Government, id., at ___ (slip
op., at 12) (collecting cases). This immunity stems from the
Constitution itself and belongs only to the 50 States through their
ratification of the Constitution or admission to the Union on an
equal footing with the original States. See Alden v.
Maine, 527 U.S.
706, 713 (1999). As a result, it is distinct from common-law
immunity, which depends upon the forum court’s sovereign for
recognition. Bay Mills, 572 U. S., at 816. By treating
tribal immunity like state immunity, the Court’s tribal
immunity case law has afforded tribes, by judicial fiat, a form of
immunity that the Constitution accords to the 50 States, and only
the 50 States.

															Finally, this Court’s tribal immunity
doctrine continues to artificially exempt tribes from generally
applicable laws. I warned nearly a decade ago that tribal immunity
“will continue to invite problems, including de facto
deregulation of highly regulated activities; unfairness to tort
victims; and increasingly fractious relations with States and
individuals alike.” Id., at 825. This is a case in
point. In order to avoid state payday loan regulation,
“payday lenders . . . often arrange to share fees
or profits with tribes so they can use tribal immunity as a shield
for conduct of questionable legality.” Ibid.
Petitioners here rely on tribal immunity to avoid not only state
but also federal payday loan regulation. They further seek to
leverage this immunity to pursue respondent on his debt while other
creditors’ collection efforts are stayed. Tribal immunity
thus creates a pathway to circumvent vast swaths of both state and
federal laws.

															The consequences of the Court’s erroneous
tribal immunity precedents have only gotten worse over the years.
See id., at 814 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“I am now
convinced that [Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing
Technologies, Inc., 523 U.S.
751 (1998)] was wrongly decided; that, in the intervening 16
years, its error has grown more glaringly obvious; and that
stare decisis does not recommend its retention”);
id., at 831 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (“[T]his
Court’s declaration of an immunity thus absolute was and
remains exorbitant”). Further, the doctrine simply cannot be
reconciled with the Court’s precedents affirming “that
the States have legislative jurisdiction over the off-reservation
conduct of Indian tribes, and even over some on-reservation
activities.” Kiowa, 523 U. S., at 762 (Stevens,
J., dissenting) (describing the Court’s prior cases). Rather
than accepting the flawed premise of tribal immunity and deciding
the abrogation question beyond the looking glass, the Court should
simply abandon its judicially created tribal sovereign immunity
doctrine.
