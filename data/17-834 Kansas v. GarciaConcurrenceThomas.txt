															 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															KANSAS, PETITIONER

															v.

															RAMIRO GARCIA

															

															KANSAS, PETITIONER

															v.

															DONALDO MORALES

															

															KANSAS, PETITIONER

															v.

															GUADALUPE OCHOA-LARA

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of kansas

															[March 3, 2020]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring.

															I agree that Kansas’ prosecutions and convictions of respondents for identity theft and making false information are not pre-empted by §101(a)(1) of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986,

8 U. S. C. §1324a.  I write  separately to reiterate my view that we should explicitly abandon our “purposes and objectives” pre-emption  jurisprudence.

															The founding generation treated conflicts between federal and state laws as implied repeals.  PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing,

564 U.S. 604, 622 (2011) (plurality opinion).  Then, as now, courts disfavored repeals by implication.  See, e.g., Warder v. Arell, 2 Va. 282, 299 (1796) (opinion of President

															 

															Judge); 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law- Dictionary (2d ed. 1771) (defining “Statute”); 4 M. Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law 638 (3d ed. 1768).  To overcome this disfavor, legislatures included non obstante clauses in statutes.  See Nelson, Preemption, 86 Va. L. Rev. 225, 237–240, and nn. 42–44 (2000) (collecting examples).  Courts understood non obstante provisions to mean that, “[r]ather than straining the new statute in order to harmonize it with prior law, [they] were supposed to give the new statute its natural meaning and to let the chips fall where they may.”  Id., at 242.

															The Founders included a non obstante provision in the Supremacy Clause.  It directs that “the Judges in every State shall be bound” by the “Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any state to the Contrary notwithstanding.”  Art. VI, cl. 2.  If we interpret the Supremacy Clause as the founding generation did, our task is straightforward.  We must use the accepted methods of interpretation to ascertain whether the ordinary meaning of federal and state law “directly conflict.”  Wyeth v. Levine,

555 U.S. 555, 590 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  “[F]ederal law pre-empts state law only if the two are in logical contradiction.”  Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. Albrecht, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2); see also Nelson, supra, at 236–237.

															 The doctrine of “purposes and objectives” pre-emption impermissibly rests on judicial guesswork about “broad federal policy objectives, legislative history, or generalized notions of congressional purposes that are not contained within the text of federal law.”  Wyeth, supra, at 587 (opinion of Thomas, J.); see also Arizona v. United States,

567 U.S. 387, 440 (2012) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  I therefore cannot apply “purposes and objectives” pre-emption doctrine, as it is contrary to the Supremacy Clause.[1]*

															In these cases, the Court correctly distinguishes our “purposes and objectives” precedents and does not engage in a “ ‘freewheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in tension with federal objectives.’ ”  Wyeth, supra, at 588 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC,

544 U.S. 431, 459 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part)).  It also acknowledges that “[t]he Supremacy Clause gives priority to ‘the laws of the United States,’ not the criminal law enforcement priorities or preferences of federal officers.”  Ante, at 19.  Because the Court rejects respondents’ “purposes and objectives” argument without atextual speculation about legislative intentions, I join its opinion in full.
Notes
1
*I am also skeptical of field pre-emption, “at least as applied in the absence of a congressional command that a particular field be pre-empted.”  Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison,

520 U.S. 564, 617 (1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  For today, however, it suffices to say that the Court correctly applies our field pre-emption precedents and that “nothing in the text of the relevant federal statutes indicates that Congress intended” to pre-empt a pertinent field.  Arizona, 567 U. S., at 439 (opinion of Thomas, J.).
