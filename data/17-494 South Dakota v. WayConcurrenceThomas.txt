															SOUTH DAKOTA, PETITIONER v. WAYFAIR, INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of  south dakota

															[June 21, 2018]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															Justice Byron White joined the majority opinion in National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill.,

386 U. S. 753 (1967).  Twenty-five years later, we had the opportunity to overrule Bellas Hess in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota,

504 U. S. 298 (1992).  Only Justice White voted to do so.  See id., at 322 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  I should have joined his opinion.  Today, I am slightly further removed from Quill than Justice White was from Bellas Hess.  And like Justice White, a quarter century of experience has convinced me that Bellas Hess and Quill “can no longer be rationally justified.”  504 U. S., at 333.  The same is true for this Court’s entire negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence.  See Comptroller of Treasury of Md. v. Wynne, 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1).  Although I adhered to that jurisprudence in Quill, it is never too late to “surrende[r] former views to a better considered position.”  McGrath v. Kristensen,

340 U. S. 162, 178 (1950) (Jackson, J., concurring).  I therefore join the Court’s opinion.
