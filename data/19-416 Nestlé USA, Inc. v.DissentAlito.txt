															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 17, 2021]

															

															Justice Alito, dissenting.

															The primary question presented in the two certiorari petitions filed in these cases is whether domestic corporations are immune from liability under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS),

28 U. S. C. §1350.  I would decide that question, and for the reasons explained in Part I of Justice Gorsuch’s opinion, which I join, I would hold that if a particular claim may be brought under the ATS against a natural person who is a United States citizen, a similar claim may be brought against a domestic corporation.  See also ante, at 8, n. 4 (Sotomayor, J., joined by Breyer and Kagan, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Corporate status does not justify special immunity.

															The Court instead disposes of these cases by holding that respondents’ complaint seeks extraterritorial application of the ATS, but in my view, we should not decide that question at this juncture.  It is tied to the question whether the plaintiffs should be allowed to amend their complaint, and in order to reach the question of extraterritoriality, the Court must assume the answers to a host of important questions.  Specifically, the Court must assume: (1) that, contrary to the arguments set out in Part III of Justice Thomas’s opinion and Part II of Justice Gorsuch’s opinion, it is proper for us to recognize new claims that may be asserted under the ATS; (2) that the conduct petitioners are alleged to have aided and abetted provides the basis for such a claim; (3) that there is a “specific, universal, and obligatory” international law norm, Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain,

542 U.S. 692, 732 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), that imposes liability for what our legal system terms aiding and abetting; (4) that, if there is such a norm, we should choose to recognize an ATS aiding-and-abetting claim, see id., at 725–728, 732, 733, n. 21; and (5) that respondents’ complaint adequately alleges all the elements of such a claim, including the requisite mens rea.  Compare Doe I v. Nestle USA, Inc., 788 F.3d 946, 948–951 (CA9 2015) (Bea, J., dissenting from denial of reh’g en banc) (aider and abettor must act purposefully); Aziz v. Alcolac, Inc., 658 F.3d 388, 398–401 (CA4 2011) (same); Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., 582 F.3d 244, 257–259 (CA2 2009) (same), with Doe VIII v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 654 F.3d 11, 32–39 (CADC 2011) (aider and abettor need only act knowingly), vacated, 527 Fed. Appx. 7 (CADC 2013); Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Harm §28 (2018) (same); Restatement (Second) of Torts §876 (1977) (same).  A decision begins to take on the flavor of an advisory opinion when it is necessary to make so many important assumptions in order to reach the question that is actually resolved.

															To be sure, Part III of Justice Thomas’s opinion and Part II of Justice Gorsuch’s opinion make strong arguments that federal courts should never recognize new claims under the ATS.  But this issue was not raised by petitioners’ counsel, and I would not reach it here.

															For these reasons, I would reject petitioners’ argument on the question of corporate immunity, vacate the judgment below, and remand these cases for further proceedings in the District Court.
