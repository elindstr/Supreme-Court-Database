															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															ARTHUR GREGORY LANGE, PETITIONER v. CALIFORNIA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of california, first appellate district

															[June 23, 2021]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice kavanaugh joins as to Part II, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I join the majority opinion, except for Part II–A, which correctly rejects the argument that suspicion that a person committed any crime justifies warrantless entry into a home in hot pursuit of that person.  I write separately to note two things: the general case-by-case rule that the Court announces today is subject to historical, categorical exceptions; and under our precedent, the federal exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence discovered in the course of pursuing a fleeing suspect.

															I

															The majority sets out a general rule requiring a case-by-case inquiry when an officer enters a home without a warrant in pursuit of a person suspected of committing a misdemeanor.  But history suggests several categorical exceptions to this rule.  First, warrantless entry is categorically allowed when a person is arrested and escapes.  E.g., J. Parker, Conductor Generalis 28–29 (1788) (constables may break into houses without a warrant “[w]herever a person is lawfully arrested for any cause, and afterwards escapes, and shelters himself in an house”); ante, at 14, n. 5.  This exception is potentially very broad.  See Torres v. Madrid, 592 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 1) (holding that an arrest occurs whenever an officer applies physical force to the body with intent to restrain); Genner v. Sparks, 6 Mod. 173, 174, 87 Eng. Rep. 928, 929 (Q. B. 1704).  Second, authorities at common law categorically allowed warrantless entry when in hot pursuit of a person who committed an affray.  Ante, at 15.  Third, those authorities allowed the same for what the majority calls certain “pre-felonies.”  Ante, at 14. Finally, some authorities appear to have allowed warrantless entry when in pursuit of a person who had breached the peace.  See, e.g., 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 95 (1736) (Hale); Wilgus, Arrest Without a Warrant, 22 Mich. L. Rev. 798, 802–803 (1924)).  What crimes amounted to “breach of peace” for purposes of warrantless entry is not immediately clear.  The term sometimes was used to refer to violence, but the majority recognizes historical support for a broader definition.  Ante, at 15 (citing Hale 95).  And cases decided before and after the
 
Fourteenth Amendment was ratified similarly used the term “breach of peace” in a broad sense.  E.g., State v. Lafferty, 5 Del. 491 (1854) (“blow[ing] a trumpet at night through the streets”); Hawkins v. Lutton, 95 Wis. 492, 494, 70 N.W. 483 (1897) (“loud, profane, and indecent” language).

															I join the relevant parts of the majority on the understanding that its general case-by-case rule does not foreclose historical, categorical exceptions.  Although the majority unnecessarily leads with doctrine before history, it does not disturb our regular rule that history—not court-created standards of reasonableness—dictates the outcome whenever it provides an answer.  See, e.g., Wilson v. Arkansas,

514 U.S. 927, 931 (1995); Virginia v. Moore,

553 U.S. 164, 171 (2008).

															I also join on the understanding that the majority has not sought to settle the contours of any of these historical exceptions.

															II

															I also write to point out that even if the state courts on remand conclude that the officer’s entry here was unlawful, the federal exclusionary rule does not require suppressing any evidence.

															“[O]fficers who violated the
 
Fourth Amendment were traditionally considered trespassers.”  Utah v. Strieff,

579 U.S. 232, 237 (2016).  For that reason, “individuals subject to unconstitutional searches or seizures historically enforced their rights through tort suits or self-help.”  Ibid.  But beginning in the 20th century, this Court created a new remedy: exclusion of evidence in criminal trials.  Ibid.

															Establishing a violation of the
 
Fourth Amendment, though, does not automatically entitle a criminal defendant to exclusion of evidence.  Far from it.  “[T]he exclusionary rule is not an individual right.”  Herring v. United States,

555 U.S. 135, 141 (2009).  It is a “ ‘prudential’ doctrine created by this Court,” Davis v. United States,

564 U.S. 229, 236 (2011) (citation omitted), and there is always a “high obstacle for those urging application of the rule,” Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott,

524 U.S. 357, 364–365 (1998).  Relevant here, the rule “does not apply when the costs of exclusion outweigh its deterrent benefits.”  Strieff, 579 U. S., at 235.

															On the benefits side, “we have said time and again that the sole” factor courts can consider is “deter[ring] misconduct by law enforcement.”  Davis, 564 U. S., at 246.  And not just any misconduct.  The exclusionary rule developed to deter “intentional conduct that was patently unconstitutional.”  Herring, 555 U. S., at 143 (emphasis added).  For the past several decades, we have thus declined to exclude evidence where exclusion would not substantially deter “intentional” and “flagrant” behavior.  Id., at 144.  For example, the exclusionary rule does not apply where “some intervening circumstance” arises between unconstitutional conduct and discovery of evidence, Strieff, 579 U. S., at 238; where evidence would inevitably have been discovered, ibid.; or where officers have acted in good faith, United States v. Leon,

468 U.S. 897, 908 (1984).

															On the other side of the ledger, we consider all “costs.”  E.g., Davis, 564 U. S., at 237.  One cost is especially salient: excluding evidence under the
 
Fourth Amendment always obstructs the “ ‘truth-finding functions of judge and jury.’ ”  Leon, 468 U. S., at 907; accord, Nix v. Williams,

467 U.S. 431, 443 (1984) (recognizing “the public interest in having juries receive all probative evidence”).  This interference with the purpose of the judicial system also creates a downstream risk that “some guilty defendants may go free or receive reduced sentences.”  Leon, 468 U. S., at 907.

															By itself, this high cost makes exclusion under our precedent rarely appropriate.  “Suppression of evidence . . . has always been our last resort, not our first impulse.”  Hudson v. Michigan,

547 U.S. 586, 591 (2006).  When additional costs are present, the balance tips decisively against exclusion.

															Cases of fleeing suspects involve more than enough added costs to render the exclusionary rule inapplicable.  First, our precedents make clear that the exclusionary rule does not apply when it would encourage bad conduct by criminal defendants.  For example, evidence obtained during an unlawful search is still admissible to impeach a witness because exclusion would create “ ‘a license to use perjury.’ ”  United States v. Havens,

446 U.S. 620, 626 (1980).  Here, exclusion is inappropriate because it would encourage suspects to flee.  Second, our precedents similarly make clear that criminal defendants cannot use the exclusionary rule as “a shield against” their own bad conduct.  Walder v. United States,

347 U.S. 62, 65 (1954).  In most—if not all—States, fleeing from police after a lawful order to stop is a crime.  All the evidence that petitioner seeks to exclude is evidence that inevitably would have been discovered had he complied with the officer’s order to stop.  A criminal defendant should “not . . . be put in a better position than [he] would have been in if no illegality had transpired.”  Nix, 467 U. S., at 443–444.

															Aware of the substantial costs created by the exclusionary rule, courts have sometimes narrowed the protections historically afforded by the
 
Fourth Amendment to avoid having to exclude evidence.  See Collins v. Virginia, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1); A. Amar, The Constitution and Criminal Procedure: First Principles 30 (1997) (“Judges do not like excluding bloody knives, so they distort doctrine”).  But it should be the judicially created remedy, not the
 
Fourth Amendment, that contracts in the face of that pressure.  Courts should follow the plain dictates of our precedent: Officers cannot chase a fleeing person into a home simply because that person is suspected of having committed any misdemeanor, but if the officer nonetheless does so, exclusion under the
 
Fourth Amendment is improper.  Criminal defendants must rely on other remedies.
