															WISCONSIN LEGISLATURE, et al. v. WISCONSIN ELECTIONS COMMISSION, et al.

															on application for stay and injunctive relief

															[March 23, 2022]

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kagan joins, dissenting.

															The Court’s action today is unprecedented.  In an emergency posture, the Court summarily overturns a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision resolving a conflict over the State’s redistricting, a decision rendered after a 5-month process involving all interested stakeholders.  Despite the fact that summary reversals are generally reserved for decisions in violation of settled law, the Court today faults the State Supreme Court for its failure to comply with an obligation that, under existing precedent, is hazy at best.

															When the Wisconsin Legislature and executive were unable to agree on reapportioned electoral maps following the 2020 census, the Wisconsin Supreme Court granted a voter petition to ensure that maps were in place before the 2022 elections.  The court announced the criteria that it would use to select maps (namely, that it would seek to minimize changes from the 2011 maps while accounting for population shifts) and permitted any party to intervene and submit maps for consideration.  See Johnson v. Wisconsin Elections Comm’n, 2021 WI 87, ¶81, 399 Wis. 2d 623, 671, 967 N.W.2d 469, 493.[1]  The court ultimately rejected the State Assembly map submitted by the Wisconsin Legislature (applicants here) in favor of the map submitted by the Governor because it found the Governor’s map “vastly superior” under its announced “least change” criteria.  Johnson v. Wisconsin Elections Comm’n, 2022 WI 14, ¶¶26, 29, ___ Wis. 2d ___, ___, ___ N. W. 2d ___, ___, ___.

															The court proceeded to a preliminary analysis of whether the Equal Protection Clause or the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) precluded it from adopting the Governor’s map, which increased the number of majority-Black Assembly districts in Milwaukee from six to seven based on changes in population.[2]  The court noted that the parties before it had all “appeared to assume the VRA requires at least some majority-Black districts in the Milwaukee area” and that there had been no dispute that the preconditions in Thornburg v. Gingles, 
478 U.S. 30 (1986) (for assessing whether race-conscious districting is required in order to avoid diluting minority voting power) were satisfied, aside from an undeveloped reference at oral argument.  2022 WI 14, ¶45.  The court stressed, however, that no Equal Protection Clause or VRA claim was before it and that adjudicating such claims would require a fuller record and a closer assessment.  It concluded that neither the Equal Protection Clause nor the VRA clearly foreclosed adopting the Governor’s map in the first instance, id., ¶47, but left open the possibility that a “standard VRA claim” could be “brought after the adoption of new districts,” id., ¶41, n. 24.

															Applicants now assert that the Wisconsin Supreme Court misapplied this Court’s precedents in its preliminary assessment of whether the Governor’s map violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The Court agrees and summarily reverses.  In doing so, however, the Court assumes the answers to multiple questions that our precedent leaves uncertain.

															In its brief discussion of equal protection and the VRA,  

															 

															the Wisconsin Supreme Court presumed that the framework summarized in this Court’s decision in Cooper v. Harris, 581 U. S. ___ (2017), governed in this posture.  The Court tacitly accepts that assumption.  Ante, at 4.  Cooper, however, arose in a starkly different posture.  Cooper outlines the specific, burden-shifting procedure for adjudicating claims brought under the Equal Protection Clause “[w]hen a voter sues state officials for drawing . . . race-based lines.”  581 U. S., at ___ (slip. op., at 2).  That framework requires that the plaintiff first “prove that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature’s decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.”  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  If the court finds that “racial considerations predominated over others,” the burden then “shifts to the State to prove that its race-based sorting of voters” satisfies strict scrutiny.  Ibid.  The State can meet that burden by showing that “it had a strong basis in evidence” for concluding that the VRA required its actions, a standard that “gives States breathing room to adopt reasonable compliance measures that may prove, in perfect hindsight, not to have been needed.”  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted).[3]  It is far from clear whether this burden-shifting framework should also apply in the unusual circumstance where, as here, a state court is adopting a map in the first instance with no Equal Protection Clause claim before it.

															Even accepting the assumption that this framework controls, it remains unclear how a court in the posture below should apply it.  Again, the Wisconsin Supreme Court was selecting a map itself, not adjudicating a subsequent challenge in the manner that Cooper and other cases have addressed.  The court accepted an original action to supervise the redistricting and, with the input of the parties, designed its own process for doing so: accepting proposed maps from litigants rather than “craft[ing its] own map” and determining to “choose the maps that best conform[ed] with [its] directives,” even if those maps were “imperfect,” rather than “modify[ing]” the lines they drew.  2022 WI 14, ¶¶4, 6.  Although the Governor reported that he considered race in drawing his Assembly map, the Wisconsin Supreme Court selected the Governor’s map because it scored best on a race-neutral “least change” metric.  Id., ¶8.  Our precedents offer no clear answers to the question whose motives should be analyzed in these circumstances (the four justices who selected the map based on the “least change” criteria, the Governor, or some combination) or how.  The Court does not purport to answer this question.

															The Court also faults the Wisconsin Supreme Court for failing to scrutinize each of the Gingles preconditions independently after the parties agreed that some majority-Black districts needed to be drawn in Milwaukee.  Ante, at 6–7.[4]  But courts generally are not mandated to investigate “ ‘undisputed’ ” and nonjurisdictional issues.  Ante, at 6.  The Court points to no precedent requiring a court conducting a malapportionment analysis to embark on an independent inquiry into matters that the parties have conceded or not contested, like the Gingles preconditions here.

															This Court’s intervention today is not only extraordinary but also unnecessary.  The Wisconsin Supreme Court rightly preserved the possibility that an appropriate plaintiff could bring an equal protection or VRA challenge in the proper forum.  2022 WI 14, ¶41, n. 24.  I would allow that process to unfold, rather than further complicating these proceedings with legal confusion through a summary reversal.  I respectfully dissent.
Notes
1
 Before this Court, applicants do not challenge this process. 

2
 The court found that the Black voting age population in the Milwaukee area had increased 5.5% since the last census, while the White voting age population had decreased 9.5%.  2022 WI 14, ¶48. 

3
 The other precedents on which the Court relies arose in analogous postures.  See Abbott v. Perez, 585 U. S. ___ (2018); League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry,

548 U.S. 399 (2006); Shaw v. Hunt,

517 U.S. 899 (1996); Johnson v. De Grandy,

512 U.S. 997 (1994); Thornburg v. Gingles,

478 U.S. 30 (1986). 

4
 Applicants proposed a map with five majority-Black districts and a sixth with less than a majority.  The court below noted concern that applicants’ map might violate the VRA by “packing” minority voters into a “small number of districts to minimize their influence in the districts next door.”  2022 WI 14, ¶49 (internal quotation marks omitted).
