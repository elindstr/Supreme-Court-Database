															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 17–1705

															PDR NETWORK, LLC, et al., PETITIONERS v. CARLTON & HARRIS CHIROPRACTIC, INC.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 20, 2019]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring in the judgment.

															For the reasons explained by Justice Kavanaugh, the Court of Appeals misinterpreted the Hobbs Act.  I write separately to address a more fundamental problem with that court’s holding: It rests on a mistaken—and possibly unconstitutional—understanding of the relationship between federal statutes and the agency orders interpreting them.

															The opinion below assumes that an executive agency’s interpretation of a statute it administers serves as an authoritative gloss on the statutory text unless timely challenged.  But for that assumption, the Hobbs Act would have no role to play in this case.  This suit is a dispute between private parties, and petitioners did not ask the District Court to “enjoin, set aside, suspend,” or “determine the validity of” any order of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

28 U. S. C. §2342(1).  Indeed, they did not even initiate this suit.  They simply argued that the fax at issue here was not an “unsolicited advertisement” and thus did not violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), as respondent contended.  See 47 U. S. C. §§227(a)(5), (b)(1)(C).  The District Court agreed, but the Fourth Circuit reversed, explaining that the FCC had adopted an order interpreting the term “unsolicited advertisement” and that, under the Hobbs Act, only the Courts of Appeals had jurisdiction to “determine the validity of” such orders.  §2342; see 883 F.3d 459, 464 (2018).  According to the decision below, the Hobbs Act “precluded the district court from even reaching” the question of the TCPA’s meaning because “a district court simply cannot reach [that] question without ‘rubbing up against the Hobbs Act’s jurisdictional bar.’ ”  Ibid. (emphasis added).

															As Justice Kavanaugh explains, the Fourth Circuit was incorrect.  Interpreting a statute does not “determine the validity” of an agency order interpreting or implementing the statute.  See post, at 11–13 (opinion concurring in judgment).[1]

															A contrary view would arguably render the Hobbs Act unconstitutional.  If the Act truly “precluded the district court from even reaching” the text of the TCPA and instead required courts to treat “FCC interpretations of the TCPA” as authoritative, 883 F. 3d, at 464, then the Act would trench upon Article III’s vesting of the “judicial Power” in the courts.  As I have explained elsewhere, “the judicial power, as originally understood, requires a court to exercise its independent judgment in interpreting and expounding upon the laws.”  Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn.,

575 U.S. 92, ___ (2015) (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 8).  That duty necessarily entails identifying and applying the governing law.  Insofar as the Hobbs Act purports to prevent courts from applying the governing statute to a case or controversy within its jurisdiction, the Act conflicts with the “province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.”  Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).  And to the extent the Hobbs Act requires courts to “give the ‘force of law’ to agency pronouncements on matters of private conduct” without regard to the text of the governing statute, the Act would be unconstitutional for the additional reason that it would “permit a body other than Congress” to exercise the legislative power, in violation of Article I.  Michigan v. EPA, 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3).  At a minimum, our constitutional-avoidance precedents would militate against the Fourth Circuit’s view of the Hobbs Act.

															The decision below rested on the assumption that Congress can constitutionally require federal courts to treat agency orders as controlling law, without regard to the text of the governing statute.  A similar assumption underlies our precedents requiring judicial deference to certain agency interpretations.  See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U.S. 837 (1984).  This case proves the error of that assumption and emphasizes the need to reconsider it.
Notes
1
Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, ante, at 5, it therefore makes no difference whether the FCC order at issue here is a legislative rule or an interpretive rule.  In any event, the order is clearly interpretive—it was “ ‘issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency’s construction of ’ ” the term “unsolicited advertisement.”  Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn.,

575 U.S. 92, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 3).
