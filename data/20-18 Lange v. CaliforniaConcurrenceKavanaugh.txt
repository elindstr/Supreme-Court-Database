															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															ARTHUR GREGORY LANGE, PETITIONER v. CALIFORNIA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of california, first appellate district

															[June 23, 2021]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															The Court holds that an officer may make a warrantless entry into a home when pursuing a fleeing misdemeanant if an exigent circumstance is also present—for example, when there is a risk of escape, destruction of evidence, or harm to others.  I join the Court’s opinion.  I also join Part II of Justice Thomas’s concurrence regarding how the exclusionary rule should apply to hot pursuit cases.

															I add this brief concurrence simply to underscore that, in my view, there is almost no daylight in practice between the Court’s opinion and The Chief Justice’s opinion concurring in the judgment.

															In his thoughtful opinion, The Chief Justice concludes that pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanant should itself constitute an exigent circumstance.  The Court disagrees.  As I see it, however, the difference between The Chief Justice’s approach and the Court’s approach will be academic in most cases.  That is because cases of fleeing misdemeanants will almost always also involve a recognized exigent circumstance—such as a risk of escape, destruction of evidence, or harm to others—that will still justify warrantless entry into a home.  See ante, at 1, 4, 16; see also, e.g., City and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan,

575 U.S. 600, 612 (2015); Kentucky v. King,

563 U.S. 452, 460 (2011); Brigham City v. Stuart,

547 U.S. 398, 403 (2006); Minnesota v. Olson,

495 U.S. 91, 100 (1990).  As Lange’s able counsel forthrightly acknowledged at oral argument, the approach adopted by the Court today will still allow the police to make a warrantless entry into a home “nine times out of 10 or more” in cases involving pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanant.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 34.

															Importantly, moreover, the Court’s opinion does not disturb the long-settled rule that pursuit of a fleeing felon is itself an exigent circumstance justifying warrantless entry into a home.  See United States v. Santana,

427 U.S. 38, 42–43 (1976); cf. Stanton v. Sims,

571 U.S. 3, 8, 9 (2013) (per curiam).  In other words, the police may make a warrantless entry into the home of a fleeing felon regardless of whether other exigent circumstances are present.

															With those observations, I join the Court’s opinion.
