															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															MISSOURI, PETITIONER v. TYLER G.
McNEELY

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
missouri

															[April 17, 2013]

															

															Justice Kennedy, concurring in part.

															I join Parts I, II–A, II–B, and IV
of the opinion for the Court.

															For the reasons stated below this case does not
call for the Court to consider in detail the issue discussed in
Part II–C and the separate opinion by The Chief Justice.

															As to Part III, much that is noted with respect
to the statistical and survey data will be of relevance when this
issue is explored in later cases. The repeated insistence in Part
III that every case be determined by its own circumstances is
correct, of course, as a general proposition; yet it ought not to
be interpreted to indicate this question is not susceptible of
rules and guidelines that can give important, practical instruction
to arresting officers, in- struction that in any number of
instances would allow a warrantless blood test in order to preserve
the critical evidence.

															States and other governmental entities which
enforce the driving laws can adopt rules, procedures, and protocols
that meet the reasonableness requirements of the Fourth Amendment
and give helpful guidance to law enforcement officials. And this
Court, in due course, may find it appropriate and necessary to
consider a case permitting it to provide more guidance than it
undertakes to give today.

															As the opinion of the Court is correct to note,
the instant case, by reason of the way in which it was presented
and decided in the state courts, does not provide a framework where
it is prudent to hold any more than that always dispensing with a
warrant for a blood test when a driver is arrested for being under
the influence of alcohol is inconsistent with the Fourth
Amendment.
