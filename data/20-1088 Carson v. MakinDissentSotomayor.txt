															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit

															[June 21, 2022]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, dissenting.

															This Court continues to dismantle the wall of separation between church and state that the Framers fought to build.  Justice Breyer explains why the Court’s analysis falters on its own terms, and I join all but Part I–B of his dissent.  I write separately to add three points.

															First, this Court should not have started down this path five years ago.  See Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U. S. ___ (2017).  Before Trinity Lutheran, it was well established that “both the United States and state constitutions embody distinct views” on “the subject of religion”—“in favor of free exercise, but opposed to establishment”—“that find no counterpart” with respect to other constitutional rights.  Locke v. Davey,

540 U.S. 712, 721 (2004).  Because of this tension, the Court recognized “ ‘room for play in the joints’ between” the Religion Clauses, with “some state actions permitted by the Establishment Clause but not required by the Free Exercise Clause.”  Id., at 718–719 (quoting Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York,

397 U.S. 664, 669 (1970)); see ante, at 4 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Using this flexibility, and consistent with a rich historical tradition, see Trinity Lutheran, 582 U. S., at ___–___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11–16), States and the Federal Government could decline to fund religious institutions.  Moreover, the Court for many decades understood the Establishment Clause to prohibit government from funding religious exercise.[1]

															Over time, the Court eroded these principles in certain respects.  See, e.g., Zelman v. Simmons-Harris,

536 U.S. 639, 662 (2002) (allowing government funds to flow to religious schools if private individuals selected the benefiting schools; the government program was “entirely neutral with respect to religion”; and families enjoyed a “genuine choice among options public and private, secular and religious”).  Nevertheless, the space between the Clauses continued to afford governments “some room to recognize the unique status of religious entities and to single them out on that basis for exclusion from otherwise generally applicable laws.”  Trinity Lutheran, 582 U. S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 9).

															Trinity Lutheran veered sharply away from that understanding.  After assuming away an Establishment Clause violation, the Court revolutionized Free Exercise doctrine by equating a State’s decision not to fund a religious organization with presumptively unconstitutional discrimination on the basis of religious status.  See id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11).  A plurality, however, limited the Court’s decision to “express discrimination based on religious identity” (i.e., status), not “religious uses of funding.”  Id., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n. 3).  In other words, a State was barred from withholding funding from a religious entity “solely because of its religious character,” id., at ___ (opinion of the Court) (slip op., at 14), but retained authority to do so on the basis that the funding would be put to religious uses.  Two Terms ago, the Court reprised and extended Trinity Lutheran’s error to hold that a State could not limit a private-school voucher program to secular schools.  Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 9).  The Court, however, again refrained from extending Trinity Lutheran from funding restrictions based on religious status to those based on religious uses.  Espinoza, 591 U. S., at ___–___ (2020) (slip op., at 9–12).

															As Justice Breyer explains, see ante, at 8–9, this status-use distinction readily distinguishes this case from Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza.  I warned in Trinity Lutheran, however, that the Court’s analysis could “be manipulated to call for a similar fate for lines drawn on the basis of religious use.”  582 U. S., at ___, n. 14 (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 25, n. 14).  That fear has come to fruition: The Court now holds for the first time that “any status-use distinction” is immaterial in both “theory” and “practice.”  Ante, at 17.  It reaches that conclusion by embracing arguments from prior separate writings and ignoring decades of precedent affording governments flexibility in navigating the tension between the Religion Clauses.  As a result, in just a few years, the Court has upended constitutional doctrine, shifting from a rule that permits States to decline to fund religious organizations to one that requires States in many circumstances to subsidize religious indoctrination with taxpayer dollars.

															Second, the consequences of the Court’s rapid transformation of the Religion Clauses must not be understated.  From a doctrinal perspective, the Court’s failure to apply the play-in-the-joints principle here, see ante, at 13–14 (Breyer, J., dissenting), leaves one to wonder what, if anything, is left of it.  The Court’s increasingly expansive view of the Free Exercise Clause risks swallowing the space between the Religion Clauses that once “permit[ted] religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interference.”  Walz, 397 U. S., at 669.

															From a practical perspective, today’s decision directs the State of Maine (and, by extension, its taxpaying citizens) to subsidize institutions that undisputedly engage in religious instruction.  See ante, at 10–11 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  In addition, while purporting to protect against discrimination of one kind, the Court requires Maine to fund what many of its citizens believe to be discrimination of other kinds.  See ante, at 16 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (summarizing Bangor Christian Schools’ and Temple Academy’s policies denying enrollment to students based on gender identity, sexual orientation, and religion).  The upshot is that Maine must choose between giving subsidies to its residents or refraining from financing religious teaching and practices.

															Finally, the Court’s decision is especially perverse because the benefit at issue is the public education to which all of Maine’s children are entitled under the State Constitution.  As this Court has long recognized, the Establishment Clause requires that public education be secular and neutral as to religion.  See ante, at 2–3, 12 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  The Court avoids this framing of Maine’s benefit because, it says, “Maine has decided not to operate schools of its own, but instead to offer tuition assistance that parents may direct to the public or private schools of their choice.”  Ante, at 14.  In fact, any such “deci[sion],” ibid., was forced upon Maine by “the realities of remote geography and low population density,” ante, at 2, which render it impracticable for the State to operate its own schools in many communities.

															The Court’s analysis does leave some options open to Maine.  For example, under state law, school administrative units (SAUs) that cannot feasibly operate their own schools may contract directly with a public school in another SAU, or with an approved private school, to educate their students.  See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 20–A, §§2701, 2702 (2008).  I do not understand today’s decision to mandate that SAUs contract directly with schools that teach religion, which would go beyond Zelman’s private-choice doctrine and blatantly violate the Establishment Clause.  Nonetheless, it is irrational for this Court to hold that the Free Exercise Clause bars Maine from giving money to parents to fund the only type of education the State may provide consistent with the Establishment Clause: a religiously neutral one.  Nothing in the Constitution requires today’s result.

															*  *  *

															What a difference five years makes.  In 2017, I feared that the Court was “lead[ing] us . . . to a place where separation of church and state is a constitutional slogan, not a constitutional commitment.”  Trinity Lutheran, 582 U. S., at ___ (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 27).  Today, the Court leads us to a place where separation of church and state becomes a constitutional violation.  If a State cannot offer subsidies to its citizens without being required to fund religious exercise, any State that values its historic antiestablishment interests more than this Court does will have to curtail the support it offers to its citizens.  With growing concern for where this Court will lead us next, I respectfully dissent.
