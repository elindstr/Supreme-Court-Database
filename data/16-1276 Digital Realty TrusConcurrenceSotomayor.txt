															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 16–1276

															DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC., PETITIONER v. PAUL SOMERS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[February 21, 2018]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Breyer joins, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full.  I write separately only to note my disagreement with the suggestion in my colleague’s concurrence that a Senate Report is not an appropriate source for this Court to consider when interpreting a statute.

															Legislative history is of course not the law, but that does not mean it cannot aid us in our understanding of a law.  Just as courts are capable of assessing the reliability and utility of evidence generally, they are capable of assessing the reliability and utility of legislative-history materials.

															Committee reports, like the Senate Report the Court discusses here, see ante, at 3–4, 11–12, 16–18, are a particularly reliable source to which we can look to ensure our fidelity to Congress’ intended meaning.  See Garcia v. United States,

469 U. S. 70,
76 (1984)
 (“In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature’s intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which ‘represen[t] the considered and collective understanding of those Congressmen involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation’ ” (quoting Zuber v. Allen,

396 U. S. 168,
186 (1969)
)).  Bills presented to Congress for consideration are generally accompanied by a committee report.  Such reports are typically circulated at least two days before a bill is to be considered on the floor and provide Members of Congress and their staffs with information about “a bill’s context, purposes, policy implications, and details,” along with information on its supporters and opponents.  R. Katzmann, Judging Statutes 20, and n. 62 (2014) (citing A. LaRue, Senate Manual Containing the Standing Rules, Orders, Laws, and Resolutions Affecting the Business of the United States Senate, S. Doc. No. 107–1, p. 17 (2001)).  These materials “have long been important means of informing the whole chamber about proposed legislation,” Katzmann, Judging Statutes, at 19, a point Members themselves have emphasized over the years.[1]*  It is thus no surprise that legislative staffers view committee and conference reports as the most reliable type of legislative history.  See Gluck & Bressman, Statutory Interpretation From the Inside—An Empirical Study of Congressional Drafting, Delegation and the Canons: Part I, 65 Stan. L. Rev. 901, 977 (2013).

															Legislative history can be particularly helpful when a statute is ambiguous or deals with especially complex matters.  But even when, as here, a statute’s meaning can clearly be discerned from its text, consulting reliable legislative history can still be useful, as it enables us to corroborate and fortify our understanding of the text.  See, e.g., Tapia v. United States,

564 U. S. 319
–332 (2011); Carr v. United States,

560 U. S. 438
–458 (2010).  Moreover, confirming our construction of a statute by considering reliable legislative history shows respect for and promotes comity with a coequal branch of Government.  See Katzmann, Judging Statutes, at 35–36.

															For these reasons, I do not think it wise for judges to close their eyes to reliable legislative history—and the realities of how Members of Congress create and enact laws—when it is available.

Charles E. Grassley) (“[A]s one who has served in Congress for 12 years, legislative history is very important to those of us here who want further detailed expression of that legislative intent”); Mikva, Reading and Writing Statutes, 28 S. Tex. L. Rev. 181, 184 (1986) (“The committee report is the bone structure of the legislation.  It is the road map that explains why things are in and things are out of the statute”); Brudney, Congressional Commentary on Judicial Interpretations of Statutes: Idle Chatter or Telling Response? 93 Mich. L. Rev. 1, 28 (1994) (compiling the views of former Members on “the central importance of committee reports to their own understanding of statutory text”).  In fact, some Members “are more likely to vote . . . based on a reading of the legislative history than on a reading of the statute itself.”  Gluck & Bressman, Statutory Interpretation From the Inside—An Empirical Study of Congressional Drafting, Delegation and the Canons: Part I, 65 Stan.
