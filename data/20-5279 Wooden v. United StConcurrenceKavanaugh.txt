															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															WILLIAM DALE WOODEN, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[March 7, 2022]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full.  In light of Justice Gorsuch’s thoughtful concurrence in the judgment, I write separately to briefly explain why the rule of lenity has appropriately played only a very limited role in this Court’s criminal case law.  And I further explain how another principle—the presumption of mens rea—can address Justice Gorsuch’s important concern, which I share, about fair notice in federal criminal law.

															A common formulation of the rule of lenity is as follows: If a federal criminal statute is grievously ambiguous, then the statute should be interpreted in the criminal defendant’s favor.  See Ocasio v. United States,

578 U.S. 282, 295, n. 8 (2016).  Importantly, the rule of lenity does not apply when a law merely contains some ambiguity or is difficult to decipher.  As this Court has often said, the rule of lenity applies only when “ ‘after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,’ ” the statute is still grievously ambiguous.  Ibid. (quoting Muscarello v. United States,

524 U.S. 125, 138–139 (1998)); see Shular v. United States, 589 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1, 3).  The rule “comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.”  Callanan v. United States,

364 U.S. 587, 596 (1961).  Our repeated use of the term “grievous ambiguity” underscores that point.  See, e.g., Shaw v. United States,

580 U.S. 63, 71 (2016); Salman v. United States,

580 U.S. 39, 51 (2016); Abramski v. United States,

573 U.S. 169, 188, n. 10 (2014).

															Properly applied, the rule of lenity therefore rarely if ever plays a role because, as in other contexts, “hard interpretive conundrums, even relating to complex rules, can often be solved.”  Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 14); see also Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U.S. 837, 843, n. 9 (1984).  And if “a reviewing court employs all of the traditional tools of construction, the court will almost always reach a conclusion about the best interpretation of the [law] at issue.”  Kisor, 588 U. S., at ___ (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).

															In short, because a court must exhaust all the tools of statutory interpretation before resorting to the rule of lenity, and because a court that does so often determines the best reading of the statute, the rule of lenity rarely if ever comes into play.  In other words, “if lenity invariably comes in ‘last,’ it should essentially come in never.”  D. Kahan, Lenity and Federal Common Law Crimes, 1994 S. Ct. Rev. 345, 386.  As I see it, that explains why this Court rarely relies on the rule of lenity, at least as a decisive factor. 

															I would not upset our rule of lenity case law by making the ambiguity trigger any easier to satisfy.  For example, I would not say that any front-end ambiguity in the statute justifies resort to the rule of lenity even before exhausting the tools of statutory interpretation.  One major problem with that kind of ambiguity trigger is that ambiguity is in the eye of the beholder and cannot be readily determined on an objective basis.  Applying a looser front-end ambiguity trigger would just exacerbate that problem, leading to significant inconsistency, unpredictability, and unfairness in application.  See B. Kavanaugh, Fixing Statutory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 2118, 2136–2139 (2016).

															For those reasons, I would not alter our rule of lenity case law.  That said, I very much agree with Justice Gorsuch about the importance of fair notice in federal criminal law.  But as I see it, that concern for fair notice is better addressed by other doctrines that protect criminal defendants against arbitrary or vague federal criminal statutes—in particular, the presumption of mens rea.

															The deeply rooted presumption of mens rea generally requires the Government to prove the defendant’s mens rea with respect to each element of a federal offense, unless Congress plainly provides otherwise.  See Rehaif v. United States, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op, at 3); see also Flores-Figueroa v. United States,

556 U.S. 646, 652 (2009); W. Eskridge, Interpreting Law: A Primer on How To Read Statutes and the Constitution 350–351 (2016); A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 303–312 (2012).  In addition, with respect to federal crimes requiring “willfulness,” the Court generally requires the Government to prove that the defendant was aware that his conduct was unlawful.  See Bryan v. United States,

524 U.S. 184, 191–193 (1998); Cheek v. United States,

498 U.S. 192, 201–203 (1991).

															To be sure, if a federal criminal statute does not contain a “willfulness” requirement and if a defendant is prosecuted for violating a legal prohibition or requirement that the defendant honestly was unaware of and reasonably may not have anticipated, unfairness can result because of a lack of fair notice.  That scenario could arise with some malum prohibitum federal crimes, for example.  But when that fair notice problem arises, one solution where appropriate could be to require proof that the defendant was aware that his conduct was unlawful.  Alternatively, another solution could be to allow a mistake-of-law defense in certain circumstances—consistent with the longstanding legal principle that an act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty.  See Morissette v. United States,

342 U.S. 246, 250–252 (1952).

															In sum, I would not invite the inconsistency, unpredictability, and unfairness that would result from expanding the rule of lenity beyond its very limited place in the Court’s case law.  I would, however, continue to vigorously apply (and where appropriate, extend) mens rea requirements, which as Justice Robert Jackson remarked, are “as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil.”  Id., at 250.
