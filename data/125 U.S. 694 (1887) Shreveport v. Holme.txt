125 U.S. 694

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA
Syllabus 

															A petition for a rehearing of a case decided by a divided Court is denied on the ground that no important constitutional question is involved.

															These cases, which were all submitted together, were all affirmed by a divided Court on the 14th day of November, 1887.  The plaintiff in error petitioned for a rehearing, citing Home Ins. Co. v. New York, 119 U. S. 129.

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.

															These petitions are denied.  The rehearing was granted in Home Insurance Co. v. New York, 119 U. S. 129, after a decision by a divided Court, because an important constitutional question was involved.  The questions in these cases are not of that character.
