U.S. Supreme CourtHampton v. McConnel, 16 U.S. 3 Wheat. 234 234 (1818)
Hampton v. McConnel
16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 234

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF
THE DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA
Syllabus 

															A judgment of a state court has the same credit, validity, and effect, in every other court within the United States which it had in the state where it was rendered, and whatever pleas would be good to a suit thereon in such state, and none others, can be pleaded in any other court within the United States.

															The defendant in error declared against the plaintiff in error in debt on a judgment of the supreme court of the State of New York, to which the defendant below plead nil debet and the plaintiff below demurred.  The circuit court rendered a judgment for the plaintiff below, and thereupon the cause was brought by writ of error to this Court.

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.

															This is precisely the same case as that of Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch 481.  The Court cannot distinguish the two cases.  The doctrine there held was that the judgment of a state court should have the same credit, validity, and effect in every other court of the United States which it had in the state where it was pronounced, and that whatever pleas would be good to a suit thereon in such state, and none others, could be pleaded in any other court in the United States.

															Judgment affirmed.
