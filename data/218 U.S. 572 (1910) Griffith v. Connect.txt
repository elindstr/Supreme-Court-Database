U.S. Supreme CourtGriffith v. Connecticut, 218 U.S. 572 (1910)
Griffith v. Connecticut
No. 515
Motion to dismiss or affirm
Submitted November 28, 1910
Decided December 12, 1910
218 U.S. 572

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ERRORS
OF THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT
Syllabus 

															Decided on authority of Griffith v. Connecticut, ante, p.  218 U. S. 563.

															The facts are stated in the opinion.

															MR. JUSTICE White delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The parties to this record are the same as in No. 514, just decided, ante, p.  218 U. S. 563, and the questions involved are the same, the prosecution being for similar offenses against the Connecticut Act of 1907.  Both cases were tried together.  Upon the conviction in this, however, the trial court imposed the penalty of imprisonment.  The two cases were disposed of by the Supreme Court of Errors in one opinion.  As the decision in No. 514 is necessarily controlling, it follows that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut must be, and it is,

															Affirmed.
