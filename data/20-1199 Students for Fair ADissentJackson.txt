															UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,
et al.

															on writ of certiorari before judgment to the
united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 29, 2023]

															

															Justice Jackson, with whom Justice Sotomayor
and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.[1]*

															Gulf-sized race-based gaps exist with respect to
the health, wealth, and well-being of American citizens. They were
created in the distant past, but have indisputably been passed down
to the present day through the generations. Every moment these gaps
persist is a moment in which this great country falls short of
actualizing one of its foundational principles—the
“self-evident” truth that all of us are created equal.
Yet, today, the Court determines that holistic admissions programs
like the one that the University of North Carolina (UNC) has
operated, consistent with Grutter v. Bollinger,
539 U.S.
306 (2003), are a problem with respect to achievement of that
aspiration, rather than a viable solution (as has long been evident
to historians, sociologists, and policymakers alike).

															Justice Sotomayor has persuasively established
that nothing in the Constitution or Title VI prohibits institutions
from taking race into account to ensure the racial diversity of
admits in higher education. I join her opinion without
qualification. I write separately to expound upon the universal
benefits of considering race in this context, in response to a
suggestion that has permeated this legal action from the start.
Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) has maintained, both subtly and
overtly, that it is unfair for a college’s admissions
process to consider race as one factor in a holistic review of its
applicants. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.

															This contention blinks both history and reality
in ways too numerous to count. But the response is simple: Our
country has never been colorblind. Given the lengthy history of
state-sponsored race-based preferences in America, to say that
anyone is now victimized if a college considers whether that legacy
of discrimination has unequally ad- vantaged its applicants fails
to acknowledge the well- documented “intergenerational
transmission of inequality” that still plagues our
citizenry.[2]

															It is that inequality that admissions
programs such as UNC’s help to address, to the benefit of us
all. Because the majority’s judgment stunts that progress
without any basis in law, history, logic, or justice, I
dissent.

															A

															Imagine two college applicants from North
Carolina, John and James. Both trace their family’s North
Carolina roots to the year of UNC’s founding in 1789. Both
love their State and want great things for its people. Both want to
honor their family’s legacy by attending the State’s
flagship educational institution. John, however, would be the
seventh generation to graduate from UNC. He is White. James would
be the first; he is Black. Does the race of these applicants
properly play a role in UNC’s holistic merits-based
admissions process?

															To answer that question, “a page of
history is worth a volume of logic.” New York Trust
Co. v. Eisner, 256 U.S.
345, 349 (1921). Many chapters of America’s history
appear necessary, given the opinions that my colleagues in the
majority have issued in this case.

															Justice Thurgood Marshall recounted the
genesis:

															“Three hundred and fifty years ago,
the Negro was dragged to this country in chains to be sold into
slavery. Uprooted from his homeland and thrust into bondage for
forced labor, the slave was deprived of all legal rights. It was
unlawful to teach him to read; he could be sold away from his
family and friends at the whim of his master; and killing or
maiming him was not a crime. The system of slavery brutalized and
dehumanized both master and slave.” Regents of Univ. of
Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S.
265, 387–388 (1978).

															Slavery should have been (and was to many) self-
evidently dissonant with our avowed founding principles. When the
time came to resolve that dissonance, eleven States chose slavery.
With the Union’s survival at stake, Frederick Douglass noted,
Black Americans in the South “were almost the only reliable
friends the nation had,” and “but for their help
. . . the Rebels might have succeeded in breaking up the
Union.”[3] After the war,
Senator John Sherman defended the proposed Fourteenth Amendment in
a manner that encapsulated our Reconstruction Framers’
highest sentiments: “We are bound by every obligation, by
[Black Americans’] service on the battlefield, by their
heroes who are buried in our cause, by their patriotism in the
hours that tried our country, we are bound to protect them and all
their natural rights.”[4]

															To uphold that promise, the Framers repudiated
this Court’s holding in Dred Scott v. Sandford,
19 How. 393 (1857), by crafting Reconstruction Amendments (and
associated legislation) that transformed our Constitution and
society.[5] Even after this
Second Founding—when the need to right historical wrongs
should have been clear beyond cavil—opponents insisted that
vindicating equality in this manner slighted White Americans. So,
when the Reconstruction Congress passed a bill to secure all
citizens “the same [civil] right[s]” as “enjoyed
by white citizens,” 14Stat. 27, President Andrew Johnson
vetoed it because it “discriminat[ed] . . . in
favor of the negro.”[6]

															That attitude, and the Nation’s associated
retreat from Reconstruction, made prophesy out of Congressman
Thaddeus Stevens’s fear that “those States will all
. . . keep up this discrimination, and crush to death the
hated freedmen.”[7] And
this Court facilitated that retrenchment.[8] Not just in Plessy v. Ferguson,
163 U.S.
537 (1896), but “in almost every instance, the Court
chose to restrict the scope of the second founding.”[9] Thus, thirteen years
pre-Plessy, in the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3
(1883), our predecessors on this Court invalidated Congress’s
attempt to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments via the Civil
Rights Act of 1875, lecturing that “there must be some stage
. . . when [Black Americans] tak[e] the rank of a mere
citizen, and ceas[e] to be the special favorite of the laws.”
Id., at 25. But Justice Harlan knew better. He responded:
“What the nation, through Congress, has sought to accomplish
in reference to [Black people] is—what had already been done
in every State of the Union for the white race—to secure and
protect rights belonging to them as freemen and citizens; nothing
more.” Id., at 61 (dissenting opinion).

															Justice Harlan dissented alone. And the betrayal
that this Court enabled had concrete effects. Enslaved Black people
had built great wealth, but only for enslavers.[10] No surprise, then, that freedmen leapt
at the chance to control their own labor and to build their own
financial security.[11]
Still, White southerners often “simply refused to sell land
to blacks,” even when not selling was economically
foolish.[12] To bolster
private exclusion, States sometimes passed laws forbidding such
sales.[13] The inability to
build wealth through that most American of means forced Black
people into sharecropping roles, where they somehow always tended
to find themselves in debt to the landowner when the growing season
closed, with no hope of recourse against the ever-present cooking
of the books.[14]

															Sharecropping is but one example of race-linked
obstacles that the law (and private parties) laid down to hinder
the progress and prosperity of Black people. Vagrancy laws
criminalized free Black men who failed to work for White
landlords.[15] Many States
barred freedmen from hunting or fishing to ensure that they could
not live without entering de facto reenslavement as
sharecroppers.[16] A
cornucopia of laws (e.g., banning hitchhiking, prohibiting
encouraging a laborer to leave his employer, and penalizing those
who prompted Black southerners to migrate northward) ensured that
Black people could not freely seek better lives elsewhere.[17] And when statutes did not ensure
compliance, state-sanctioned (and private) violence did.[18]

															Thus emerged Jim Crow—a system that was,
as much as anything else, a comprehensive scheme of economic
exploitation to replace the Black Codes, which themselves had
replaced slavery’s form of comprehensive economic
exploitation.[19] Meanwhile,
as Jim Crow ossified, the Federal Government was “giving away
land” on the western frontier, and with it “the
opportunity for upward mobility and a more secure future,”
over the 1862 Homestead Act’s three-quarter-century
tenure.[20] Black people
were exceedingly unlikely to be allowed to share in those benefits,
which by one calculation may have advantaged approximately 46
million Americans living today.[21]

															Despite these barriers, Black people persisted.
Their so-called Great Migration northward accelerated during and
after the First World War.[22] Like clockwork, American cities responded with
racially exclusionary zoning (and similar policies).[23] As a result, Black migrants had to pay
disproportionately high prices for disproportionately subpar
housing.[24] Nor did
migration make it more likely for Black people to access home
ownership, as banks would not lend to Black people, and in the rare
cases banks would fund home loans, exorbitant interest rates were
charged.[25] With Black
people still locked out of the Homestead Act giveaway, it is no
surprise that, when the Great Depression arrived, race-based
wealth, health, and opportunity gaps were the norm.[26]

															Federal and State Governments’ selective
intervention further exacerbated the disparities. Consider, for
example, the federal Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC),
created in 1933.[27] HOLC
purchased mortgages threatened with foreclosure and issued new,
amortized mortgages in their place.[28] Not only did this mean that recipients of these
mortgages could gain equity while paying off the loan, successful
full payment would make the recipient a homeowner.[29] Ostensibly to identify (and avoid) the
riskiest recipients, the HOLC “created color-coded maps of
every metropolitan area in the nation.”[30] Green meant safe; red meant risky. And,
regardless of class, every neighborhood with Black people earned
the red designation.[31]

															Similarly, consider the Federal Housing
Administration (FHA), created in 1934, which insured highly
desirable bank mortgages. Eligibility for this insurance required
an FHA appraisal of the property to ensure a low default
risk.[32] But, nationwide,
it was FHA’s established policy to provide “no
guarantees for mortgages to African Americans, or to whites who
might lease to African Americans,” irrespective of
creditworthiness.[33] No
surprise, then, that “[b]etween 1934 and 1968, 98 percent of
FHA loans went to white Americans,” with whole cities (ones
that had a disproportionately large number of Black people due to
housing segregation) sometimes being deemed ineligible for FHA
intervention on racial grounds.[34] The Veterans Administration operated
similarly.[35]

															One more example: the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board “chartered, insured, and regulated savings and loan
associations from the early years of the New Deal.”[36] But it did “not oppose the
denial of mortgages to African Americans until 1961” (and
even then opposed discrimination ineffectively).[37]

															The upshot of all this is that, due to
government policy choices, “[i]n the suburban-shaping years
between 1930 and 1960, fewer than one percent of all mortgages in
the nation were issued to African Americans.”[38] Thus, based on their race, Black people
were “[l]ocked out of the greatest mass-based opportunity for
wealth accumulation in American history.”[39]

															For present purposes, it is significant that, in
so excluding Black people, government policies affirmatively
operated—one could say, affirmatively acted—to dole out
preferences to those who, if nothing else, were not Black. Those
past preferences carried forward and are reinforced today by (among
other things) the benefits that flow to homeowners and to the
holders of other forms of capital that are hard to obtain unless
one already has assets.[40]

															This discussion of how the existing gaps were
formed is merely illustrative, not exhaustive. I will pass over
Congress’s repeated crafting of family-, worker-, and
retiree-protective legislation to channel benefits to White people,
thereby excluding Black Americans from what was otherwise “a
revolution in the status of most working Americans.”[41] I will also skip how the G. I.
Bill’s “creation of . . . middle-class
America” (by giving $95 billion to veterans and their
families between 1944 and 1971) was “deliberately designed to
accommodate Jim Crow.”[42] So, too, will I bypass how Black people were
prevented from partaking in the consumer credit market—a
market that helped White people who could access it build and
protect wealth.[43] Nor will
time and space permit my elaborating how local officials’
racial hostility meant that even those benefits that Black people
could formally obtain were unequally distributed along racial
lines.[44] And I could not
possibly discuss every way in which, in light of this history,
facially race-blind policies still work race-based harms
today (e.g., racially disparate tax-system treatment; the
disproportionate location of toxic-waste facilities in Black
communities; or the deliberate action of governments at all levels
in designing interstate highways to bisect and segregate Black
urban communities).[45]

															The point is this: Given our history, the origin
of persistent race-linked gaps should be no mystery. It has never
been a deficiency of Black Americans’ desire or ability to,
in Frederick Douglass’s words, “stand on [their] own
legs.”[46] Rather, it
was always simply what Justice Harlan recognized 140 years
ago—the persistent and pernicious denial of “what had
already been done in every State of the Union for the white
race.” Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S., at 61
(dissenting opinion).

															B

															History speaks. In some form, it can be heard
forever. The race-based gaps that first developed centuries ago are
echoes from the past that still exist today. By all accounts, they
are still stark.

															Start with wealth and income. Just four years
ago, in 2019, Black families’ median wealth was approximately
$24,000.[47] For White
families, that number was approximately eight times as much (about
$188,000).[48] These wealth
disparities “exis[t] at every income and education
level,” so, “[o]n average, white families with college
degrees have over $300,000 more wealth than black families with
college degrees.”[49]
This disparity has also accelerated over time—from a roughly
$40,000 gap between White and Black household median net worth in
1993 to a roughly $135,000 gap in 2019.[50] Median income numbers from 2019 tell the same
story: $76,057 for White households, $98,174 for Asian households,
$56,113 for Latino households, and $45,438 for Black
households.[51]

															These financial gaps are unsurprising in light
of the link between home ownership and wealth. Today, as was true
50 years ago, Black home ownership trails White home ownership by
approximately 25 percentage points.[52] Moreover, Black Americans’ homes (relative to
White Americans’) constitute a greater percentage of
household wealth, yet tend to be worth less, are subject to higher
effective property taxes, and generally lost more value in the
Great Recession.[53]

															From those markers of social and financial
unwellness flow others. In most state flagship higher educational
institutions, the percentage of Black undergraduates is lower than
the percentage of Black high school graduates in that
State.[54] Black Americans
in their late twenties are about half as likely as their White
counterparts to have college degrees.[55] And because lower family income and wealth force
students to borrow more, those Black students who do graduate
college find themselves four years out with about $50,000 in
student debt—nearly twice as much as their White
compatriots.[56]

															As for postsecondary professional arenas,
despite being about 13% of the population, Black people make up
only about 5% of lawyers.[57] Such disparity also appears in the business realm: Of
the roughly 1,800 chief executive officers to have appeared on the
well-known Fortune 500 list, fewer than 25 have been Black (as of
2022, only six are Black).[58] Furthermore, as the COVID–19 pandemic raged,
Black-owned small businesses failed at dramatically higher rates
than White-owned small businesses, partly due to the
disproportionate denial of the forgivable loans needed to survive
the economic downturn.[59]

															Health gaps track financial ones. When tested,
Black children have blood lead levels that are twice the rate of
White children—“irreversible” contamination
working irremediable harm on developing brains.[60] Black (and Latino) children with heart
conditions are more likely to die than their White
counterparts.[61]
Race-linked mortality-rate disparity has also persisted, and is
highest among infants.[62]

															So, too, for adults: Black men are twice as
likely to die from prostate cancer as White men and have lower
5-year cancer survival rates.[63] Uterine cancer has spiked in recent years among all
women—but has spiked highest for Black women, who die of
uterine cancer at nearly twice the rate of “any other racial
or ethnic group.”[64]
Black mothers are up to four times more likely than White mothers
to die as a result of childbirth.[65] And COVID killed Black Americans at higher rates than
White Americans.[66]

															“Across the board, Black Americans
experience the highest rates of obesity, hypertension, maternal
mortality, infant mortality, stroke, and asthma.”[67] These and other
disparities—the predictable result of opportunity
disparities—lead to at least 50,000 excess deaths a year for
Black Americans vis-à-vis White Americans.[68] That is 80 million excess years of life
lost from just 1999 through 2020.[69]

															Amici tell us that “race-linked
health inequities pervad[e] nearly every index of human
health” resulting “in an overall reduced life
expectancy for racial and ethnic minorities that cannot be
explained by genetics.”[70] Meanwhile—tying health and wealth
together—while she lays dying, the typical Black American
“pay[s] more for medical care and incur[s] more medical
debt.”[71]

															C

															We return to John and James now, with history
in hand. It is hardly John’s fault that he is the seventh
generation to graduate from UNC. UNC should permit him to honor
that legacy. Neither, however, was it James’s (or his
family’s) fault that he would be the first. And UNC ought to
be able to consider why.

															Most likely, seven generations ago, when
John’s family was building its knowledge base and wealth
potential on the university’s campus, James’s family
was enslaved and laboring in North Carolina’s fields. Six
generations ago, the North Carolina “Redeemers” aimed
to nullify the results of the Civil War through terror and
violence, marauding in hopes of excluding all who looked like James
from equal citizenship.[72]
Five generations ago, the North Carolina Red Shirts finished the
job.[73] Four (and three)
generations ago, Jim Crow was so entrenched in the State of North
Carolina that UNC “enforced its own Jim Crow
regulations.”[74] Two
generations ago, North Carolina’s Governor still railed
against “ ‘integration for integration’s
sake’ ”—and UNC Black enrollment was
minuscule.[75] So, at bare
minimum, one generation ago, James’s family was six
generations behind because of their race, making John’s six
generations ahead.

															These stories are not every student’s
story. But they are many students’ stories. To demand that
colleges ignore race in today’s admissions
practices—and thus disregard the fact that racial disparities
may have mattered for where some applicants find themselves
today—is not only an affront to the dignity of those students
for whom race matters.[76]
It also condemns our society to never escape the past that explains
how and why race matters to the very concept of who
“merits” admission.

															Permitting (not requiring) colleges like UNC to
assess merit fully, without blinders on, plainly advances (not
thwarts) the Fourteenth Amendment’s core promise. UNC
considers race as one of many factors in order to best assess the
entire unique import of John’s and James’s individual
lives and inheritances on an equal basis. Doing so involves
acknowledging (not ignoring) the seven generations’ worth of
historical privileges and disadvantages that each of these
applicants was born with when his own life’s journey started
a mere 18 years ago.

															II

															Recognizing all this, UNC has developed a
holistic review process to evaluate applicants for admission.
Students must submit standardized test scores and other
conventional information.[77] But applicants are not required to submit
demographic information like gender and race.[78] UNC considers whatever information each
applicant submits using a nonexhaustive list of 40 criteria grouped
into eight categories: “academic performance, academic
program, standardized testing, extracurricular activity, special
talent, essay criteria, background, and personal
criteria.”[79]

															Drawing on those 40 criteria, a UNC staff member
evaluating John and James would consider, with respect to each, his
“engagement outside the classroom; persistence of commitment;
demonstrated capacity for leadership; contributions to family,
school, and community; work history; [and his] unique or unusual
interests.”[80]
Relevant, too, would be his “relative advantage or
disadvantage, as indicated by family income level, education
history of family members, impact of parents/guardians in the home,
or formal education environment; experience of growing up in rural
or center-city locations; [and his] status as child or step-child
of Carolina alumni.”[81] The list goes on. The process is holistic, through
and through.

															So where does race come in? According to
UNC’s admissions-policy document, reviewers may also consider
“the race or ethnicity of any student” (if that
information is provided) in light of UNC’s interest in
diversity.[82] And, yes,
“the race or ethnicity of any student may—or may
not—receive a ‘plus’ in the evaluation process
depending on the individual circumstances revealed in the
student’s application.”[83] Stephen Farmer, the head of UNC’s Office of
Undergraduate Admissions, confirmed at trial (under oath) that
UNC’s admissions process operates in this fashion.[84]

															Thus, to be crystal clear: Every student
who chooses to disclose his or her race is eligible for such a
race-linked plus, just as any student who chooses to disclose his
or her unusual interests can be credited for what those interests
might add to UNC. The record supports no intimation to the
contrary. Eligibility is just that; a plus is never automatically
awarded, never considered in numerical terms, and never
automatically results in an offer of admission.[85] There are no race-based quotas in
UNC’s holistic review process.[86] In fact, during the admissions cycle, the school
prevents anyone who knows the overall racial makeup of the
admitted-student pool from reading any applications.[87]

															More than that, every applicant is also eligible
for a diversity-linked plus (beyond race) more generally.[88] And, notably, UNC understands
diversity broadly, including “socioeconomic status,
first-generation college status . . . political beliefs,
religious beliefs . . . diversity of thoughts,
experiences, ideas, and talents.”[89]

															A plus, by its nature, can certainly matter to
an admissions case. But make no mistake: When an applicant chooses
to disclose his or her race, UNC treats that aspect of identity on
par with other aspects of applicants’ identity that affect
who they are (just like, say, where one grew up, or medical
challenges one has faced).[90] And race is considered alongside any other factor
that sheds light on what attributes applicants will bring to the
campus and whether they are likely to excel once there.[91] A reader of today’s
majority opinion could be forgiven for misunderstanding how
UNC’s program really works, or for missing that, under
UNC’s holistic review process, a White student could receive
a diversity plus while a Black student might not.[92]

															UNC does not do all this to provide handouts to
either John or James. It does this to ascertain who among its tens
of thousands of applicants has the capacity to take full advantage
of the opportunity to attend, and contribute to, this prestigious
institution, and thus merits admission.[93] And UNC has concluded that ferreting this out
requires understanding the full person, which means taking
seriously not just SAT scores or whether the applicant plays the
trumpet, but also any way in which the applicant’s
race-linked experience bears on his capacity and merit. In this
way, UNC is able to value what it means for James, whose ancestors
received no race-based advantages, to make himself competitive for
admission to a flagship school nevertheless. Moreover, recognizing
this aspect of James’s story does not preclude UNC from
valuing John’s legacy or any obstacles that his story
reflects.

															So, to repeat: UNC’s program permits, but
does not require, admissions officers to value both John’s
and James’s love for their State, their high schools’
rigor, and whether either has overcome obstacles that are
indicative of their “persistence of
commitment.”[94] It
permits, but does not require, them to value John’s identity
as a child of UNC alumni (or, perhaps, if things had turned out
differently, as a first-generation White student from Appalachia
whose family struggled to make ends meet during the Great
Recession). And it permits, but does not require, them to value
James’s race—not in the abstract, but as an element of
who he is, no less than his love for his State, his high school
courses, and the obstacles he has overcome.

															Understood properly, then, what SFFA caricatures
as an unfair race-based preference cashes out, in a holistic
system, to a personalized assessment of the advantages and
disadvantages that every applicant might have received by accident
of birth plus all that has happened to them since. It ensures a
full accounting of everything that bears on the individual’s
resilience and likelihood of enhancing the UNC campus. It also
forecasts his potential for entering the wider world upon
graduation and making a meaningful contribution to the larger,
collective, societal goal that the Equal Protection Clause embodies
(its guarantee that the United States of America offers genuinely
equal treatment to every person, regardless of race).

															Furthermore, and importantly, the fact that
UNC’s holistic process ensures a full accounting makes it far
from clear that any particular applicant of color will finish ahead
of any particular nonminority applicant. For example, as the
District Court found, a higher percentage of the most academically
excellent in-state Black candidates (as SFFA’s expert defined
academic excellence) were denied admission than similarly qualified
White and Asian American applicants.[95] That, if nothing else, is indicative of a genuinely
holistic process; it is evidence that, both in theory and in
practice, UNC recognizes that race—like any other aspect of a
person—may bear on where both John and James start the
admissions relay, but will not fully determine whether either
eventually crosses the finish line.

															III

															A

															The majority seems to think that race
blindness solves the problem of race-based disadvantage. But the
irony is that requiring colleges to ignore the initial race-linked
opportunity gap between applicants like John and James will
inevitably widen that gap, not narrow it. It will delay the day
that every American has an equal opportunity to thrive, regardless
of race.

															SFFA similarly asks us to consider how much
longer UNC will be able to justify considering race in its
admissions process. Whatever the answer to that question was
yesterday, today’s decision will undoubtedly extend the
duration of our country’s need for such race consciousness,
because the justification for admissions programs that account for
race is inseparable from the race-linked gaps in health, wealth,
and well-being that still exist in our society (the closure of
which today’s decision will forestall).

															To be sure, while the gaps are stubborn and
pernicious, Black people, and other minorities, have generally been
doing better.[96] But those
improvements have only been made possible because institutions like
UNC have been willing to grapple forthrightly with the burdens of
history. SFFA’s complaint about the “indefinite”
use of race-conscious admissions programs, then, is a non sequitur.
These programs respond to deep-rooted, objectively measurable
problems; their definite end will be when we succeed, together, in
solving those problems.

															Accordingly, while there are many perversities
of today’s judgment, the majority’s failure to
recognize that programs like UNC’s carry with them the seeds
of their own destruction is surely one of them. The ultimate goal
of recognizing James’s full story and (potentially) admitting
him to UNC is to give him the necessary tools to contribute to
closing the equity gaps discussed in Part I, supra, so that
he, his progeny—and therefore all Americans—can compete
without race mattering in the future. That intergenerational
project is undeniably a worthy one.

															In addition, and notably, that end is not fully
achieved just because James is admitted. Schools properly care
about preventing racial isolation on campus because research shows
that it matters for students’ ability to learn and succeed
while in college if they live and work with at least some other
people who look like them and are likely to have similar
experiences related to that shared characteristic.[97] Equally critical, UNC’s program
ensures that students who don’t share the same stories (like
John and James) will interact in classes and on campus, and will
thereby come to understand each other’s stories, which
amici tell us improves cognitive abilities and critical-
thinking skills, reduces prejudice, and better prepares students
for postgraduate life.[98]

															Beyond campus, the diversity that UNC pursues
for the betterment of its students and society is not a trendy
slogan. It saves lives. For marginalized communities in North
Carolina, it is critically important that UNC and other area
institutions produce highly educated professionals of color.
Research shows that Black physicians are more likely to accurately
assess Black patients’ pain tolerance and treat them
accordingly (including, for example, prescribing them appropriate
amounts of pain medication).[99] For high-risk Black newborns, having a Black
physician more than doubles the likelihood that the baby will live,
and not die.[100] Studies
also confirm what common sense counsels: Closing wealth disparities
through programs like UNC’s—which, beyond diversifying
the medical profession, open doors to every sort of
opportunity—helps address the aforementioned health
disparities (in the long run) as well.[101]

															Do not miss the point that ensuring a diverse
student body in higher education helps everyone, not just
those who, due to their race, have directly inherited distinct
disadvantages with respect to their health, wealth, and well-
being. Amici explain that students of every race will come
to have a greater appreciation and understanding of civic virtue,
democratic values, and our country’s commitment to
equality.[102] The larger
economy benefits, too: When it comes down to the brass tacks of
dollars and cents, ensuring diversity will, if permitted to work,
help save hundreds of billions of dollars annually (by conservative
estimates).[103]

															Thus, we should be celebrating the fact that
UNC, once a stronghold of Jim Crow, has now come to understand
this. The flagship educational institution of a former Confederate
State has embraced its constitutional obligation to afford genuine
equal protection to applicants, and, by extension, to the broader
polity that its students will serve after graduation. Surely that
is progress for a university that once engaged in the kind of
patently offensive race- dominated admissions process that the
majority decries.

															With its holistic review process, UNC now treats
race as merely one aspect of an applicant’s life, when race
played a totalizing, all-encompassing, and singularly determinative
role for applicants like James for most of this country’s
history: No matter what else was true about him, being Black meant
he had no shot at getting in (the ultimate race-linked uneven
playing field). Holistic programs like UNC’s reflect the
reality that Black students have only relatively recently been
permitted to get into the admissions game at all. Such programs
also reflect universities’ clear-eyed optimism that, one day,
race will no longer matter.

															So much upside. Universal benefits ensue from
holistic admissions programs that allow consideration of all
factors material to merit (including race), and that thereby
facilitate diverse student populations. Once trained, those UNC
students who have thrived in the university’s diverse
learning environment are well equipped to make lasting
contributions in a variety of realms and with a variety of
colleagues, which, in turn, will steadily decrease the salience of
race for future generations. Fortunately, UNC and other
institutions of higher learning are already on this beneficial
path. In fact, all that they have needed to continue moving this
country forward (toward full achievement of our Nation’s
founding promises) is for this Court to get out of the way and let
them do their jobs. To our great detriment, the majority cannot
bring itself to do so.

															B

															The overarching reason the majority gives for
becoming an impediment to racial progress—that its own
conception of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection
Clause leaves it no other option—has a wholly
self-referential, two-dimensional flatness. The majority and
concurring opinions rehearse this Court’s idealistic vision
of racial equality, from Brown forward, with appropriate
lament for past indiscretions. See, e.g., ante, at
11. But the race-linked gaps that the law (aided by this Court)
previously founded and fostered—which indisputably define our
present reality—are strangely absent and do not seem to
matter.

															With let-them-eat-cake obliviousness, today, the
majority pulls the ripcord and announces “colorblindness for
all” by legal fiat. But deeming race irrelevant in law does
not make it so in life. And having so detached itself from this
country’s actual past and present experiences, the Court has
now been lured into interfering with the crucial work that UNC and
other institutions of higher learning are doing to solve
America’s real-world problems.

															No one benefits from ignorance. Although formal
race-linked legal barriers are gone, race still matters to the
lived experiences of all Americans in innumerable ways, and
today’s ruling makes things worse, not better. The best that
can be said of the majority’s perspective is that it proceeds
(ostrich-like) from the hope that preventing consideration of race
will end racism. But if that is its motivation, the majority
proceeds in vain. If the colleges of this country are required to
ignore a thing that matters, it will not just go away. It will take
longer for racism to leave us. And, ultimately, ignoring
race just makes it matter more.[104]

															The only way out of this morass—for all of
us—is to stare at racial disparity unblinkingly, and then do
what evidence and experts tell us is required to level the playing
field and march forward together, collectively striving to achieve
true equality for all Americans. It is no small irony that the
judgment the majority hands down today will forestall the end of
race-based disparities in this country, making the colorblind world
the majority wistfully touts much more difficult to accomplish.

															*  *  *

															As the Civil War neared its conclusion,
General William T. Sherman and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton
convened a meeting of Black leaders in Savannah, Georgia. During
the meeting, someone asked Garrison Frazier, the group’s
spokesperson, what “freedom” meant to him. He answered,
“ ‘placing us where we could reap the fruit of our
own labor, and take care of ourselves . . . to have land,
and turn it and till it by our own
labor.’ ”[105]

															Today’s gaps exist because that freedom
was denied far longer than it was ever afforded. Therefore, as
Justice Sotomayor correctly and amply explains, UNC’s
holistic review program pursues a righteous end—legitimate
“ ‘because it is defined by the Constitution
itself. The end is the maintenance of freedom.’ ”
Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392
U.S. 409, 443–444 (1968) (quoting Cong. Globe, 39th
Cong., 1st Sess., 1118 (1866) (Rep. Wilson)).

															Viewed from this perspective, beleaguered
admissions programs such as UNC’s are not pursuing a patently
unfair, ends-justified ideal of a multiracial democracy at all.
Instead, they are engaged in an earnest effort to secure a more
functional one. The admissions rubrics they have constructed now
recognize that an individual’s “merit”—his
ability to succeed in an institute of higher learning and
ultimately contribute something to our society—cannot be
fully determined without understanding that individual in full.
There are no special favorites here.

															UNC has thus built a review process that more
accurately assesses merit than most of the admissions programs
that have existed since this country’s founding. Moreover, in
so doing, universities like UNC create pathways to upward mobility
for long excluded and historically disempowered racial groups. Our
Nation’s history more than justifies this course of action.
And our present reality indisputably establishes that such programs
are still needed—for the general public good—because
after centuries of state- sanctioned (and enacted) race
discrimination, the aforementioned intergenerational race-based
gaps in health, wealth, and well-being stubbornly persist.

															Rather than leaving well enough alone, today,
the majority is having none of it. Turning back the clock (to a
time before the legal arguments and evidence establishing the
soundness of UNC’s holistic admissions approach existed), the
Court indulges those who either do not know our Nation’s
history or long to repeat it. Simply put, the race-blind admissions
stance the Court mandates from this day forward is unmoored from
critical real-life circumstances. Thus, the Court’s meddling
not only arrests the noble generational project that
America’s universities are attempting, it also launches, in
effect, a dismally misinformed sociological experiment.

															Time will reveal the results. Yet the
Court’s own missteps are now both eternally memorialized and
excruciatingly plain. For one thing—based, apparently, on
nothing more than Justice Powell’s initial say so—it
drastically discounts the primary reason that the racial-diversity
objectives it excoriates are needed, consigning race-related
historical happenings to the Court’s own analytical dustbin.
Also, by latching onto arbitrary timelines and professing
insecurity about missing metrics, the Court sidesteps unrefuted
proof of the compelling benefits of holistic admissions programs
that factor in race (hard to do, for there is plenty), simply
proceeding as if no such evidence exists. Then, ultimately, the
Court surges to vindicate equality, but Don Quixote
style—pitifully perceiving itself as the sole vanguard of
legal high ground when, in reality, its perspective is not
constitutionally compelled and will hamper the best judgments of
our world-class educational institutions about who they need to
bring onto their campuses right now to benefit every American, no
matter their race.[106]

															The Court has come to rest on the bottom-line
conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth
potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare
Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success
in the bunker, not the boardroom (a particularly awkward place to
land, in light of the history the majority opts to
ignore).[107] It would be
deeply unfortunate if the Equal Protection Clause actually demanded
this perverse, ahistorical, and counterproductive outcome. To
impose this result in that Clause’s name when it requires no
such thing, and to thereby obstruct our collective progress toward
the full realization of the Clause’s promise, is truly a
tragedy for us all.

92  A
reader might miss this because the majority does not bother todrill
down on how UNC’s holistic admissions process operates.
Perhaps that explains its failure to apprehend (by reviewing the
evidence presented at trial) that everyone, no matter their race,
is eligible for a diversity-linked plus. Compare ante, at 5,
and n. 1, with 3 App. 1416, and supra, at 17. The
majority also repeatedly mischaracterizes UNC’s holistic
admissions-review process as a “race-based admissions
system,” and insists that UNC’s program involves
“separating students on the basis of race” and
“pick[ing only certain] races to benefit.” Ante,
at 5, and n. 1, 26, 38. These claims would be concerning if
they had any basis in the record. The majority appears to have
misunderstood (or categorically rejected) the established fact that
UNC treats race as merely one of the many aspects of an applicant
that, in the real world, matter to understanding the whole person.
Moreover, its holistic review process involves reviewing a wide
variety of personal criteria, not just race. Every applicant
competes against thousands of other applicants, each of whom has
personal qualities that are taken into account and that other
applicants do not—and could not—have. Thus, the
elimination of the race-linked plus would still leave
SFFA’s members competing against thousands of other
applicants to UNC, each of whom has potentially plus-conferring
qualities that a given SFFA member does not.

95  See
567 F. Supp. 3d, at 617, 619; 3 App. 1078–1080. The
majority cannot deny this factual finding. Instead, it conducts its
own back-of-the-envelope calculations (its numbers appear nowhere
in the District Court’s opinion) regarding “the
overall acceptance rates of academically excellent
applicants to UNC,” in an effort to trivialize the District
Court’s conclusion. Ante, at 5, n. 1. I am
inclined to stick with the District Court’s findings over the
majority’s unauthenticated calculations. Even when the
majority’s ad hoc statistical analysis is taken at face
value, it hardly supports what the majority wishes to intimate:
that Black students are being admitted based on UNC’s myopic
focus on “race—and race alone.” Ante, at
28, n. 6. As the District Court observed, if these Black
students “were largely defined in the admissions process by
their race, one would expect to find that every” such
student “demonstrating academic excellence . . .
would be admitted.” 567 F. Supp. 3d, at 619 (emphasis
added). Contrary to the majority’s narrative, “race
does not even act as a tipping point for some students with
otherwise exceptional qualifications.” Ibid. Moreover,
as the District Court also found, UNC does not even use the bespoke
“academic excellence” metric that SFFA’s expert
“ ‘invented’ ” for this
litigation. Id., at 617, 619; see also id., at
624–625. The majority’s calculations of overall
acceptance rates by race on that metric bear scant
relationship to, and thus are no indictment of, how UNC’s
admissions process actually works (a recurring theme in its
opinion).

104  Justice Thomas’s prolonged
attack, ante, at 49–55 (concurring opinion), responds
to a dissent I did not write in order to assail an admissions
program that is not the one UNC has crafted. He does not dispute
any historical or present fact about the origins and continued
existence of race-based disparity (nor could he), yet is somehow
persuaded that these realities have no bearing on a fair assessment
of “individual achievement,” ante, at 51.
Justice Thomas’s opinion also demonstrates an obsession with
race consciousness that far outstrips my or UNC’s holistic
understanding that race can be a factor that affects
applicants’ unique life experiences. How else can one explain
his detection of “an organizing principle based on
race,” a claim that our society is “fundamentally
racist,” and a desire for Black “victimhood” or
racial “silo[s],” ante, at 49–52, in this
dissent’s approval of an admissions program that advances all
Americans’ shared pursuit of true equality by treating race
“on par with” other aspects of identity, supra,
at 18? Justice Thomas ignites too many more straw men to list, or
fully extinguish, here. The takeaway is that those who demand that
no one think about race (a classic pink-elephant paradox) refuse to
see, much less solve for, the elephant in the room—the
race-linked disparities that continue to impede achievement of our
great Nation’s full potential. Worse still, by insisting that
obvious truths be ignored, they prevent our problem-solving
institutions from directly addressing the real import and impact of
“social racism” and “government-imposed
racism,” ante, at 55 (Thomas, J., concurring), thereby
deterring our collective progression toward becoming a society
where race no longer matters.

why the majority’s analysis is legally erroneous and how
UNC’s holistic review program is entirely consistent with the
Fourteenth Amendment. My goal here has been to highlight the
interests at stake and to show that holistic admissions programs
that factor in race are warranted, just, and universally
beneficial. All told, the Court’s myopic misunderstanding of
what the Constitution permits will impede what experts and evidence
tell us is required (as a matter of social science) to solve for
pernicious race-based inequities that are themselves rooted in the
persistent denial of equal protection. “[T]he potential
