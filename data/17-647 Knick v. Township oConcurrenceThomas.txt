															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 17–647

															_________________

															ROSE MARY KNICK, PETITIONER v. TOWNSHIP
OF SCOTT, PENNSYLVANIA, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the third circuit

															[June 21, 2019]

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															The Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause
prohibits the government from “tak[ing]” private
property “without just compensation.” The Court
correctly interprets this text by holding that a violation of this
Clause occurs as soon as the government takes property without
paying for it.

															The United States, by contrast, urges us not to
enforce the Takings Clause as written. It worries that requiring
payment to accompany a taking would allow courts to enjoin or
invalidate broad regulatory programs “merely” because
the program takes property without paying for it. Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 12. According to the United States,
“there is a ‘nearly infinite variety of ways in which
government actions or regulations can affect property
interests,’ ” and it ought to be good enough that
the government “implicitly promises to pay compensation for
any taking” if a property owner successfully sues the
government in court. Supplemental Letter Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 5 (Supp. Brief) (citing the Tucker Act, 28
U. S. C. §1491). Government officials, the United
States contends, should be able to implement regulatory programs
“without fear” of injunction or invalidation under the
Takings Clause, “even when” the program is so far
reaching that the officials “cannot determine whether a
taking will occur.” Supp. Brief 5.

															This “sue me” approach to the
Takings Clause is untenable. The Fifth Amendment does not merely
provide a damages remedy to a property owner willing to
“shoulder the burden of securing compensation” after
the government takes property without paying for it. Arrigoni
Enterprises, LLC v. Durham, 578 U. S. ___, ___
(2016) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip
op., at 2). Instead, it makes just compensation a
“prerequisite” to the government’s authority to
“tak[e] property for public use.” Ibid. A
“purported exercise of the eminent-domain power” is
therefore “invalid” unless the government “pays
just compensation before or at the time of its taking.”
Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3). If this requirement makes some
regulatory programs “unworkable in practice,” Supp.
Brief 5, so be it—our role is to enforce the Takings Clause
as written.

															Of course, as the Court correctly explains, the
United States’ concerns about injunctions may be misplaced.
Ante, at 15–18. Injunctive relief is not available
when an adequate remedy exists at law. E.g., Monsanto
Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561
U.S. 139, 156 (2010). And even when relief is appropriate for a
particular plaintiff, it does not follow that a court may enjoin or
invalidate an entire regulatory “program,” Supp. Brief
5, by granting relief “beyond the parties to the case,”
Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018)
(Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6); see id., at ___
(slip op., at 2) (expressing skepticism about “universal
injunctions”).

															Still, “[w]hen the government repudiates
[its] duty” to pay just compensation, its actions “are
not only unconstitutional” but may be “tortious as
well.” Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey,
Ltd., 526 U.S.
687, 717 (1999) (plurality opinion). I do not understand the
Court’s opinion to foreclose the application of ordinary
remedial principles to takings claims and related common-law tort
claims, such as trespass. I therefore join it in full.
