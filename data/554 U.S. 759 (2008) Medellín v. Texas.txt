															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 06–984

															_________________

															

															Per Curiam.

															Petitioner seeks a stay of execution on the
theory that either Congress or the Legislature of the State of
Texas might determine that actions of the International Court of
Justice (ICJ) should be given controlling weight in determining
that a violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations is
grounds for vacating the sentence imposed in this suit. Under
settled principles, these possibilities are too remote to justify
an order from this Court staying the sentence imposed by the Texas
courts. And neither the President nor the Governor of the State of
Texas has represented to us that there is any likelihood of
congressional or state legislative action.

															It is up to Congress whether to implement
obligations undertaken under a treaty which (like this one) does
not itself have the force and effect of domestic law sufficient to
set aside the judgment or the ensuing sentence, and Congress has
not progressed beyond the bare introduction of a bill in the four
years since the ICJ ruling and the four months since our ruling in
Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. ___ (2008). This inaction is
consistent with the President's decision in 2005 to withddraw the
United States' accession to jurisdiction of the ICJ with regard to
matters arising under the Convention.

															The beginning premise for any stay, and indeed
for the assumption that Congress or the legislature might seek to
intervene in this suit, must be that petitioner's confession was
obtained unlawfully. This is highly unlikely as a matter of
domestic or international law. Other arguments seeking to establish
that a violation of the Convention constitutes grounds for showing
the invalidity of the state court judgment, for instance because
counsel was inadequate, are also insubstantial, for the reasons
noted in our previous opinion. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).

															The Department of Justice of the United States
is well aware of these proceedings and has not chosen to seek our
intervention. Its silence is no surprise: The United States has not
wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his
lack of consular access.

															The application to recall and stay the mandate
and for stay of execution of sentence of death, presented to
JUSTICE SCALIA, and by him referred to the Court, is denied. The
application for stay of execution of sentence of death, presented
to JUSTICE SCALIA, and by him referred to the Court, is denied. The
petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied.

															It is so ordered.
