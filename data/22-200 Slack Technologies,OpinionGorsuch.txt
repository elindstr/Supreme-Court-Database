NOLOGIES, INC., et al., PETITIONERS v. FIYYAZ
PIRANI

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 1, 2023]

															

															Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															This case concerns the meaning of one provision
of the federal securities laws. For many years, lower federal
courts have held that liability under §11 of the Securities
Act of 1933 attaches only when a buyer can trace the shares he has
purchased to a false or misleading registration statement.
Recently, the Ninth Circuit parted ways with these decisions,
holding that a plaintiff may sometimes recover under §11 even
when the shares he owns are not traceable to a defective
registration statement. The question we face is which of these
approaches best conforms to the statute’s terms.

															I

															Together, the Securities Act of 1933, 48Stat.
74, 15 U. S. C. §77a et seq., and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48Stat. 881, 15 U. S. C.
§78a et seq., form the backbone of American
securities law. The first is
“ ‘narrower’ ” and focused
“ ‘primarily’ ” on the regulation
of new offerings. Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S.
561, 572 (1995) (quoting Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor
Drug Stores, 421 U.S.
723, 752 (1975)). Generally speaking, the 1933 Act requires a
company to register the securities it intends to offer to the
public with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). See,
e.g., 15 U. S. C. §§77b(a)(8), 77e; see
also §77d. As part of that process, a company must prepare a
registration statement that includes detailed information about the
firm’s business and financial health so prospective buyers
may fairly assess whether to invest. See, e.g.,
§§77f, 77g, 77aa. The law imposes strict liability on
issuing companies when their registration statements contain
material misstatements or misleading omissions. §77k; see also
Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S.
375, 380 (1983).

															The 1934 Act sweeps more broadly. Among other
things, it requires publicly traded companies to provide ongoing
disclosures and regulates trading on secondary markets. See,
e.g., §§78m, 78o; T. Hazen, Federal Securities Law
99–102 (4th ed. 2022) (Hazen). This law’s main
liability provision sweeps more broadly too. It allows suits in
connection with the purchase or sale of “any security,”
whether registered or not. §78j(b); see also 17 CFR
§240.10b–5 (2022); Herman & MacLean, 459
U. S., at 382. But to prevail under this provision, a
plaintiff must prove that any material misleading statement or
omission was made “with scienter, i.e., with intent to
deceive, manipulate, or defraud.” Id., at 382.

															This case arises from a public offering governed
by the 1933 Act. Typically, when a company goes public it issues
new shares pursuant to a registration statement. That registration
statement is filed with the SEC and made available to the public.
Investment banks underwrite the offering, usually by buying these
new registered shares at a negotiated price and then selling them
to investors at a higher price. In this way, underwriters often
carry the risk of loss should they fail to sell the shares at a
profit. See 1 L. Loss, J. Seligman, & T. Paredes, Securities
Regulation 738–748 (6th ed. 2019); Hazen 32–33.

															Of course, a company’s early investors and
employees may own preexisting shares. Often, too, these shares are
not subject to registration requirements. See, e.g., 15
U. S. C. §77d(a)(2) (exempting, among other things,
transactions “not involving any public offering”); 17
CFR §230.144(a)(3)(i) (recognizing as exempt certain
securities “acquired directly . . . from the issuer
. . . in a transaction or chain of transactions not
involving any public offering”); Hazen 60–61. To
prevent the stock price from falling once public trading begins,
underwriters may require insiders to consent to a “lockup
agreement”—a commitment to hold their unregistered
shares for a period of time before selling them on the new public
market. See 1 J. Bartlett, Equity Finance: Venture Capital,
Buyouts, Restructurings and Reorganizations §14.8, p. 333
(2d ed. 1995).

															Initial public offerings (IPOs) are an effective
way of raising capital, but they also have drawbacks. Among other
things, they can involve significant transaction costs. Nor is
raising capital the only reason firms might wish to go public; some
may simply wish to afford their shareholders (whether investors,
employees, or others) the convenience of being able to sell their
existing shares on a public exchange. See 73 Fed. Reg. 54442
(2008). Several years ago, a number of companies approached the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) about the possibility of selling shares
publicly on that exchange without an IPO. Ibid. Ultimately,
the NYSE proposed rules to facilitate and regulate these
“direct listings,” which the SEC approved with
modifications. 83 Fed. Reg. 5650 (2018).

															Slack is a technology company that offers a
platform for instant messaging. It conducted a direct listing on
the NYSE in 2019. Pirani v. Slack Technologies, Inc.,
13 F. 4th 940, 944, 947 (CA9 2021). As part of that process,
Slack filed a registration statement for a specified number of
registered shares it intended to offer in its direct listing.
Pirani v. Slack Technologies, Inc., 445 F. Supp.
3d 367, 373 (ND Cal. 2020). But because Slack employed a direct
listing rather than an IPO, there was no underwriter and no lockup
agreement. 13 F. 4th, at 951 (Miller, J., dissenting).
Accordingly, holders of preexisting unregistered shares were free
to sell them to the public right away. See ibid. All told,
Slack’s direct listing offered for purchase 118 million
registered shares and 165 million unregistered shares.

															Fiyyaz Pirani bought 30,000 Slack shares on the
day Slack went public. He bought 220,000 additional shares over the
next few months. When the stock price later dropped, Mr. Pirani
filed a class-action lawsuit against Slack. In that suit, he
alleged that Slack had violated §§11 and 12 of the 1933
Act by filing a materially misleading registration statement.
Ibid.

															Slack moved to dismiss the complaint for failure
to state a claim. Sections 11 and 12, Slack argued, authorize suit
only for those who hold shares issued pursuant to a false or
misleading registration statement. And this feature of the law, the
company said, was dispositive in this case because Mr. Pirani had
not alleged that he purchased shares traceable to the allegedly
misleading registration statement. For all anyone could tell, he
may have purchased unregistered shares unconnected to the
registration statement and its representations about the
firm’s business and financial health. Of course, Slack would
go on to acknowledge that the 1934 Act allows investors to recover
for fraud in the sale of unregistered shares upon proof of
scienter. But, the company emphasized, Mr. Pirani had not sought to
sue under that law.

															Ultimately, the district court denied the motion
to dismiss but certified its ruling for interlocutory appeal. 445
F. Supp. 3d, at 381, 384–385. The Ninth Circuit accepted
the appeal and a divided panel affirmed. 13 F. 4th, at 945,
950. In dissent, Judge Miller argued that §§11 and 12 of
the 1933 Act require a plaintiff to plead and prove that he
purchased securities registered under a materially misleading
registration statement, something Mr. Pirani had not done.
Id., at 951–952. Judge Miller pointed out that a long
line of lower court cases have interpreted §11 as applying
only to shares purchased pursuant to a registration statement.
Id., at 952. Because the Ninth Circuit’s decision
created a split of authority in the courts of appeals about
§11’s scope, we granted certiorari. 598 U. S. ___
(2022).[1]

															II

															We begin with the relevant language of
§11(a) of the 1933 Act. It provides:

															“In case any part of the
registration statement, when such part became effective, contained
an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, any person acquiring such
security (unless it is proved that at the time of such acquisition
he knew of such untruth or omission) may, either at law or in
equity, in any court of competent jurisdiction, sue [certain
enumerated parties].” 15 U. S. C. §77k(a).

															The statute authorizes an individual to sue for
a material misstatement or omission in a registration statement
when he has acquired “such security.” The question we
face is what this means. Does the term “such security”
refer to a security issued pursuant to the allegedly misleading
registration statement? Or can the term also sometimes encompass a
security that was not issued pursuant to the allegedly misleading
registration statement? Slack advances the first interpretation;
Mr. Pirani defends the second.

															Immediately, we face a bit of a challenge. The
word “such” usually refers to something that has
already been “described” or that is “implied or
intelligible from the context or circumstances.” Concise
Oxford Dictionary of Current English 1218 (1931); see also
Webster’s New International Dictionary 2518 (2d ed. 1954).
But there is no clear referent in §11(a) telling us what
“such security” means. As a result, we must ascertain
the statute’s critical referent “from the context or
circumstances.”

															As it turns out, context provides several clues.
For one thing, the statute imposes liability for false statements
or misleading omissions in “the registration
statement.” §77k (emphasis added). Not just a
registration statement or any registration statement. The statute
uses the definite article to reference the particular registration
statement alleged to be misleading, and in this way seems to
suggest the plaintiff must “acquir[e] such security”
under that document’s terms. Ibid.

															For another thing, the statute repeatedly uses
the word “such” to narrow the law’s focus. The
statute directs us to “such part” of the registration
statement that contains a misstatement or misleading omission. It
speaks of “such acquisition” when a person has acquired
securities pursuant to the registration statement. And it points to
“such untruth or omission” found in the registration
statement. Each time, the law trains our view on particular things
or statements. All of which suggests that, when it comes to
“such security,” the law speaks to a security
registered under the particular registration statement alleged to
contain a falsehood or misleading omission.

															Other provisions in the 1933 Act follow suit.
Under §5, for example, “[u]nless a registration
statement is in effect as to a security,” it is unlawful
“to sell such security.” §77e(a). Here, the term
“such security” clearly refers to shares subject to
registration. Meanwhile, §6 provides that a
“registration statement shall be deemed effective only as to
the securities specified therein as proposed to be offered.”
§77f(a). It’s an instruction that would seem hard to
square with Mr. Pirani’s broader reading of
§11(a)—after all, adopting that reading would give the
registration statement effect (in the sense of creating liability)
for securities that are not “specified” in the
registration statement “as proposed to be offered.”

															Beyond these clues lies still another. Section
11(e) caps damages against an underwriter in a §11 suit to the
“total price at which the securities underwritten by him and
distributed to the public were offered to the public.”
§77k(e). This provision thus ties the maximum available
recovery to the value of the registered shares alone. It’s
another feature that makes little sense on Mr. Pirani’s
account, for if §11(a) liability extended beyond registered
shares presumably available damages would too. See Barnes v.
Osofsky, 373 F.2d 269, 272 (CA2 1967); Brief for SEC as
Amicus Curiae in Barnes v. Osofsky, No. 30867
etc. (CA2), pp. 4–5.

															Collectively, these contextual clues persuade us
that Slack’s reading of the law is the better one. Nor is
anything we say here particularly novel. For while direct listings
are new, the question how far §11(a) liability extends is not.
More than half a century ago, Judge Friendly addressed the question
in an opinion for the Second Circuit in Barnes and concluded
that “the narrower reading” we adopt today is the more
“natural” one. 373 F. 2d, at 271, 273. Since
Barnes, every court of appeals to consider the issue has
reached the same conclusion: To bring a claim under §11, the
securities held by the plaintiff must be traceable to the
particular registration statement alleged to be false or
misleading.[2] Until this
decision, even the Ninth Circuit seemed to take the same view.
Hertzberg v. Dignity Partners, Inc., 
191 F.3d 1076, 1080, and n. 4 (1999).

															Resisting this conclusion, Mr. Pirani argues
that we should read the phrase “such security” to
include not only securities traceable to a defective registration
statement. We should also read the phrase to include other
securities that bear some sort of minimal relationship to a
defective registration statement. And, he argues, a reading like
that would allow his case to proceed because, but for the existence
of Slack’s registration statement for the registered shares,
its unregistered shares would not have been eligible for sale to
the public. Brief for Respondent 22–23. Beyond assuring us
that the rule he proposes would save his case, however, Mr. Pirani
does not offer much more. He does not explain what the limits of
his rule would be, how we might derive them from §11, or how
any of this can be squared with the various contextual clues we
have encountered suggesting that liability runs with registered
shares alone.

															Perhaps the closest Mr. Pirani comes to
answering these questions comes when he directs us to §5. If
Congress wanted liability under §11(a) to attach only to
securities issued pursuant to a particular registration statement,
he observes, it could have simply borrowed similar language from
§5. That provision, he stresses, speaks of “any security
with respect to which a registration statement has been
filed.” §77e(b)(1). But even taken on its own terms,
this argument does not prove much. If Mr. Pirani’s example
shows that Congress could have written §11(a) to explain more
clearly that liability attaches only to securities issued pursuant
to a particular registration statement, it also shows that Congress
could have written §11(a) to explain more clearly that
liability attaches to “any security” or “any
security” bearing some specified relationship to a
registration statement. That Congress could have been clearer, no
one disputes. But none of this proves it adopted anything like the
rule Mr. Pirani proposes.

															Finally, Mr. Pirani argues from policy and
purpose. Adopting a broader reading of “such security”
would, he says, expand liability for falsehoods and misleading
omissions and thus better accomplish the purpose of the 1933 Act.
We cannot endorse this line of reasoning. This Court does not
“presume . . . that any result consistent with [one
party’s] account of the statute’s overarching goal must
be the law.” Henson v. Santander Consumer USA
Inc., 582 U.S. 79, 89 (2017). Nor, for that matter, is Mr.
Pirani’s account of the law’s purpose altogether
obvious. As we have seen, the 1933 Act is “limited in
scope.” Herman & MacLean, 459 U. S., at 382.
Its main liability provision imposes strict liability on issuers
for material falsehoods or misleading omissions in the registration
statement. Ibid. Meanwhile, the 1934 Act requires ongoing
disclosures for publicly traded companies and its main liability
provision allows suits involving any sale of a security but only on
proof of scienter. Ibid.; Hazen 99–100. Given this
design, it seems equally possible that Congress sought a balanced
liability regime that allows a narrow class of claims to proceed on
lesser proof but requires a higher standard of proof to sustain a
broader set of claims.

															III

															Naturally, Congress remains free to revise the
securities laws at any time, whether to address the rise of direct
listings or any other development. Our only function lies in
discerning and applying the law as we find it. And because we think
the better reading of the particular provision before us requires a
plaintiff to plead and prove that he purchased shares traceable to
the allegedly defective registration statement, we vacate the Ninth
Circuit’s judgment holding otherwise. Whether Mr.
Pirani’s pleadings can satisfy §11(a) as properly
construed, we leave for that court to decide in the first instance
on remand.[3]

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 The parties have
litigated this case on the premise that Slack was not required to
register all of the shares sold in its direct listing. For the
first time before this Court, Mr. Pirani challenges that premise,
suggesting that it was incumbent on Slack to register all the
securities sold in its direct listings on the NYSE. Brief for
Respondent 11–12, n. 7. As he acknowledges, however,
this issue is not properly presented for decision, ibid.,
and so we do not pass upon it.

 As we noted at the
outset, the parties do not just spar over the best interpretation
of §11 and its application to this case. They do the same when
it comes to §12. See Part I, supra. But we have no need
to reach the merits of that particular dispute. The Ninth Circuit
said that its decision to permit Mr. Pirani’s §12 claim
to proceed “follow[ed] from” its analysis of his
§11 claim. 13 F. 4th 940, 949 (2021). And because we find that
court’s §11 analysis flawed, we think the best course is
to vacate its judgment with respect to Mr. Pirani’s §12
claim as well for reconsideration in the light of our holding today
about the meaning of §11. In doing so, we express no views
about the proper interpretation of §12 or its application to
this case. Nor do we endorse the Ninth Circuit’s apparent
belief that §11 and §12 necessarily travel together, but
instead caution that the two provisions contain distinct language
that warrants careful consideration.
