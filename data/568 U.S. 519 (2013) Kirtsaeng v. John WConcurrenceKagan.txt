															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															SUPAP KIRTSAENG, dba BLUECHRISTINE99,
PETITIONER v. JOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[March 19, 2013]

															

															Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Alito joins,
concurring.

															I concur fully in the Court’s opinion.
Neither the text nor the history of 17 U. S. C.
§109(a) supports removing first-sale protection from every
copy of a protected work manufactured abroad. See ante, at
8–16, 28–31. I recognize, however, that the combination
of today’s decision and Quality King Distributors,
Inc. v. L’anza Research Int’l, Inc.,
523 U.S.
135 (1998), constricts the scope of §602(a)(1)’s ban
on unauthorized importation. I write to suggest that any problems
associated with that limitation come not from our reading of
§109(a) here, but from Qual- ity King’s holding
that §109(a) limits §602(a)(1).

															As the Court explains, the first-sale doctrine
has played an integral part in American copyright law for over a
century. See ante, at 17–19; Bobbs-Merrill
Co. v. Straus, 210 U.S.
339 (1908). No codification of the doctrine prior to 1976 even
arguably limited its application to copies made in the United
States. See ante, at 12. And nothing in the text or history
of §109(a)—the Copyright Act of 1976’s first-sale
provision—suggests that Congress meant to enact the new,
geographical restriction John Wiley proposes, which at once would
deprive American consumers of important rights and encourage
copyright holders to manufacture abroad. See ante, at
8–16, 28–31.

															That said, John Wiley is right that the
Court’s decision, when combined with Quality King,
substantially narrows §602(a)(1)’s ban on unauthorized
importation. Quality King held that the importation ban does
not reach any copies receiving first-sale protection under
§109(a). See 523 U. S., at 151–152. So
notwithstanding §602(a)(1), an “owner of a particular
copy . . . lawfully made under this title” can
import that copy without the copyright owner’s permission.
§109(a). In now holding that copies “lawfully made under
this title” include copies manufactured abroad, we
unavoidably diminish §602(a)(1)’s scope—indeed,
limit it to a fairly esoteric set of applications. See ante,
at 26–27.

															But if Congress views the shrinking of
§602(a)(1) as a problem, it should recognize Quality
King—not our decision today—as the culprit. Here,
after all, we merely construe §109(a); Quality King is
the decision holding that §109(a) limits §602(a)(1). Had
we come out the opposite way in that case, §602(a)(1) would
allow a copyright owner to restrict the importation of copies
irrespective of the first-sale doctrine.[1] That result would enable the copyright owner to
divide international markets in the way John Wiley claims Congress
intended when enacting §602(a)(1). But it would do so without
imposing downstream liability on those who purchase and resell in
the United States copies that happen to have been manu- factured
abroad. In other words, that outcome would tar- get unauthorized
importers alone, and not the “libraries, used-book dealers,
technology companies, consumer-goods retailers, and museums”
with whom the Court today is rightly concerned. Ante, at 19.
Assuming Congress adopted §602(a)(1) to permit market
segmentation, I sus- pect that is how Congress thought the
provision would work—not by removing first-sale protection
from every copy manufactured abroad (as John Wiley urges us to do
here), but by enabling the copyright holder to control imports even
when the first-sale doctrine applies (as Quality King now
prevents).[2]

															At bottom, John Wiley (together with the
dissent) asks us to misconstrue §109(a) in order to restore
§602(a)(1) to its purportedly rightful function of enabling
copyright holders to segment international markets. I think John
Wiley may have a point about what §602(a)(1) was designed to
do; that gives me pause about Quality King’s holding
that the first-sale doctrine limits the importation ban’s
scope. But the Court today correctly declines the invitation to
save §602(a)(1) from Quality King by destroying the
first-sale protection that §109(a) gives to every owner of a
copy manufactured abroad. That would swap one (possible) mistake
for a much worse one, and make our reading of the statute only less
reflective of Congressional intent. If Congress thinks copyright
owners need greater power to restrict importation and thus divide
markets, a ready solution is at hand—not the one John Wiley
offers in this case, but the one the Court rejected in Quality
King.

Notes
1
 Although Quality
King concluded that the statute’s text foreclosed that
outcome, see 523 U. S., at 151–152, the Solicitor
General offered a cogent argument to the contrary. He reasoned that
§109(a) does not limit §602(a)(1) because the former
authorizes owners only to “sell” or
“dispose” of copies—not to import them: The
Act’s first-sale provision and its importation ban thus
regulate separate, non-overlapping spheres of conduct. See Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae in Quality King,
O. T. 1996, No. 96–1470, pp. 5, 8–10. That reading
remains the Government’s preferred way of construing the
statute. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44 (“[W]e think that we still
would adhere to our view that section 109(a) should not be read as
a limitation on section 602(a)(1)”); see also ante, at
32–33; post, at 21, n. 15 (Ginsburg, J.,
dissenting).

 Indeed, allowing the
copyright owner to restrict imports irrespective of the first-sale
doctrine—i.e., reversing Quality
King—would yield a far more sensible scheme of market
segmentation than would adopting John Wiley’s argument here.
That is because only the former approach turns on the intended
market for copies; the latter rests instead on their place
of manufacture. To see the difference, imagine that John Wiley
prints all its textbooks in New York, but wants to distribute
certain versions only in Thailand. Without Quality King,
John Wiley could do so—i.e., produce books in New
York, ship them to Thailand, and prevent anyone from importing them
back into the United States. But with Quality King, that
course is not open to John Wiley even under its reading of
§109(a): To prevent someone like Kirtsaeng from re-importing
the books—and so to segment the Thai market—John Wiley
would have to move its printing facilities abroad. I can see no
reason why Congress would have conditioned a copyright
owner’s power to divide markets on outsourcing its
manufacturing to a foreign country.
