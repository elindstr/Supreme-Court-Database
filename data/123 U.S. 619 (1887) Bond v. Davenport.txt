Davenport recover of complainant the costs of this suit, so far as made, in trying the issue of the sanity of said George A. Davenport at the time of the making and delivery of said mortgage set up in complainant's original bill."

															The only parties to the suit who are before this Court are Henry R. Bond, trustee, complainant below and appellant, and Sarah G. Davenport.  These parties have filed in this Court the following stipulation:

															"In the Supreme Court of the United States"

															"Henry R. Bond, Trustee, Appellant"

															"vs."

															"Sarah G. Davenport, Appellee"

															 offered and introduced by her in said circuit court, and consents and agrees that the same shall not be considered as part of the record."

															"2. It is agreed that a decree shall be entered by the supreme court in said suit reversing the decision and decree of the said circuit court insofar as said court found in favor of said Sarah G.

Davenport, as mother and heir at law of George A. Davenport, deceased, and insofar as said court, by its said decree, undertook to dismiss complainant's bill as against said property, and tax certain costs to complainant, and that this cause be remanded to said circuit court with instructions to enter a decree in complainant's favor declaring the sums owing upon said bonds, secured by said mortgage, to be a lien upon the premises in said mortgage described, as of the date of said mortgage, and directing sale of sufficient of said premises to pay the same, and further directing that the receiver heretofore appointed in said cause shall turn over to the complainant all the funds in his hands arising from the rentals of said premises, the same to be credited upon the amount found to be owing upon said bonds secured by said mortgage before sale of said premises, and further directing that the complainant be permitted to further plead, and bring in new parties if so advised."

															"3. The complainant and appellant is excused from printing the record in this suit, save and except such portions thereof as to him shall seem material to enable the court to dispose of said suit under this stipulation."

															"4. The attorney or solicitor who has entered his appearance in this suit is authorized to consent to such demand or requirement of the complainant or the said court as shall enable the complainant to have the said decree of the circuit court reversed, said cause remanded, and a final decree entered in the circuit court in complainant's favor, and for that purpose is hereby authorized to appear in said circuit court to any pleading filed by the complainant. "

															This motion is granted, and the decree reversed, without costs, and the cause is remanded, with instructions to proceed in accordance with the foregoing stipulation of the parties to this appeal, but without prejudice to the rights of the other parties to the suit.
