															THE DUTRA GROUP, PETITIONER v. CHRISTOPHER BATTERTON

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 24, 2019]

															

															Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor join, dissenting.

															In Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker,

554 U.S. 471 (2008), the Court recognized that punitive damages normally are available in maritime cases.  Id., at 489–490, 502, 508, n. 21.  Relying on Miles v. Apex Marine Corp.,

498 U.S. 19 (1990), the Court today holds that unseaworthiness claims are an exception to that general rule.  Respondent Christopher Batterton, defending the Ninth Circuit’s decision in his favor, relies on the Court’s more recent decision in Atlantic Sounding Co. v. Townsend,

557 U.S. 404 (2009).  In my view, the Ninth Circuit correctly determined that Atlantic Sounding is the controlling precedent.  See 880 F.3d 1089, 1095–1096 (2018) (case below).  I would therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, cogently explained in Senior Circuit Judge Kleinfeld’s opinion.

															I

															Batterton was employed as a deckhand for petitioner The Dutra Group, a dredging and marine construction company.  As Batterton worked on a Dutra vessel, fellow crewmembers pumped pressurized air into a below-decks compartment.  The build up of pressurized air blew open a hatch cover that crushed Batterton’s hand, permanently disabling him.  The accident could have been prevented, Batterton alleges, by a valve to vent excess air from the compartment, something to hold the hatch cover open, or simply better warnings or supervision.

															Batterton filed a civil action asserting one claim of negligence under the Jones Act[1] and two claims under general maritime law: one for breach of the duty to provide a seaworthy vessel and one for breach of the duty to provide maintenance and cure.[2]  As to his unseaworthiness claim, Batterton sought punitive damages, alleging that Dutra’s breach was wanton and willful.

															Dutra moved to strike or dismiss Batterton’s punitive damages request.  The District Court denied the motion, 2014 WL 12538172, *2 (CD Cal. Dec. 15, 2014), and the Ninth Circuit, accepting an interlocutory appeal, affirmed, 880 F.3d 1089.  Longstanding Ninth Circuit precedent, the court observed, recognized the availability of punitive damages in seamen’s actions for unseaworthiness.  Id., at 1091 (citing Evich v. Morris, 819 F.2d 256, 258 (1987)).  Miles, 498 U. S., at 29–33, which held that loss-of-society damages are not available in survivors’ actions for unseaworthiness resulting in a seaman’s wrongful death, the court observed, did not undermine that precedent.  880 F. 3d, at 1093–1096.  “Whatever room might [have] be[en] left to support broadening Miles to cover punitive damages” sought by a seaman, the Ninth Circuit said, “was cut off by [this] Court’s decision in Atlantic Sounding,” in which this Court, recognizing that “historically, punitive damages have been available and awarded in general maritime actions,” held that such damages are available in seamen’s suits for maintenance and cure.  Id., at 1095. (quoting Atlantic Sounding, 557 U. S., at 407; alteration omitted).  Punitive damages, the Ninth Circuit concluded, are similarly available when a seaman sues for unseaworthiness under general maritime law.

															II

															I turn now to an examination of Miles and Atlantic Sounding closer than the attention accorded those decisions by the Court.

															Miles, decided in 1990, addressed this question: In a wrongful-death action premised on unseaworthiness, may a deceased seaman’s parent recover damages for loss of society?  498 U. S., at 21.  As the Court explained in Miles, historically, general maritime law did not recognize a cause of action for wrongful death.  Id., at 23 (citing The Harrisburg,

119 U.S. 199 (1886)).  But since the late 19th century, every State had adopted a statutory wrongful-death cause of action.  Miles, 498 U. S., at 23.  And in two statutes, Congress had provided for wrongful-death recoveries in maritime cases.  Ibid.  First, the Jones Act,

46 U. S. C. §30104, provided a right of action for the survivor of a seaman killed in the course of his employment.  Second, the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA),

46 U. S. C. §30301 et seq., provided a right of action for the survivor of anyone killed “by wrongful act, neglect, or default . . . on the high seas.”  §30302; Miles, 498 U. S., at 24.  But the Jones Act and DOHSA left some wrongful deaths at sea without a remedy.  See Miles, 498 U. S., at 25–26.[3]  To fill gaps in this statutory regime, and in light of legislative abrogation of the common-law disallowance of wrongful-death claims, the Court in Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc.,

398 U.S. 375, 409 (1970), recognized a general maritime cause of action for the wrongful death of a longshoreman.  See also Miles, 498 U. S., at 26–30 (claim for wrongful death is also available to seamen’s survivors).

															After recounting this history, the Miles Court addressed the damages relief available for maritime wrongful death.  Because “Congress and the States ha[d] legislated extensively in” the field of maritime law, the Court stated, “admiralty court[s] should look primarily to these legislative enactments for policy guidance.”  Id., at 27.  Congress had expressly limited damages recoverable under DOHSA to “pecuniary loss” sustained by the decedent’s survivor.  Id., at 31 (citing 46 U. S. C. App. §762, recodified at §30303).  And the Jones Act adopted the substantive provisions of the Federal Employers Liability Act,

45 U. S. C. §51 et seq., which the Court construed to confine wrongful-death damages to “pecuniary loss.”  Miles, 498 U. S., at 32.  The Miles Court reasoned that loss-of-society damages were nonpecuniary, that such damages could not be recovered under DOHSA or the Jones Act, and that it would “be inconsistent with [the Court’s] place in the constitutional scheme . . . to sanction more expansive remedies” under general maritime law.  Miles, 498 U. S., at 31–33.[4]

															Some 19 years after Miles, in Atlantic Sounding, this Court held that punitive damages are available in actions for maintenance and cure under general maritime law.  557 U. S., at 408.  Atlantic Sounding’s reasoning had four components.  First, the Court observed, punitive damages had a long common-law pedigree.  Id., at 409–410.  Second, the “general rule that punitive damages were avail- able at common law extended to claims arising under federal maritime law.”  Id., at 411; see id., at 411–412.  Third, “[n]othing in maritime law undermine[d] the applicability of this general rule in the maintenance and cure context,” notwithstanding slim evidence that punitive damages were historically awarded in maintenance and cure actions.  Id., at 412; see id., at 412–415, and n. 4.  Finally, neither the Jones Act nor any other statute indicated that Congress sought to displace the presumption that remedies generally available under the common law are avail- able for maritime claims.  While the Jones Act armed seamen with a statutory action for negligence attributable to a vessel operator, that remedy, Atlantic Sounding noted, did not curtail pre-existing maritime causes of action and remedies.  Id., at 415–418.  The Atlantic Sounding Court rejected as “far too broad” the argument that the remedies available under general maritime law were confined to those available under the Jones Act or DOHSA.  Id., at 418–419.

															The Atlantic Sounding inquiries control this case.  As in Atlantic Sounding, “both the general maritime cause of action”—here, unseaworthiness—“and the remedy (punitive damages) were well established before the passage of the Jones Act.”  557 U. S., at 420; Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc.,

362 U.S. 539, 544 (1960); The Osceola,

189 U.S. 158, 175 (1903).  And, unlike the maritime wrongful-death action at issue in Miles, Batterton’s claim of unseaworthiness resulting in personal injury was not created to fill gaps in a statutory scheme.  See Atlantic Sounding, 557 U. S., at 420; Miles, 498 U. S., at 27, 36.  The damages available for Batterton’s unseaworthiness claim, Atlantic Sounding therefore signals, need not track those available under the Jones Act.  See 557 U. S., at 424, n. 12.

															III

															Applying Atlantic Sounding’s test, see supra, at 5, punitive damages are not categorically barred in unseaworthiness actions.  Atlantic Sounding itself answers the first two inquiries.  See supra, at 5.  “Punitive damages have long been an available remedy at common law for wanton, willful, or outrageous conduct.”  557 U. S., at 409; see id., at 409–410.  And “[t]he general rule that punitive damages [are] available at common law extended to claims arising under federal maritime law.”  Id., at 411; see id., at 411–412.  As next explained, the third and fourth components of Atlantic Sounding’s test are also satisfied.

															A

															Atlantic Sounding asks, third, whether anything in maritime law “undermines the applicability [to the maritime action at issue] of th[e] general rule” that punitive damages are available under general maritime law.  Id., at 412.  True, there is no evidence that courts awarded punitive damages for unseaworthiness before the mid-20th century.  See ante, at 11–13.  But neither is there evidence that punitive damages were unavailable in unseaworthiness actions.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.

															Contrary to the Court’s assertion, evidence of the availability of punitive damages for maintenance and cure was not “central to our decision in Atlantic Sounding.”  Ante, at 14–15.  Far from it.  “[A] search for cases in which punitive damages were awarded for the willful denial of maintenance and cure . . . yields very little.”  Atlantic Sounding, 557 U. S., at 430 (Alito, J., dissenting).  The Court in Atlantic Sounding invoked historical evidence about punitive damages in maintenance and cure actions, “strikingly slim” though it was, id., at 431, only to underscore this point: Without a showing that punitive damages were unavailable, the generally applicable common-law rule allowing punitive damages should not be displaced.  See id., at 412–415 (majority opinion).  Here, too, the absence of evidence that punitive damages were unavail- able in unseaworthiness cases supports adherence to the general common-law rule permitting punitive damages.

															B

															Atlantic Sounding asks fourth: Has Congress “enacted legislation departing from th[e] common-law understanding” that punitive damages are generally available?  See id., at 415.  Dutra contends that unseaworthiness claims and claims under the Jones Act are “simply two paths to compensation for the same injury.”  Brief for Petitioner 19–20 (emphasis deleted).  Positing that punitive damages are unavailable under the Jones Act,[5] Dutra concludes they are likewise unavailable in unseaworthiness suits.  Id., at 17.  See also ante, at 13–15.  Dutra’s argument is unavailing, for the Jones Act does not preclude the award of punitive damages in unseaworthiness cases.

															As noted, the Jones Act provides a cause of action for a seaman injured by his or her employer’s negligence.

46 U. S. C. §30104.  Congress passed the Act “primarily to overrule The Osceola, [

189 U.S. 158,] in which this Court prohibited a seaman or his family from recovering for injuries or death suffered due to his employers’ negligence.”  Atlantic Sounding, 557 U. S., at 415.  The Jones Act was intended to “enlarge th[e] protection” afforded to seamen, “not to narrow it.”  The Arizona v. Anelich,

298 U.S. 110, 123 (1936).  Accordingly, the Jones Act did not provide an “exclusive remedy” for seamen’s injuries; instead, it “preserve[d]” and supplemented “common-law causes of action.”  Atlantic Sounding, 557 U. S., at 416–417.  As Miles itself recognized, the Jones Act “d[id] not disturb seamen’s general maritime claims for injuries resulting from unseaworthiness.”  498 U. S., at 29.

															When the Jones Act was enacted, unseaworthiness and negligence were “discrete concepts”: Unseaworthiness related “to the structure of the ship and the adequacy of [its] equipment and furnishings,” while negligence concerned “the direction and control of operations aboard ship.”  G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty §6–3, p. 277 (2d ed. 1975).  Because these actions were distinct, it is improbable that, by enacting the Jones Act, Congress meant to limit the remedies available in unseaworthiness cases.  Though unseaworthiness and Jones Act negligence now “significant[ly] overlap,” ante, at 8, that overlap resulted primarily from mid-20th-century judicial decisions expanding the scope of unseaworthiness liability.  See Mitchell, 362 U. S., at 547–550.[6]  Those decisions do not so much as hint that Congress, in enacting the Jones Act, intended to cabin the relief available for unseaworthiness.  Even today, unseaworthiness and Jones Act negligence are “not identical.”  2 R. Force & M. Norris, The Law of Seamen §27:25, p. 27–61 (5th ed. 2003).[7]  The persistent differences between unseaworthiness and Jones Act claims weigh against inserting into general maritime law damages limitations that may be applicable to Jones Act suits.  See supra, at 7, n. 5.[8]

															The Court observes that a plaintiff may not recover twice for the same injury under the Jones Act and unseaworthiness.  Ante, at 9.  True enough.  But the Court does not explain why a bar to double recovery of compensatory damages should affect the availability of a single award of punitive damages.  Notably, punitive damages are not awarded to compensate the plaintiff; their office is to punish the defendant and deter misconduct.  See Exxon, 554 U. S., at 492; W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts §2, p. 9 (5th ed. 1984).  There is thus no tension between preventing double recovery of compensatory damages and allowing the recovery, once, of punitive damages.

															IV

															Finally, the Court takes up policy arguments against the availability of punitive damages in unseaworthiness actions.  Ante, at 15–18.  The Court, however, has long recognized the general availability of punitive damages under maritime law.  E.g., Atlantic Sounding, 557 U. S., at 411–412; Exxon, 554 U. S., at 489–490; The Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat. 546, 558 (1818).

															Punitive damages serve to deter and punish “lawless misconduct.”  Ibid.  The imperative of countering a “heightened threat of harm,” Exxon, 554 U. S., at 490, is especially pressing with regard to sailors, who face unique “hazards in the ship’s service,” Harden v. Gordon, 11 F. Cas. 480, 483 (No. 6,047) (CC Me. 1823) (Story, J.).  These dangers, more than paternalistic 19th-century attitudes towards sailors, see ante, at 18, account for the Court’s “ ‘special solicitude’ ” for “those who undertake to ‘venture upon hazardous and unpredictable sea voyages.’ ”  Air & Liquid Systems Corp. v. DeVries, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 9) (quoting American Export Lines, Inc. v. Alvez,

446 U.S. 274, 285 (1980)).

															Dutra and the Court warn that allowing punitive damages in unseaworthiness actions could impair maritime commerce.  Brief for Petitioner 33–34; ante, at 17–18.  But punitive damages have been available in maintenance and cure cases in all Circuits for the last decade, Atlantic Sounding,

557 U.S. 404, and in unseaworthiness cases in some Circuits for longer, see Self v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 832 F.2d 1540, 1550 (CA11 1987); Evich, 819 F. 2d, at 258.  No tidal wave has overwhelmed commerce in those Circuits.

															Permitting punitive damages for unseaworthiness, the Court further urges, would create “bizarre disparities.”  Ante, at 17.  I see no “bizarre disparit[y]” in allowing an injured sailor to seek remedies unavailable to survivors of deceased seamen.  See Keeton, supra, §127, at 949, 951 (state wrongful-death statutes frequently limit survivors’ recoveries to pecuniary damages).  Nor is it “bizarre” to permit recovery of punitive damages against a shipowner “for injuries due to unseaworthiness of the vessel.”  The Arizona, 298 U. S., at 120.  Exposure to such damages helps to deter wrongdoing, particularly when malfeasance is “hard to detect.”  Exxon, 554 U. S., at 494.  If there is any “bizarre disparit[y],” it is the one the Court today creates: Punitive damages are available for willful and wanton breach of the duty to provide maintenance and cure, but not for similarly culpable breaches of the duty to provide a seaworthy vessel.

															*  *  *

															For the reasons stated, I would affirm the Court of Appeals’ judgment.
Notes
1
 The Jones Act provides: “A seaman injured in the course of employment or, if the seaman dies from the injury, the personal representative of the seaman[,] may elect to bring a civil action at law, with the right of trial by jury, against the employer.  Laws of the United States regulating recovery for personal injury to, or death of, a railway employee apply to an action under this section.”

46 U. S. C. §30104. 

2
 “Maintenance and cure” is the right of “the seaman, ill or injured in the service of the ship without willful misbehavior on his part[ to] wages to the end of the voyage and subsistence, lodging, and medical care to the point where the maximum cure attainable has been reached.”  2 R. Force & M. Norris, The Law of Seamen §26:1, p. 26–4 (5th ed. 2003). 

3
 These were the unprovided-for cases: “First, in territorial waters, general maritime law allowed a remedy for unseaworthiness resulting in injury, but not for death.  Second, DOHSA allowed a remedy for death resulting from unseaworthiness on the high seas, but general maritime law did not allow such recovery for a similar death in territorial waters.  Finally, . . . in those States whose statutes allowed a claim for wrongful death resulting from unseaworthiness, recovery was available for the death of a longshoreman due to unseaworthiness, but not for the death of a Jones Act seaman.  This was because wrongful death actions under the Jones Act are limited to negligence, and the Jones Act pre-empts state law remedies for the death or injury of a seaman.”  Miles v. Apex Marine Corp.,

498 U.S. 19, 26 (1990) (citation omitted). 

4
 The Miles Court relied on comparable reasoning in denying the deceased seaman’s estate, which had brought a survival action, the right to recover future earnings.  See id., at 33–37.  Under “the traditional maritime rule,” “there [wa]s no survival of unseaworthiness claims.”  Id., at 34.  The Court declined to decide whether to recognize a general maritime survival right, however, because, even if such a right were recognized, it would not support recovery of lost future income.  Ibid.  This damages limitation followed from the Jones Act, DOHSA, and most States’ laws, which did not permit recovery of such damages.  See id., at 35–36. 

5
 This Court has not decided whether punitive damages are available under the Jones Act.  See Atlantic Sounding Co. v. Townsend,

557 U.S. 404, 424, n. 12 (2009) (reserving the question). 

6
 In particular, this Court held that a shipowner’s duty to provide a seaworthy vessel was “absolute,” thereby rendering unseaworthiness a strict-liability tort.  Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki,

328 U.S. 85, 94–95 (1946); Mahnich v. Southern S. S. Co.,

321 U.S. 96, 100–101 (1944); see 1B Benedict on Admiralty §23, pp. 3–12 to 3–16 (7th rev. ed. 2018).  In addition, courts broadened the range of conditions that could render a vessel unseaworthy.  Id., §23, at 3–16 to 3–19. 

7
 Unseaworthiness is a strict-liability tort, ante, at 7–8; the Jones Act requires proof of negligence, Lewis v. Lewis & Clark Marine, Inc.,

531 U.S. 438, 441 (2001).  Unseaworthiness claims run against the vessel’s owner, Mahnich, 321 U. S., at 100; Jones Act claims are brought against the seaman’s “employer,” §30104.  Injury caused by the negligent act or omission of a fit fellow crewmember may be actionable under the Jones Act but is not ground for an unseaworthiness suit.  1B Benedict on Admiralty §23, at 3–34 to 3–38; see Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp.,

400 U.S. 494 (1971).  And a vessel owner is liable for unseaworthiness only when the unseaworthy condition proximately caused the plaintiff ’s injury; under the Jones Act, a plaintiff can prevail upon showing the “slight[est]” causal connection between the defendant’s conduct and the plaintiff ’s injury.  2 Force & Norris, The Law of Seamen §27:25, at 27–62 to 27–63.  See also id., §27:2, at 27–7, and n. 6 (the duty to provide a seaworthy vessel may run to “seamen” who do not qualify as such under the Jones Act). 

8
 The Court recognizes “that the general maritime law need not be static,” but would confine changes in that law to those needed to align it with statutory law.  Ante, at 16, n. 9.  As just stated, however, supra, at 8–9, the Jones Act was intended to augment, not to cabin, relief avail-able to seamen.
