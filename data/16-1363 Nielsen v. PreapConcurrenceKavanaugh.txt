															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															I write separately to emphasize the narrowness of the issue before us and, in particular, to emphasize what this case is not about.

															This case is not about whether a noncitizen may be removed from the United States on the basis of criminal offenses.  Under longstanding federal statutes, the Executive Branch may remove noncitizens from the United States when the noncitizens have been convicted of certain crimes, even when the crimes were committed many years ago.

															This case is also not about whether a noncitizen may be detained during removal proceedings or before removal.  Congress has expressly authorized the Executive Branch to detain noncitizens during their removal proceedings and before removal.  8 U. S. C. §§1226(a), (c), and 1231(a).

															This case is also not about how long a noncitizen may be detained during removal proceedings or before removal.  We have addressed that question in cases such as Zadvydas v. Davis,

533 U.S. 678 (2001), Clark v. Martinez,

543 U.S. 371 (2005), and Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___ (2018).

															This case is also not about whether Congress may mandate that the Executive Branch detain noncitizens during removal proceedings or before removal, as opposed to merely giving the Executive Branch discretion to detain.  It is undisputed that Congress may mandate that the Executive Branch detain certain noncitizens during removal proceedings or before removal.  Congress has in fact mandated detention of certain noncitizens who have been in criminal custody and who, upon their release, would pose a danger to the community or risk of flight.  As relevant here, Congress has mandated detention “when” such noncitizens are “released” from criminal custody. 

8 U. S. C. §1226(c)(1).

															The sole question before us is narrow: whether, under §1226, the Executive Branch’s mandatory duty to detain a particular noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody remains mandatory if the Executive Branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen when the noncitizen is released from criminal custody—for example, if the Executive Branch fails to immediately detain the noncitizen because of resource constraints or because the Executive Branch cannot immediately locate and apprehend the individual in question.  No constitutional issue is presented.  The issue before us is entirely statutory and requires our interpretation of the strict 1996 illegal-immigration law passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton.  Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996,

110Stat.
3009–546.  

															It would be odd, in my view, if the Act (1) mandated detention of particular noncitizens because the noncitizens posed such a serious risk of danger or flight that they must be detained during their removal proceedings, but (2) nonetheless allowed the noncitizens to remain free during their removal proceedings if the Executive Branch failed to immediately detain them upon their release from criminal custody.  Not surprisingly, the Act does not require such an odd result.  On the contrary, the relevant text of the Act is relatively straightforward, as the Court explains.  Interpreting that text, the Court correctly holds that the Executive Branch’s detention of the particular noncitizens here remained mandatory even though the Executive Branch did not immediately detain them.  I agree with the Court’s careful statutory analysis, and I join the Court’s opinion in full.
