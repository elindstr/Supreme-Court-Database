															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–857

															_________________

															MARCUS DEANGELO JONES, PETITIONER v.
DEWAYNE HENDRIX, WARDEN

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[June 22, 2023]

															

															Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan,
dissenting.

															We respectfully dissent. As Justice Jackson
explains, today’s decision yields disturbing results. See
post, at 23–25 (dissenting opinion). A prisoner who is
actually innocent, imprisoned for conduct that Congress did not
criminalize, is forever barred by 28 U. S. C.
§2255(h) from raising that claim, merely because he previously
sought postconviction relief. It does not matter that an
intervening decision of this Court confirms his innocence. By
challenging his conviction once before, he forfeited his
freedom.

															Though we agree with Justice Jackson that this
is not the scheme Congress designed, we see the matter as the
Solicitor General does. As all agree, Congress enacted §2255
to “afford federal prisoners a remedy identical in scope to
federal habeas corpus.” Davis v. United States,
417 U.S.
333, 343 (1974). To ensure that equivalence, Congress built in
a saving clause, allowing recourse to habeas when the “remedy
by motion” under §2255 is “inadequate or
ineffective” compared to the remedy it replaced: an
“application for a writ of habeas corpus.”
§2255(e). So, as this Court has explained, if §2255 bars
a claim cognizable at habeas, such that the remedies are not
“commensurate,” the saving clause kicks in, and the
prisoner may “proceed in federal habeas corpus.”
Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S.
1, 14–15 (1963); see United States v.
Hayman, 342 U.S.
205, 223 (1952).

															With that understanding in mind, consider a
prisoner who, having already filed a motion for postconviction
relief, discovers that a new decision of this Court establishes
that his statute of conviction did not cover his conduct. He is out
of luck under §2255, because §2255(h) will bar his claim.
But that claim is cognizable at habeas, where we have long held
that federal prisoners can collaterally attack their convictions in
successive petitions if they can make a colorable showing that they
are innocent under an intervening decision of statutory
construction. See Davis, 417 U. S., at 344–347;
McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S.
467, 493–495 (1991). Congress did not abrogate that
principle in §2255(h). Thus, we have precisely the kind of
mismatch the saving clause was designed to address.

															In this case, the petitioner says he is that
prisoner, with that mismatch. But the Court of Appeals never
considered that question, laboring under a mistaken view of the
saving clause that, like the majority’s, assigns it almost no
role. Accordingly, we would remand for the lower courts to consider
the petitioner’s claim under the proper framework. See
Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S.
709, 718, n. 7 (2005).
