															MICHAEL SACKETT, et ux., PETITIONERS v.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 25, 2023]

															

															Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															This case concerns a nagging question about the
outer reaches of the Clean Water Act (CWA), the principal federal
law regulating water pollution in the United States.[1] By all accounts, the Act has been a great
success. Before its enactment in 1972, many of the Nation’s
rivers, lakes, and streams were severely polluted, and existing
federal legislation had proved to be inadequate. Today, many
formerly fetid bodies of water are safe for the use and enjoyment
of the people of this country.

															There is, however, an unfortunate footnote to
this success story: the outer boundaries of the Act’s
geographical reach have been uncertain from the start. The Act
applies to “the waters of the United States,” but what
does that phrase mean? Does the term encompass any backyard that is
soggy enough for some minimum period of time? Does it reach
“mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes,
wet meadows, [or] playa lakes?”[2] How about ditches, swimming pools, and puddles?

															For more than a half century, the agencies
responsible for enforcing the Act have wrestled with the problem
and adopted varying interpretations. On three prior occasions, this
Court has tried to clarify the meaning of “the waters of the
United States.” But the problem persists. When we last
addressed the question 17 years ago, we were unable to agree on an
opinion of the Court.[3] Today,
we return to the problem and attempt to identify with greater
clarity what the Act means by “the waters of the United
States.”

															I

															A

															For most of this Nation’s history, the
regulation of water pollution was left almost entirely to the
States and their subdivisions. The common law permitted aggrieved
parties to bring nuisance suits against polluters. But as
industrial production and population growth increased the quantity
and toxicity of pollution, States gradually shifted to enforcement
by regulatory agencies.[4]
Conversely, federal regulation was largely limited to ensuring that
“traditional navigable waters”—that is,
interstate waters that were either navigable in fact and used in
commerce or readily susceptible of being used in this
way—remained free of impediments. See, e.g., Rivers
and Harbors Act of 1899, 30Stat. 1151; see also United
States v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 311 U.S.
377, 406–407 (1940); The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall.
557, 563 (1871).

															Congress’s early efforts at directly
regulating water pollution were tepid. Although the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act of 1948 allowed federal officials to seek
judicial abatement of pollution in interstate waters, it imposed
high hurdles, such as requiring the consent of the State where the
pollution originated. See 62Stat. 1156–1157. Despite repeated
amendments over the next two decades, few actions were brought
under this framework.[5]

															Congress eventually replaced this scheme in 1972
with the CWA. See 86Stat. 816. The Act prohibits “the
discharge of any pollutant” into “navigable
waters.” 33 U. S. C. §§1311(a),
1362(12)(A). It broadly defines the term
“ ‘pollutant’ ” to include not
only contaminants like “chemical wastes,” but also more
mundane materials like “rock, sand,” and “cellar
dirt.” §1362(6).

															The CWA is a potent weapon. It imposes what have
been described as “crushing” consequences “even
for inadvertent violations.” Army Corps of Engineers
v. Hawkes Co., 578 U.S. 590, 602 (2016) (Kennedy, J.,
concurring). Property owners who negligently discharge
“pollutants” into covered waters may face severe
criminal penalties including imprisonment. §1319(c). These
penalties increase for knowing violations. Ibid. On the
civil side, the CWA imposes over $60,000 in fines per day for each
violation. See Note following 28 U. S. C. §2461; 33
U. S. C. §1319(d); 88 Fed. Reg. 989 (2023) (to be
codified in 40 CFR §19.4). And due to the Act’s 5-year
statute of limitations, 28 U. S. C. §2462, and
expansive interpretations of the term “violation,”
these civil penalties can be nearly as crushing as their criminal
counterparts, see, e.g., Borden Ranch Partnership v.
United States Army Corps of Engineers, 
261 F.3d 810, 813, 818 (CA9 2001) (upholding Agency decision to
count each of 348 passes of a plow by a farmer through
“jurisdictional” soil on his farm as a separate
violation), aff ’d by an equally divided Court,
537 U.S.
99 (2002) (per curiam).

															The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) jointly enforce the CWA. The
EPA is tasked with policing violations after the fact, either by
issuing orders demanding compliance or by bringing civil actions.
§1319(a). The Act also authorizes private plaintiffs to sue to
enforce its requirements. §1365(a). On the front end, both
agencies are empowered to issue permits exempting activity that
would otherwise be unlawful under the Act. Relevant here, the Corps
controls permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into
covered waters. See §1344(a). The costs of obtaining such a
permit are “significant,” and both agencies have
admitted that “the permitting process can be arduous,
expensive, and long.” Hawkes Co., 578 U. S., at
594–595, 601. Success is also far from guaranteed, as the
Corps has asserted discretion to grant or deny permits based on a
long, nonexclusive list of factors that ends with a catchall
mandate to consider “in general, the needs and welfare of the
people.” 33 CFR §320.4(a)(1) (2022).

															Due to the CWA’s capacious definition of
“pollutant,” its low mens rea, and its severe
penalties, regulated parties have focused particular attention on
the Act’s geographic scope. While its predecessor encompassed
“interstate or navigable waters,” 33 U. S. C.
§1160(a) (1970 ed.), the CWA prohibits the discharge of
pollutants into only “navigable waters,” which it
defines as “the waters of the United States, including the
territorial seas,” 33 U. S. C. §§1311(a),
1362(7), (12)(A) (2018 ed.). The meaning of this definition is the
persistent problem that we must address.

															B

															Michael and Chantell Sackett have spent well
over a decade navigating the CWA, and their voyage has been bumpy
and costly. In 2004, they purchased a small lot near Priest Lake,
in Bonner County, Idaho. In preparation for building a modest home,
they began backfilling their property with dirt and rocks. A few
months later, the EPA sent the Sacketts a compliance order
informing them that their backfilling violated the CWA because
their property contained protected wetlands. The EPA demanded that
the Sacketts immediately “ ‘undertake activities
to restore the Site’ ” pursuant to a
“ ‘Restoration Work Plan’ ” that
it provided. Sackett v. EPA, 566
U.S. 120, 125 (2012). The order threatened the Sacketts with
penalties of over $40,000 per day if they did not comply.

															At the time, the EPA interpreted “the
waters of the United States” to include “[a]ll
. . . waters” that “could affect interstate
or foreign commerce,” as well as “[w]etlands
adjacent” to those waters. 40 CFR §§230.3(s)(3),
(7) (2008). “[A]djacent” was defined to mean not just
“bordering” or “contiguous,” but also
“neighboring.” §230.3(b). Agency guidance
instructed officials to assert jurisdiction over wetlands
“adjacent” to non-navigable tributaries when those
wetlands had “a significant nexus to a traditional navigable
water.”[6] A
“significant nexus” was said to exist when
“ ‘wetlands, either alone or in combination with
similarly situated lands in the region, significantly
affect the chemical, physical, and biological
integrity’ ” of those waters. 2007 Guidance 8
(emphasis added). In looking for evidence of a “significant
nexus,” field agents were told to consider a wide range of
open-ended hydrological and ecological factors. See id., at
7.

															According to the EPA, the “wetlands”
on the Sacketts’ lot are “adjacent to” (in the
sense that they are in the same neighborhood as) what it described
as an “unnamed tributary” on the other side of a
30-foot road. App. 33. That tributary feeds into a non-navigable
creek, which, in turn, feeds into Priest Lake, an intrastate body
of water that the EPA designated as traditionally navigable. To
establish a significant nexus, the EPA lumped the Sacketts’
lot together with the Kalispell Bay Fen, a large nearby wetland
complex that the Agency regarded as “similarly
situated.” According to the EPA, these properties, taken
together, “significantly affect” the ecology of Priest
Lake. Therefore, the EPA concluded, the Sacketts had illegally
dumped soil and gravel onto “the waters of the United
States.”

															The Sacketts filed suit under the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. §702 et seq.,
alleging that the EPA lacked jurisdiction because any wetlands on
their property were not “waters of the United States.”
The District Court initially dismissed the suit, reasoning that the
compliance order was not a final agency action, but this Court
ultimately held that the Sacketts could bring their suit under the
APA. See Sackett, 566 U. S., at 131. After seven years
of additional proceedings on remand, the District Court entered
summary judgment for the EPA. 2019 WL 13026870 (D Idaho, Mar. 31,
2019). The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the CWA covers
adjacent wetlands with a significant nexus to traditional navigable
waters and that the Sacketts’ lot satisfied that standard. 8
F. 4th 1075, 1091–1093 (2021).

															We granted certiorari to decide the proper test
for determining whether wetlands are “waters of the United
States.” 595 U. S. ___ (2022).

															II

															A

															In defining the meaning of “the waters
of the United States,” we revisit what has been “a
contentious and difficult task.” National Assn. of
Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 U. S. ___, ___
(2018) (slip op., at 1). The phrase has sparked decades of agency
action and litigation. In order to resolve the CWA’s
applicability to wetlands, we begin by reviewing this history.

															The EPA and the Corps initially promulgated
different interpretations of “the waters of the United
States.” The EPA defined its jurisdiction broadly to include,
for example, intrastate lakes used by interstate travelers. 38 Fed.
Reg. 13529 (1973). Conversely, the Corps, consistent with its
historical authority to regulate obstructions to navigation,
asserted jurisdiction over only traditional navigable waters. 39
Fed. Reg. 12119 (1974). But the Corps’ narrow definition did
not last. It soon promulgated new, much broader definitions
designed to reach the outer limits of Congress’s commerce
power. See 42 Fed. Reg. 37144, and n. 2 (1977); 40 Fed. Reg.
31324–31325 (1975).

															Eventually the EPA and Corps settled on
materially identical definitions. See 45 Fed. Reg. 33424 (1980); 47
Fed. Reg. 31810–31811 (1982). These broad definitions
encompassed “[a]ll . . . waters” that
“could affect interstate or foreign commerce.” 40 CFR
§230.3(s)(3) (2008). So long as the potential for an
interstate effect was present, the regulation extended the CWA to,
for example, “intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including
intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs,
prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural
ponds.” Ibid. The agencies likewise took an expansive
view of the CWA’s coverage of wetlands “adjacent”
to covered waters. §230.3(s)(7). As noted, they defined
“adjacent” to mean “bordering, contiguous, or
neighboring” and clarified that “adjacent”
wetlands include those that are separated from covered waters
“by man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach
dunes and the like.” §230.3(b). They also specified that
“wetlands” is a technical term encompassing
“those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or
ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and
that under normal conditions do support, a prevalence of vegetation
typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.”
§230.3(t). The Corps released what would become a 143-page
manual to guide officers when they determine whether property meets
this definition.[7]

															This Court first construed the meaning of
“the waters of the United States” in United
States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc.,
474 U.S.
121 (1985). There, we were confronted with the Corps’
assertion of authority under the CWA over wetlands that
“actually abut[ted] on a navigable waterway.”
Id., at 135. Although we expressed concern that wetlands
seemed to fall outside “traditional notions of
‘waters,’ ” we nonetheless deferred to the
Corps, reasoning that “the transition from water to solid
ground is not necessarily or even typically an abrupt one.”
Id., at 132–133.

															The agencies responded to Riverside
Bayview by expanding their interpretations even further. Most
notably, they issued the “migratory bird rule,” which
extended jurisdiction to any waters or wetlands that “are or
would be used as [a] habitat” by migratory birds or
endangered species. See 53 Fed. Reg. 20765 (1988); 51 Fed. Reg.
41217 (1986). As the Corps would later admit, “nearly all
waters were jurisdictional under the migratory bird
rule.”[8]

															In Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook
Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531
U.S. 159 (2001) (SWANCC), this Court rejected the
migratory bird rule, which the Corps had used to assert
jurisdiction over several isolated ponds located wholly within the
State of Illinois. Disagreeing with the Corps’ argument that
ecological interests supported its jurisdiction, we instead held
that the CWA does not “exten[d] to ponds that are not
adjacent to open water.” Id., at 168 (emphasis
deleted).

															Days after our decision, the agencies issued
guidance that sought to minimize SWANCC’s impact. They
took the view that this Court’s holding was “strictly
limited to waters that are ‘nonnavigable, isolated, and
intrastate’ ” and that “field staff should
continue to exercise CWA jurisdiction to the full extent of their
authority” for “any waters that fall outside of that
category.”[9] The
agencies never defined exactly what they regarded as the
“full extent of their authority.” They instead
encouraged local field agents to make decisions on a case-by-case
basis.

															What emerged was a system of “vague”
rules that depended on “locally developed practices.”
GAO Report 26. Deferring to the agencies’ localized
decisions, lower courts blessed an array of expansive
interpretations of the CWA’s reach. See, e.g.,
United States v. Deaton, 
332 F.3d 698, 702 (CA4 2003) (holding that a property owner
violated the CWA by piling soil near a ditch 32 miles from
navigable waters). Within a few years, the agencies had
“interpreted their jurisdiction over ‘the waters of the
United States’ to cover 270-to-300 million acres” of
wetlands and “virtually any parcel of land containing a
channel or conduit . . . through which rainwater or
drainage may occasionally or intermittently flow.”
Rapanos v. United States, 547
U.S. 715, 722 (2006) (plurality opinion).

															It was against this backdrop that we granted
review in Rapanos v. United States. The lower court
in the principal case before us had held that the CWA covered
wetlands near ditches and drains that eventually emptied into
navigable waters at least 11 miles away, a theory that had
supported the petitioner’s conviction in a related
prosecution. Id., at 720, 729. Although we vacated that
decision, no position commanded a majority of the Court. Four
Justices concluded that the CWA’s coverage did not extend
beyond two categories: first, certain relatively permanent bodies
of water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters and,
second, wetlands with such a close physical connection to those
waters that they were “as a practical matter
indistinguishable from waters of the United States.”
Id., at 742, 755 (emphasis deleted). Four Justices would
have deferred to the Government’s determination that the
wetlands at issue were covered under the CWA. Id., at 788
(Stevens, J., dissenting). Finally, one Justice concluded that
jurisdiction under the CWA requires a “significant
nexus” between wetlands and navigable waters and that such a
nexus exists where “the wetlands, either alone or in
combination with similarly situated lands in the region,
significantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological
integrity” of those waters. Id., at 779–780
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).

															In the decade following Rapanos, the EPA
and the Corps issued guidance documents that “recognized
larger grey areas and called for more fact-intensive individualized
determinations in those grey areas.”[10] As discussed, they instructed agency
officials to assert jurisdiction over wetlands
“adjacent” to non-navigable tributaries based on
fact-specific determinations regarding the presence of a
significant nexus. 2008 Guidance 8. The guidance further advised
officials to make this determination by considering a lengthy list
of hydrological and ecological factors. Ibid. Echoing what
they had said about the migratory bird rule, the agencies later
admitted that “almost all waters and wetlands across the
country theoretically could be subject to a case-specific
jurisdictional determination” under this guidance. 80 Fed.
Reg. 37056 (2015); see, e.g., Hawkes Co., 578
U. S., at 596 (explaining that the Corps found a significant
nexus between wetlands and a river “some 120 miles
away”).

															More recently, the agencies have engaged in a
flurry of rulemaking defining “the waters of the United
States.” In a 2015 rule, they offered a muscular approach
that would subject “the vast majority of the nation’s
water features” to a case-by-case jurisdictional
analysis.[11] Although the
rule listed a few examples of “waters” that were
excluded from regulation like “[p]uddles” and
“swimming pools,” it categorically covered other waters
and wetlands, including any within 1,500 feet of interstate or
traditional navigable waters. 80 Fed. Reg. 37116–37117. And
it subjected a wider range of other waters, including any within
4,000 feet of indirect tributaries of interstate or traditional
navigable waters, to a case-specific determination for significant
nexus. Ibid.

															The agencies repealed this sweeping rule in
2019. 84 Fed. Reg. 56626. Shortly afterwards, they replaced it with
a narrower definition that limited jurisdiction to traditional
navigable waters and their tributaries, lakes, and
“adjacent” wetlands. 85 Fed. Reg. 22340 (2020). They
also narrowed the definition of “[a]djacent,” limiting
it to wetlands that “[a]but” covered waters, are
flooded by those waters, or are separated from those waters by
features like berms or barriers. Ibid. This rule too did not
last. After granting the EPA’s voluntary motion to remand, a
District Court vacated the rule. See Pascua Yaqui Tribe v.
EPA, 557 F. Supp. 3d 949, 957 (D Ariz. 2021).

															The agencies recently promulgated yet another
rule attempting to define waters of the United States. 88 Fed. Reg.
3004 (2023) (to be codified in 40 CFR §120.2). Under that
broader rule, traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, and
the territorial seas, as well as their tributaries and adjacent
wetlands, are waters of the United States. 88 Fed. Reg. 3143. So
are any “[i]ntrastate lakes and ponds, streams, or
wetlands” that either have a continuous surface connection to
categorically included waters or have a significant nexus to
interstate or traditional navigable waters. Id., at 3006,
3143. Like the post-Rapanos guidance, the rule states that a
significant nexus requires consideration of a list of open-ended
factors. 88 Fed. Reg. 3006, 3144. Finally, the rule returns to the
broad pre-2020 definition of “adjacent.” Ibid.;
see supra, at 7. Acknowledging that “[f ]ield
work is often necessary to confirm the presence of a wetland”
under these definitions, the rule instructs local agents to
continue using the Corps’ Wetlands Delineation Manual. 88
Fed. Reg. 3117.

															B

															With the benefit of a half century of practice
under the CWA, it is worth taking stock of where things stand. The
agencies maintain that the significant-nexus test has been and
remains sufficient to establish jurisdiction over
“adjacent” wetlands. And by the EPA’s own
admission, “almost all waters and wetlands” are
potentially susceptible to regulation under that test. 80 Fed. Reg.
37056. This puts many property owners in a precarious position
because it is “often difficult to determine whether a
particular piece of property contains waters of the United
States.” Hawkes Co., 578 U. S., at 594; see 40
CFR §230.3(t) (2008). Even if a property appears dry,
application of the guidance in a complicated manual ultimately
decides whether it contains wetlands. See 88 Fed. Reg. 3117;
Wetlands Delineation Manual 84–85 (describing “not
. . . atypical” examples of wetlands that
periodically lack wetlands indicators); see also Hawkes Co.
v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 782 F.3d 994, 1003
(CA8 2015) (Kelly, J., concurring) (“This is a unique aspect
of the CWA; most laws do not require the hiring of expert
consultants to determine if they even apply to you or your
property”). And because the CWA can sweep broadly enough to
criminalize mundane activities like moving dirt, this unchecked
definition of “the waters of the United States” means
that a staggering array of landowners are at risk of criminal
prosecution or onerous civil penalties.

															What are landowners to do if they want to build
on their property? The EPA recommends asking the Corps for a
jurisdictional determination, which is a written decision on
whether a particular site contains covered waters. Tr. of Oral Arg.
86; see Corps, Regulatory Guidance Letter No. 16–01, at 1
(2016) (RGL 16–01); 33 CFR §§320.1(a)(6), 331.2.
But the Corps maintains that it has no obligation to provide
jurisdictional determinations, RGL 16–01, at 2, and it has
already begun announcing exceptions to the legal effect of some
previous determinations, see 88 Fed. Reg. 3136. Even if the Corps
is willing to provide a jurisdictional determination, a property
owner may find it necessary to retain an expensive expert
consultant who is capable of putting together a presentation that
stands a chance of persuading the Corps.[12] And even then, a landowner’s chances of
success are low, as the EPA admits that the Corps finds
jurisdiction approximately 75% of the time. Tr. of Oral Arg.
110.

															If the landowner is among the vast majority who
receive adverse jurisdictional determinations, what then? It would
be foolish to go ahead and build since the jurisdictional
determination might form evidence of culpability in a prosecution
or civil action. The jurisdictional determination could be
challenged in court, but only after the delay and expense required
to exhaust the administrative appeals process. See 33 CFR
§331.7(d). And once in court, the landowner would face an
uphill battle under the deferential standards of review that the
agencies enjoy. See 5 U. S. C. §706. Another
alternative would be simply to acquiesce and seek a permit from the
Corps. But that process can take years and cost an exorbitant
amount of money. Many landowners faced with this unappetizing menu
of options would simply choose to build nothing.

															III

															With this history in mind, we now consider the
extent of the CWA’s geographical reach.

															A

															We start, as we always do, with the text of
the CWA. Bartenwerfer v. Buckley, 598 U.S. 69, 74
(2023). As noted, the Act applies to “navigable
waters,” which had a well-established meaning at the time of
the CWA’s enactment. But the CWA complicates matters by
proceeding to define “navigable waters” as “the
waters of the United States,” §1362(7), which was
decidedly not a well-known term of art. This frustrating drafting
choice has led to decades of litigation, but we must try to make
sense of the terms Congress chose to adopt. And for the reasons
explained below, we conclude that the Rapanos plurality was
correct: the CWA’s use of “waters” encompasses
“only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously
flowing bodies of water ‘forming geographic[al]
features’ that are described in ordinary parlance as
‘streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes.’ ” 547
U. S., at 739 (quoting Webster’s New International
Dictionary 2882 (2d ed. 1954) (Webster’s Second); original
alterations omitted).

															This reading follows from the CWA’s
deliberate use of the plural term “waters.” See 547
U. S., at 732–733. That term typically refers to bodies
of water like those listed above. See, e.g., Webster’s
Second 2882; Black’s Law Dictionary 1426 (5th ed. 1979)
(“especially in the plural, [water] may designate a body of
water, such as a river, a lake, or an ocean, or an aggregate of
such bodies of water, as in the phrases ‘foreign
waters,’ ‘waters of the United States,’
and the like” (emphasis added)); Random House Dictionary of
the English Language 2146 (2d ed. 1987) (Random House Dictionary)
(defining “waters” as “a. flowing water, or water
moving in waves: The river’s mighty waters. b. the sea or
seas bordering a particular country or continent or located in a
particular part of the world” (emphasis deleted)). This
meaning is hard to reconcile with classifying
“ ‘ “lands,” wet or otherwise, as
“waters.” ’ ” Rapanos, 547
U. S., at 740 (plurality opinion) (quoting Riverside
Bayview, 474 U. S., at 132).

															This reading also helps to align the meaning of
“the waters of the United States” with the term it is
defining: “navigable waters.” See Bond v.
United States, 572 U.S.
844, 861 (2014) (“In settling on a fair reading of a
statute, it is not unusual to consider the ordinary meaning of a
defined term, particularly when there is dissonance between that
ordinary meaning and the reach of the definition”). Although
we have acknowledged that the CWA extends to more than traditional
navigable waters, we have refused to read “navigable”
out of the statute, holding that it at least shows that Congress
was focused on “its traditional jurisdiction over waters that
were or had been navigable in fact or which could reasonably be so
made.” SWANCC, 531 U. S., at 172; see also
Appalachian Electric, 311 U. S., at 406–407;
The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall., at 563. At a minimum, then, the
use of “navigable” signals that the definition
principally refers to bodies of navigable water like rivers, lakes,
and oceans. See Rapanos, 547 U. S., at 734 (plurality
opinion).

															More broadly, this reading accords with how
Congress has employed the term “waters” elsewhere in
the CWA and in other laws. The CWA repeatedly uses
“waters” in contexts that confirm the term refers to
bodies of open water. See 33 U. S. C. §1267(i)(2)(D)
(“the waters of the Chesapeake Bay”);
§1268(a)(3)(I) (“the open waters of each of the Great
Lakes”); §1324(d)(4)(B)(ii) (“lakes and other
surface waters”); §1330(g)(4)(C)(vii) (“estuarine
waters”); §1343(c)(1) (“the waters of the
territorial seas, the contiguous zone, and the oceans”);
§§1346(a)(1), 1375a(a) (“coastal recreation
waters”); §1370 (state “boundary waters”).
The use of “waters” elsewhere in the U. S. Code
likewise correlates to rivers, lakes, and oceans.[13]

															Statutory history points in the same direction.
The CWA’s predecessor statute covered “interstate or
navigable waters” and defined “interstate waters”
as “all rivers, lakes, and other waters
that flow across or form a part of State boundaries.” 33
U. S. C. §§1160(a), 1173(e) (1970 ed.)
(emphasis added); see also Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, 30Stat.
1151 (codified, as amended, at 33 U. S. C. §403)
(prohibiting unauthorized obstructions “to the navigable
capacity of any of the waters of the United States”).

															This Court has understood the CWA’s use of
“waters” in the same way. Even as Riverside
Bayview grappled with whether adjacent wetlands could fall
within the CWA’s coverage, it acknowledged that wetlands are
not included in “traditional notions of
‘waters.’ ” 474 U. S., at 133. It
explained that the term conventionally refers to
“hydrographic features” like “rivers” and
“streams.” Id., at 131. SWANCC went even
further, repeatedly describing the “waters” covered by
the Act as “open water” and suggesting that “the
waters of the United States” principally refers to
traditional navigable waters. 531 U. S., at 168–169,
172. That our CWA decisions operated under this assumption is
unsurprising. Ever since Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1
(1824), this Court has used “waters of the United
States” to refer to similar bodies of water, almost always in
relation to ships. Id., at 218 (discussing a vessel’s
“conduct in the waters of the United States”).[14]

															The EPA argues that “waters” is
“naturally read to encompass wetlands” because the
“presence of water is ‘universally regarded as the most
basic feature of wetlands.’ ” Brief for
Respondents 19. But that reading proves too much. Consider puddles,
which are also defined by the ordinary presence of water even
though few would describe them as “waters.” This
argument is also tough to square with SWANCC, which held
that the Act does not cover isolated ponds, see 531 U. S., at
171, or Riverside Bayview, which would have had no need to
focus so extensively on the adjacency of wetlands to covered waters
if the EPA’s reading were correct, see 474 U. S., at
131–135, and n. 8. Finally, it is also instructive that
the CWA expressly “protect[s] the primary responsibilities
and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate
pollution” and “to plan the development and use
. . . of land and water resources.” §1251(b).
It is hard to see how the States’ role in regulating water
resources would remain “primary” if the EPA had
jurisdiction over anything defined by the presence of water. See
County of Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund, 590
U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 7); Rapanos, 547
U. S., at 737 (plurality opinion).

															B

															Although the ordinary meaning of
“waters” in §1362(7) might seem to exclude all
wetlands, we do not view that provision in isolation. The meaning
of a word “may only become evident when placed in
context,” FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco
Corp., 529 U.S.
120, 132 (2000), and statutory context shows that some wetlands
qualify as “waters of the United States.”

															In 1977, Congress amended the CWA and added
§1344(g)(1), which authorizes States to apply to the EPA for
permission to administer programs to issue permits for the
discharge of dredged or fill material into some bodies of water. In
simplified terms, the provision specifies that state permitting
programs may regulate discharges into (1) any waters of the United
States, (2) except for traditional navigable waters, (3)
“including wetlands adjacent thereto.”[15]

															When this convoluted formulation is parsed, it
tells us that at least some wetlands must qualify as “waters
of the United States.” The provision begins with a broad
category, “the waters of the United States,” which we
may call category A. The provision provides that States may permit
discharges into these waters, but it then qualifies that States
cannot permit discharges into a subcategory of A: traditional
navigable waters (category B). Finally, it states that a third
category (category C), consisting of wetlands
“adjacent” to traditional navigable waters, is
“includ[ed]” within B. Thus, States may permit
discharges into A minus B, which includes C. If C (adjacent
wetlands) were not part of A (“the waters of the United
States”) and therefore subject to regulation under the CWA,
there would be no point in excluding them from that category. See
Riverside Bayview, 474 U. S., at 138, n. 11
(recognizing that §1344(g) “at least suggest[s] strongly
that the term ‘waters’ as used in the Act does not
necessarily exclude ‘wetlands’ ”);
Rapanos, 547 U. S., at 768 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).
Thus, §1344(g)(1) presumes that certain wetlands constitute
“waters of the United States.”

															But what wetlands does the CWA regulate? Section
1344(g)(1) cannot answer that question alone because it is not the
operative provision that defines the Act’s reach. See
Riverside Bayview, 474 U. S., at 138, n. 11.
Instead, we must harmonize the reference to adjacent wetlands in
§1344(g)(1) with “the waters of the United
States,” §1362(7), which is the actual term we are
tasked with interpreting. The formulation discussed above tells us
how: because the adjacent wetlands in §1344(g)(1) are
“includ[ed]” within “the waters of the United
States,” these wetlands must qualify as “waters of the
United States” in their own right. In other words, they must
be indistinguishably part of a body of water that itself
constitutes “waters” under the CWA. See supra,
at 14.

															This understanding is consistent with
§1344(g)(1)’s use of “adjacent.”
Dictionaries tell us that the term “adjacent” may mean
either “contiguous” or “near.” Random House
Dictionary 25; see Webster’s Third New International
Dictionary 26 (1976); see also Oxford American Dictionary &
Thesaurus 16 (2d ed. 2009) (listing “adjoining” and
“neighboring” as synonyms of “adjacent”).
But “construing statutory language is not merely an exercise
in ascertaining ‘the outer limits of a word’s
definitional possibilities,’ ” FCC v.
AT&T Inc., 562 U.S.
397, 407 (2011) (alterations omitted), and here, “only
one . . . meanin[g] produces a substantive effect that is
compatible with the rest of the law,” United Sav. Assn. of
Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates,
Ltd., 484 U.S.
365, 371 (1988). Wetlands that are separate from traditional
navigable waters cannot be considered part of those waters, even if
they are located nearby.

															In addition, it would be odd indeed if Congress
had tucked an important expansion to the reach of the CWA into
convoluted language in a relatively obscure provision concerning
state permitting programs. We have often remarked that Congress
does not “hide elephants in mouseholes” by
“alter[ing] the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in
vague terms or ancillary provisions.” Whitman v.
American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.S.
457, 468 (2001). We cannot agree with such an implausible
interpretation here.

															If §1344(g)(1) were read to mean that the
CWA applies to wetlands that are not indistinguishably part of
otherwise covered “waters of the United States,” see
supra, at 14, it would effectively amend and substantially
broaden §1362(7) to define “navigable waters” as
“waters of the United States and adjacent
wetlands.” But §1344(g)(1)’s use of the term
“including” makes clear that it does not purport to
do—and in fact, does not do—any such thing. See
National Assn. of Home Builders v. Defenders of
Wildlife, 551 U.S.
644, 662–664, and n. 8 (2007) (recognizing that
implied amendments require “ ‘clear and
manifest’ ” evidence of congressional intent). It
merely reflects Congress’s assumption that certain
“adjacent” wetlands are part of “waters of
the United States.”

															This is the thrust of observations in decisions
going all the way back to Riverside Bayview. In that case,
we deferred to the Corps’ decision to regulate wetlands
actually abutting a navigable waterway, but we recognized
“the inherent difficulties of defining precise bounds to
regulable waters.” 474 U. S., at 134; see also
id., at 132 (noting that “the transition from water to
solid ground is not necessarily or even typically an abrupt
one” due to semi-aquatic features like shallows and swamps).
In such a situation, we concluded, the Corps could reasonably
determine that wetlands “adjoining bodies of water”
were part of those waters. Id., at 135, and n. 9; see
also SWANCC, 531 U. S., at 167 (recognizing that
Riverside Bayview “held that the Corps had
. . . jurisdiction over wetlands that actually abutted on
a navigable waterway”).

															In Rapanos, the plurality spelled out
clearly when adjacent wetlands are part of covered waters. It
explained that “waters” may fairly be read to include
only those wetlands that are “as a practical matter
indistinguishable from waters of the United States,” such
that it is “difficult to determine where the
‘water’ ends and the ‘wetland’
begins.” 547 U. S., at 742, 755 (emphasis deleted). That
occurs when wetlands have “a continuous surface connection to
bodies that are ‘waters of the United States’ in their
own right, so that there is no clear demarcation between
‘waters’ and wetlands.” Id., at 742; cf.
33 U. S. C. §2802(5) (defining “coastal
waters” to include wetlands “having unimpaired
connection with the open sea up to the head of tidal
influence”). We agree with this formulation of when wetlands
are part of “the waters of the United States.” We also
acknowledge that temporary interruptions in surface connection may
sometimes occur because of phenomena like low tides or dry
spells.[16]

															In sum, we hold that the CWA extends to only
those wetlands that are “as a practical matter
indistinguishable from waters of the United States.”
Rapanos, 547 U. S., at 755 (plurality opinion)
(emphasis deleted). This requires the party asserting jurisdiction
over adjacent wetlands to establish “first, that the adjacent
[body of water constitutes] . . . ‘water[s] of the
United States,’ (i.e., a relatively permanent body of
water connected to traditional interstate navigable waters); and
second, that the wetland has a continuous surface connection with
that water, making it difficult to determine where the
‘water’ ends and the ‘wetland’
begins.” Id., at 742.

															IV

															The EPA resists this reading of §1362(7)
and instead asks us to defer to its understanding of the
CWA’s jurisdictional reach, as set out in its most recent
rule defining “the waters of the United States.” See 88
Fed. Reg. 3004. This rule, as noted, provides that “adjacent
wetlands are covered by the Act if they ‘possess a
“significant nexus” to’ traditional navigable
waters.” Brief for Respondents 32 (quoting Rapanos,
547 U. S., at 759 (opinion of Kennedy, J.)); see 88 Fed. Reg.
3143. And according to the EPA, wetlands are “adjacent”
when they are “neighboring” to covered waters, even if
they are separated from those waters by dry land. Brief for
Respondents 20; 88 Fed. Reg. 3144.

															A

															For reasons already explained, this
interpretation is inconsistent with the text and structure of the
CWA. Beyond that, it clashes with “background principles of
construction” that apply to the interpretation of the
relevant statutory provisions. Bond, 572 U. S., at 857.
Under those presumptions, the EPA must provide clear evidence that
it is authorized to regulate in the manner it proposes.

															1

															First, this Court “require[s] Congress
to enact exceedingly clear language if it wishes to significantly
alter the balance between federal and state power and the power of
the Government over private property.” United States
Forest Service v. Cowpasture River Preservation Assn.,
590 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2020) (slip op., at
15–16); see also Bond, 572 U. S., at 858.
Regulation of land and water use lies at the core of traditional
state authority. See, e.g., SWANCC, 531 U. S.,
at 174 (citing Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson
Corporation, 513 U.S.
30, 44 (1994)); Tarrant Regional Water Dist. v.
Herrmann, 569 U.S.
614, 631 (2013). An overly broad interpretation of the
CWA’s reach would impinge on this authority. The area covered
by wetlands alone is vast—greater than the combined surface
area of California and Texas. And the scope of the EPA’s
conception of “the waters of the United States” is
truly staggering when this vast territory is supplemented by all
the additional area, some of which is generally dry, over which the
Agency asserts jurisdiction. Particularly given the CWA’s
express policy to “preserve” the States’
“primary” authority over land and water use,
§1251(b), this Court has required a clear statement from
Congress when determining the scope of “the waters of the
United States.” SWANCC, 531 U. S., at 174;
accord, Rapanos, 547 U. S., at 738 (plurality
opinion).

															The EPA, however, offers only a passing attempt
to square its interpretation with the text of §1362(7), and
its “significant nexus” theory is particularly
implausible. It suggests that the meaning of “the waters of
the United States” is so “broad and unqualified”
that, if viewed in isolation, it would extend to all water in the
United States. Brief for Respondents 32. The EPA thus turns to the
“significant nexus” test in order to reduce the clash
between its understanding of “the waters of the United
States” and the term defined by that phrase, i.e.,
“navigable waters.” As discussed, however, the meaning
of “waters” is more limited than the EPA believes. See
supra, at 14. And, in any event, the CWA never mentions the
“significant nexus” test, so the EPA has no statutory
basis to impose it. See Rapanos, 547 U. S., at
755–756 (plurality opinion).

															2

															Second, the EPA’s interpretation gives
rise to serious vagueness concerns in light of the CWA’s
criminal penalties. Due process requires Congress to define penal
statutes “ ‘with sufficient definiteness that
ordinary people can understand what conduct is
prohibited’ ” and “ ‘in a manner
that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory
enforcement.’ ” McDonnell v. United
States, 579 U.S. 550, 576 (2016) (quoting Skilling v.
United States, 561 U.S.
358, 402–403 (2010)). Yet the meaning of “waters of
the United States” under the EPA’s interpretation
remains “hopelessly indeterminate.” Sackett, 566
U. S., at 133 (Alito, J., concurring); accord, Hawkes
Co., 578 U. S., at 602 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).

															The EPA contends that the only thing preventing
it from interpreting “waters of the United States” to
“conceivably cover literally every body of water in the
country” is the significant-nexus test. Tr. of Oral Arg.
70–71; accord, Brief for Respondents 32. But the boundary
between a “significant” and an insignificant nexus is
far from clear. And to add to the uncertainty, the test introduces
another vague concept—“similarly situated”
waters—and then assesses the aggregate effect of that group
based on a variety of open-ended factors that evolve as scientific
understandings change. This freewheeling inquiry provides little
notice to landowners of their obligations under the CWA. Facing
severe criminal sanctions for even negligent violations, property
owners are “left ‘to feel their way on a case-by-case
basis.’ ” Sackett, 566 U. S., at 124
(quoting Rapanos, 547 U. S., at 758 (Roberts,
C. J., concurring)). Where a penal statute could sweep so
broadly as to render criminal a host of what might otherwise be
considered ordinary activities, we have been wary about going
beyond what “Congress certainly intended the statute to
cover.” Skilling, 561 U. S., at 404.

															Under these two background principles, the
judicial task when interpreting “the waters of the United
States” is to ascertain whether clear congressional
authorization exists for the EPA’s claimed power. The
EPA’s interpretation falls far short of that standard.

															B

															While mustering only a weak textual argument,
the EPA justifies its position on two other grounds. It primarily
claims that Congress implicitly ratified its interpretation of
“adjacent” wetlands when it adopted §1344(g)(1).
Thus, it argues that “waters of the United States”
covers any wetlands that are “bordering, contiguous, or
neighboring” to covered waters. 88 Fed. Reg. 3143. The
principal opinion concurring in the judgment adopts the same
position. See post, at 10–12 (Kavanaugh, J.,
concurring in judgment). The EPA notes that the Corps had
promulgated regulations adopting that interpretation before
Congress amended the CWA in 1977 to include the reference to
“adjacent” wetlands in §1344(g)(1). See 42 Fed.
Reg. 37144. This term, the EPA contends, was
“ ‘ “obviously transplanted
from” ’ ” the Corps’ regulations
and thus incorporates the same definition. Brief for Respondents 22
(quoting Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U. S. ___, ___
(2019) (slip op., at 5)).

															This argument fails for at least three reasons.
First, as we have explained, the text of §§1362(7) and
1344(g)(1) shows that “adjacent” cannot include
wetlands that are not part of covered “waters.” See
supra, at 22.

															Second, this ratification theory cannot be
reconciled with our cases. We have repeatedly recognized that
§1344(g)(1) “ ‘does not conclusively
determine the construction to be placed on . . . the
relevant definition of “navigable
waters.” ’ ” SWANCC, 531
U. S., at 171 (quoting Riverside Bayview, 474
U. S., at 138, n. 11); accord, Rapanos, 547
U. S., at 747–748, n. 12 (plurality opinion).
Additionally, SWANCC rejected the closely analogous argument
that Congress ratified the Corps’ definition of “waters
of the United States” by including “ ‘other
. . . waters’ ” in §1344(g)(1). 531
U. S., at 168–171. And yet, the EPA’s argument
would require us to hold that §1344(g)(1) actually did amend
the definition of “navigable waters” precisely for the
reasons we rejected in SWANCC.

															Third, the EPA cannot provide the sort of
“overwhelming evidence of acquiescence” necessary to
support its argument in the face of Congress’s failure to
amend §1362(7). Id., at 169–170, n. 5. We
will infer that a term was “ ‘transplanted from
another legal source’ . . . only when a
term’s meaning was ‘well-settled’ before the
transplantation.” Kemp v. United States, 596
U. S. ___, ___–___ (2022) (slip op., at 9–10). Far
from being well settled, the Corps’ definition was
promulgated mere months before the CWA became law, and when the
Corps adopted that definition, it candidly acknowledged the
“rapidly changing nature of [its] regulatory programs.”
42 Fed. Reg. 37122. Tellingly, even the EPA would not adopt that
definition for several more years. See 45 Fed. Reg. 85345 (1980).
This situation is a far cry from any in which we have found
ratification. See, e.g., George v. McDonough,
596 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 5) (finding
ratification when “Congress used an unusual term that had a
long regulatory history in [the] very regulatory context” at
issue).

															The EPA also advances various policy arguments
about the ecological consequences of a narrower definition of
adjacent. But the CWA does not define the EPA’s jurisdiction
based on ecological importance, and we cannot redraw the
Act’s allocation of authority. See Rapanos, 547
U. S., at 756 (plurality opinion). “The Clean Water Act
anticipates a partnership between the States and the Federal
Government.” Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U.S.
91, 101 (1992). States can and will continue to exercise their
primary authority to combat water pollution by regulating land and
water use. See, e.g., Brief for Farm Bureau of Arkansas
et al. as Amici Curiae 17–27.

															V

															Nothing in the separate opinions filed by
Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Kagan undermines our analysis.
Justice Kavanaugh claims that we have “rewrit[ten]” the
CWA, post, at 12 (opinion concurring in judgment), and
Justice Kagan levels similar charges, post, at 3–4
(opinion concurring in judgment). These arguments are more than
unfounded. We have analyzed the statutory language in detail, but
the separate opinions pay no attention whatsoever to §1362(7),
the key statutory provision that limits the CWA’s geographic
reach to “the waters of the United States.”
Thus, neither separate opinion even attempts to explain how the
wetlands included in their interpretation fall within a fair
reading of “waters.” Textualist arguments that ignore
the operative text cannot be taken seriously.

															VI

															In sum, we hold that the CWA extends to only
those “wetlands with a continuous surface connection to
bodies that are ‘waters of the United States’ in their
own right,” so that they are “indistinguishable”
from those waters. Rapanos, 547 U. S., at 742, 755
(plurality opinion) (emphasis deleted); see supra, at 22.
This holding compels reversal here. The wetlands on the
Sacketts’ property are distinguishable from any possibly
covered waters.

															*  *  *

															We reverse the judgment of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

or are susceptible to use in their natural condition or by
reasonable improvement as a means to transport interstate or
foreign commerce shoreward to their ordinary high water mark,
including all waters which are subject to the ebb and flow of the
tide shoreward to their mean high water mark, or mean higher high
water mark on the west coast, including wetlands adjacent thereto)
within its jurisdiction may submit to the Administrator a full and
complete description of the program it proposes to establish and
administer under State law or under an interstate compact.”
33 U. S. C. §1344(g)(1).
16  Although a barrier separating a
wetland from a water of the United States would ordinarily remove
that wetland from federal jurisdiction, a landowner cannot carve
out wetlands from federal jurisdiction by illegally constructing a
barrier on wetlands otherwise covered by the CWA. Whenever the EPA
can exercise its statutory authority to order a barrier’s
removal because it violates the Act, see 33 U. S. C.
§§1319(a)–(b), that unlawful barrier poses no bar
to its jurisdiction.
