CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
Syllabus 

															Decided upon the authority of Price v. United States, ante, p.  269 U. S. 492, 6 F.2d 752, affirmed.

															MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

															In this case, there is presented the question whether, in the distribution of the assets of Johnson Shipyards Corporation among its creditors by receivers appointed in an equity suit, the United States, under R.S. ยง 3466, is entitled to have its claim against the corporation for taxes first satisfied.  The facts (300 F. 952) are in all respects similar to those in Price v. United States, ante, p.  269 U. S. 492.  The question of law involved is identical.  The United States is entitled to priority.

															Decree affirmed.
