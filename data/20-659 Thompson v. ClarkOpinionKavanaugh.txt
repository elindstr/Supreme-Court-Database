															LARRY THOMPSON, PETITIONER v. PAGIEL CLARK, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

															[April 4, 2022]

															Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the Court.

															Larry Thompson was charged and detained in state criminal proceedings, but the charges were dismissed before trial without any explanation by the prosecutor or judge.  After the dismissal, Thompson alleged that the police officers who initiated the criminal proceedings had “maliciously prosecuted” him without probable cause.  App. 33–34.  Thompson sued and sought money damages from those officers in federal court.  As relevant here, he advanced a
 
Fourth Amendment claim under

42 U. S. C. §1983 for malicious prosecution.

															To maintain that
 
Fourth Amendment claim under §1983, a plaintiff such as Thompson must demonstrate, among other things, that he obtained a favorable termination of the underlying criminal prosecution.  Cf. Heck v. Humphrey,

512 U.S. 477, 484, and n. 4 (1994).  This case requires us to flesh out what a favorable termination entails.  Does it suffice for a plaintiff to show that his criminal prosecution ended without a conviction?  Or must the plaintiff also demonstrate that the prosecution ended with some affirmative indication of his innocence, such as an acquittal or a dismissal accompanied by a statement from the judge that the evidence was insufficient?

															We conclude as follows: To demonstrate a favorable termination of a criminal prosecution for purposes of the
 
Fourth Amendment claim under §1983 for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff need only show that his prosecution ended without a conviction.  Thompson satisfied that requirement in this case.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															I

															Larry Thompson lived with his fiancée (now wife) and their newborn baby girl in an apartment in Brooklyn, New York.  In January 2014, Thompson’s sister-in-law was also staying there.  The sister-in-law apparently suffered from a mental illness.  One day that January, the sister-in-law called 911 and claimed that Thompson was sexually abusing his one-week-old baby daughter.  Two Emergency Medical Technicians promptly responded.  When the EMTs arrived at the family’s apartment, Thompson asked the EMTs why they were there and denied that anyone had called 911.  The EMTs left and informed the police of the situation.

															The EMTs and four police officers then returned to the apartment.  When they arrived, Thompson told them that they could not come in without a warrant.  The police officers nonetheless entered and, after a brief scuffle, handcuffed Thompson.  The EMTs followed the officers into the apartment and examined the baby.  After finding red marks on the baby’s body, the EMTs took the baby to the hospital for evaluation.  The marks turned out to be a case of diaper rash.  The medical professionals found no signs of abuse.

															Meanwhile, the police officers arrested Thompson for resisting their entry into the apartment.  Thompson was taken to a local hospital and then to jail.  While Thompson was in custody, one of the police officers prepared and filed a criminal complaint charging Thompson with obstructing governmental administration and resisting arrest.  Thompson remained in custody for two days.  A judge then released him on his own recognizance.

															Before trial, the prosecution moved to dismiss the charges, and the trial judge in turn dismissed the case.  The prosecutor did not explain why she sought to dismiss the charges, nor did the trial judge explain why he dismissed the case.

															After the criminal prosecution ended, Thompson brought suit for damages under

42 U. S. C. §1983 against the police officers who had arrested and charged him.  Thompson alleged several constitutional violations, including a
 
Fourth Amendment claim for “malicious prosecution.”  App. 33.  Thompson asserted that the officers “maliciously prosecuted” him and “subjected him to an unlawful, illegal and excessive detention” in violation of his
 
Fourth Amendment rights.  Id., at 34.

															To prevail on that claim under Second Circuit precedent, Thompson had to show that his criminal prosecution ended not merely without a conviction, but also with some affirmative indication of his innocence.  See Lanning v. Glens Falls, 908 F.3d 19, 22 (2018).  Thompson could not put forth any substantial evidence that would explain why the prosecutor had moved to dismiss the charges or why the trial court had dismissed the charges.  Therefore, the District Court ruled that Thompson’s criminal case had not ended in a way that affirmatively indicated his innocence.  The District Court granted judgment to the defendant officers on that
 
Fourth Amendment claim.  Notably, the District Court also opined that the relevant Second Circuit precedent “can and should be changed” to say that a favorable termination occurs so long as the prosecution ends without a conviction.  364 F. Supp. 3d 178, 181, 196–197 (EDNY 2019).  On appeal, however, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit adhered to its precedent in Lanning and affirmed the dismissal of Thompson’s
 
Fourth Amendment claim.  794 Fed. Appx. 140 (2020).

															The Courts of Appeals have split over how to apply the favorable termination requirement of the
 
Fourth Amendment claim under §1983 for malicious prosecution.  In addition to the Second Circuit, some other Courts of Appeals have held that a favorable termination requires some affirmative indication of innocence.  See, e.g., Kossler v. Crisanti, 564 F.3d 181, 187 (CA3 2009) (en banc); Cordova v. Albuquerque, 816 F.3d 645, 649 (CA10 2016).  By contrast, the Eleventh Circuit has held that a favorable termination occurs so long as the criminal prosecution ends without a conviction.  See Laskar v. Hurd, 972 F.3d 1278, 1282 (2020).  This Court granted certiorari to resolve the split.  592 U. S. ___ (2021).

															II

															A

															In 1871, Congress passed and President Grant signed the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  Section 1 of that Act, now codified at

42 U. S. C. §1983, created a species of federal tort liability for individuals to sue state and local officers for deprivations of constitutional rights.

															In this case, Thompson sued several police officers under §1983, alleging that he was “maliciously prosecuted” without probable cause and that he was seized as a result.  App. 33–34.  He brought a
 
Fourth Amendment claim under §1983 for malicious prosecution, sometimes referred to as a claim for unreasonable seizure pursuant to legal process.  This Court’s precedents recognize such a claim.  See Manuel v. Joliet,

580 U.S. 357, 363–364, 367–368 (2017); Albright v. Oliver,

510 U.S. 266, 271 (1994) (plurality opinion); see also id., at 290–291 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment).  And following this Court’s precedents, the District Courts and Courts of Appeals have decided numerous cases involving
 
Fourth Amendment claims under §1983 for malicious prosecution.  See, e.g., Pitt v. District of Columbia, 491 F.3d 494, 510–511 (CADC 2007) (“[N]early every other Circuit has held that malicious prosecution is actionable under the
 
Fourth Amendment to the extent that the defendant’s actions cause the plaintiff to be ‘seized’ without probable cause”); Kossler, 564 F. 3d, at 186–187; Sykes v. Anderson, 625 F.3d 294, 308–309 (CA6 2010); Durham v. Horner, 690 F.3d 183, 188 (CA4 2012); Myers v. Koopman, 738 F.3d 1190, 1194 (CA10 2013); Winfrey v. Rogers, 901 F.3d 483, 491–493 (CA5 2018); Lanning, 908 F. 3d, at 28; Jordan v. Waldoboro, 943 F.3d 532, 545 (CA1 2019); Williams v. Aguirre, 965 F.3d 1147, 1157 (CA11 2020).[1]

															The narrow dispute in this case concerns one element of the
 
Fourth Amendment claim under §1983 for malicious prosecution.  To determine the elements of a constitutional claim under §1983, this Court’s practice is to first look to the elements of the most analogous tort as of 1871 when §1983 was enacted, so long as doing so is consistent with “the values and purposes of the constitutional right at issue.”  Manuel, 580 U. S., at 370; see also Nieves v. Bartlett, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 12); Heck, 512 U. S., at 483.[2]

															Here, as most of the Courts of Appeals to consider the question have determined, the most analogous tort to this
 
Fourth Amendment claim is malicious prosecution.  See Kossler, 564 F. 3d, at 186; Sykes, 625 F. 3d, at 308–309; Durham, 690 F. 3d, at 188; Myers, 738 F. 3d, at 1194; Lanning, 908 F. 3d, at 28; Jordan, 943 F. 3d, at 545.  That is because the gravamen of the
 
Fourth Amendment claim for malicious prosecution, as this Court has recognized it, is the wrongful initiation of charges without probable cause.  And the wrongful initiation of charges without probable cause is likewise the gravamen of the tort of malicious prosecution.

															In American courts as of 1871, the malicious prosecution tort generally allowed recovery against an individual who had initiated or caused the initiation of criminal proceedings despite having “no good reason to believe” that criminal charges were “justified by the facts and the law.”  T. Cooley, Law of Torts 180 (1880) (Cooley); see also 1 F. Hilliard, The Law of Torts or Private Wrongs 412–414 (1866) (Hilliard).  The malicious prosecution tort protected against “injury to the person, as connected with false imprisonment” and against “a wrong to character or reputation.”  Id., at 412 (emphasis deleted).

															American courts described the elements of the malicious prosecution tort as follows: (i) the suit or proceeding was “instituted without any probable cause”; (ii) the “motive in instituting” the suit “was malicious,” which was often defined in this context as without probable cause and for a purpose other than bringing the defendant to justice; and (iii) the prosecution “terminated in the acquittal or discharge of the accused.”  Cooley 181.[3]

															That third requirement—a favorable termination of the underlying criminal prosecution—is the focus of the parties’ dispute in this case.

															B

															In accord with the elements of the malicious prosecution tort, a
 
Fourth Amendment claim under §1983 for malicious prosecution requires the plaintiff to show a favorable termination of the underlying criminal case against him.  The favorable termination requirement serves multiple purposes: (i) it avoids parallel litigation in civil and criminal proceedings over the issues of probable cause and guilt; (ii) it precludes inconsistent civil and criminal judgments where a claimant could succeed in the tort action after having been convicted in the criminal case; and (iii) it prevents civil suits from being improperly used as collateral attacks on criminal proceedings.  Cf. Heck, 512 U. S., at 484–485; see also McDonough v. Smith, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 7).

															The parties to this case disagree about what a favorable termination entails.  In particular, does it suffice for a plaintiff to show that his prosecution ended without a conviction?  Or must the plaintiff also show that his prosecution ended with some affirmative indication of innocence, such as an acquittal or a dismissal accompanied by a statement from the judge that the evidence was insufficient?

															To resolve that disagreement, we must look to American malicious prosecution tort law as of 1871.  See Nieves, 587 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  In most American courts that had considered the question as of 1871, the favorable termination element of a malicious prosecution claim was satisfied so long as the prosecution ended without a conviction.  As one influential New York decision explained, when the individual was “convicted in the suit or proceeding complained of,” he could not maintain an action for malicious prosecution.  Clark v. Cleveland, 6 Hill 344, 346, n. a (1844).  But when the individual was not convicted, the “question is, whether the prosecution instituted by the defendant can be said to have been terminated, disposed of, or, as the books usually say, at an end.”  Id., at 346.  The “technical prerequisite is only that the particular prosecution be disposed of in such a manner” that it “cannot be revived.”  Id., at 347; Bacon v. Waters, 84 Mass. 400, 401–402 (1861); M. Newell, Law of Malicious Prosecution 327–328 (1892) (Newell).

															On that point, American courts as of 1871 were largely in agreement.  To take one example, the Supreme Court of Indiana ruled that a dismissal satisfied the favorable termination requirement because it marked “an end to further proceedings against the defendant” on the charges.  Chapman v. Woods, 6 Blackf. 504, 505–506 (1843).  Similarly, the Supreme Court of Tennessee concluded that a suit was proper when “the prosecution was at an end.”  Pharis v. Lambert, 33 Tenn. 228, 232 (1853).

															For that reason, a plaintiff could maintain a malicious prosecution claim when, for example, the prosecutor abandoned the criminal case or the court dismissed the case without providing a reason.  See, e.g., Fay v. O’Neill, 36 N.Y. 11, 13 (1867); Murray v. Lackey, 6 N. C. 368, 368–369 (1818); Driggs v. Burton, 44 Vt. 124, 143–144 (1871); Brown v. Randall, 36 Conn. 56, 61–63 (1869); Chapman, 6 Blackf., at 505–506; Sayles v. Briggs, 45 Mass. 421, 425–426 (1842); Yocum v. Polly, 40 Ky. 358, 359 (1841); Burhans v. Sanford, 19 Wend. 417, 418 (N. Y. 1838); Cotton v. Wilson, Minor 203 (Ala. 1824).

															Several courts explicitly added, moreover, that a favorable termination did not require an acquittal or a dismissal accompanied by some affirmative indication of innocence.  In the words of one court, it “is not to be understood, that an action, for a malicious prosecution, will not lie, unless the party has been acquitted by a jury on trial.”  Thomas v. DeGraffenreid, 11 S. C. L. 143, 144–145 (1819).  “On the contrary, a person may have his action after a bill rejected by the grand jury, or even where no bill has been preferred, if there is a final end of the prosecution, and the party discharged.”  Id., at 145; see also Chapman, 6 Blackf., at 505–506.

															The treatises of that era agreed that a favorable termination occurred so long as the prosecution ended without conviction.  Cooley’s tort-law treatise stated, for example, that “the reasonable rule seems to be, that the technical prerequisite is only that the particular prosecution be disposed of in such a manner that this cannot be revived, and the prosecutor, if he proceeds further, will be put to a new one.”  Cooley 186; see also Newell 343 (expressing approval of the rule); Hilliard 453, and n. 5 (recognizing the rule).

															The parties to this case have identified only one court that required something more, such as an acquittal or a dismissal accompanied by some affirmative indication of innocence.  In 1863, the Rhode Island Supreme Court concluded, “with reluctance,” that “ ‘the termination must be such as to furnish prima facie evidence that the action was without foundation.’ ”  Rounds v. Humes, 7 R. I. 535, 537 (1863).  But Rhode Island stood as an outlier on that question.  The other American courts to consider the issue did not require some affirmative indication of innocence in order for a malicious prosecution tort claim to proceed.  The courts simply required that the prosecution ended in the defendant’s favor.  As Chief Judge Pryor explained in his comprehensive opinion for the Eleventh Circuit in Laskar v. Hurd, 972 F. 3d, at 1287: “The clear majority of American courts did not limit favorable terminations to those that suggested the accused’s innocence.”

															Against that body of precedent and historical practice, respondent Clark contends that American courts as of 1871 had not settled on any particular favorable termination rule.  But the cases and treatises that respondent latches onto addressed a separate issue—not whether the prosecution had terminated in the defendant’s favor, but whether the prosecution had terminated at all.  In particular, courts divided over whether a prosecutor’s dismissal without discharge by a judge in fact terminated a prosecution.  Some courts concluded that a prosecution ended when the prosecutor dismissed the case, even if the court had not yet taken action.  See, e.g., Woodman v. Prescott, 66 N. H. 375, 376–377 (1890); see also 1 F. Hilliard, The Law of Torts or Private Wrongs 475 (1874); Newell 327–328; Cooley 186.  Other courts said that a prosecution did not end until a judge discharged, or formally released, the defendant from the case.  See, e.g., DeGraffenreid, 11 S. C. L., at 145; Paukett v. Livermore, 5 Iowa 277, 282 (1857).

															But those cases did not purport to alter the basic favorable termination principle—namely, that a malicious prosecution claim could proceed when the prosecution terminated without a conviction.

															Respondent also seizes on a comment in the American Law Institute’s 1976 Second Restatement of Torts (as have most of the Courts of Appeals that have sided with respondent’s position on this issue).  See Jordan, 943 F. 3d, at 545–546; Lanning, 908 F. 3d, at 26; Salley v. Myers, 971 F.3d 308, 312–313 (CA4 2020); Jones v. Clark Cty., 959 F.3d 748, 763–765 (CA6 2020); Cordova, 816 F. 3d, at 651.  The comment in the Second Restatement opined that, for purposes of a malicious prosecution claim, a criminal case terminates “in favor of the accused” when the prosecution ends in a way “as to indicate the innocence of the accused.”  Restatement (Second) of Torts §660, and Comment a (1976).

															But respondent’s reliance on the 1976 Restatement is flawed because the Restatement did not purport to describe the consensus of American law as of 1871, at least on that question.  The status of American law as of 1871 is the relevant inquiry for our purposes.  See Manuel, 580 U. S., at 370; Nieves, 587 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12); Laskar, 972 F. 3d, at 1286.  And in the overwhelming majority of American jurisdictions that had considered the issue as of 1871, a plaintiff alleging malicious prosecution did not need to show that his prosecution had ended with some affirmative indication of innocence.

															Because the American tort-law consensus as of 1871 did not require a plaintiff in a malicious prosecution suit to show that his prosecution ended with an affirmative indication of innocence, we similarly construe the
 
Fourth Amendment claim under §1983 for malicious prosecution.  Doing so is consistent, moreover, with “the values and purposes” of the
 
Fourth Amendment.  Manuel, 580 U. S., at 370.  The question of whether a criminal defendant was wrongly charged does not logically depend on whether the prosecutor or court explained why the prosecution was dismissed.  And the individual’s ability to seek redress for a wrongful prosecution cannot reasonably turn on the fortuity of whether the prosecutor or court happened to explain why the charges were dismissed.  In addition, requiring the plaintiff to show that his prosecution ended with an affirmative indication of innocence would paradoxically foreclose a §1983 claim when the government’s case was weaker and dismissed without explanation before trial, but allow a claim when the government’s evidence was substantial enough to proceed to trial.  That would make little sense.  Finally, requiring a plaintiff to show that his prosecution ended with an affirmative indication of innocence is not necessary to protect officers from unwarranted civil suits—among other things, officers are still protected by the requirement that the plaintiff show the absence of probable cause and by qualified immunity.

															*  *  *

															In sum, we hold that a
 
Fourth Amendment claim under §1983 for malicious prosecution does not require the plaintiff to show that the criminal prosecution ended with some affirmative indication of innocence.  A plaintiff need only show that the criminal prosecution ended without a conviction.  Thompson has satisfied that requirement here.  We express no view, however, on additional questions that may be relevant on remand, including whether Thompson was ever seized as a result of the alleged malicious prosecution, whether he was charged without probable cause, and whether respondent is entitled to qualified immunity.  On remand, the Second Circuit or the District Court as appropriate may consider those and other pertinent questions.  We reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.
Notes
1
 Thompson also brought a
 
Fourth Amendment claim for unreasonable seizure (labeled a false arrest claim), based on his initial arrest before charges were filed against him.  But the jury ruled against him on the merits of that claim.  That claim is not before us, and we therefore do not consider it. 

2
 Because this claim is housed in the
 
Fourth Amendment, the plaintiff also has to prove that the malicious prosecution resulted in a seizure of the plaintiff.  See Manuel v. Joliet,

580 U.S. 357, 365–366 (2017).  It has been argued that the Due Process Clause could be an appropriate analytical home for a malicious prosecution claim under §1983.  See Albright v. Oliver,

510 U.S. 266, 281, 286 (1994) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  If so, the plaintiff presumably would not have to prove that he was seized as a result of the malicious prosecution.  But we have no occasion to consider such an argument here. 

3
 We need not decide whether a plaintiff bringing a
 
Fourth Amendment claim under §1983 for malicious prosecution must establish malice (or some other mens rea) in addition to the absence of probable cause.
