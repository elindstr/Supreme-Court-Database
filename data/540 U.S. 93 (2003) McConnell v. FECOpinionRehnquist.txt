for the district of columbia

															[December 10, 2003]

															   Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered
the opinion of the Court with respect to BCRA Titles III and
IV.*

															   This opinion addresses issues
involving miscellaneous Title III and IV provisions of the
Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 116 Stat. 81. For
the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the District
Court with respect to these provisions.

															BCRA §305
   BCRA §305 amends the
federal Communications Act of 1934 (Communications Act)
§315(b), 48 Stat. 1088, as amended, 86 Stat. 4, which requires
that, 45 days before a primary or 60 days before a general
election, broadcast stations must sell a qualified candidate the
“lowest unit charge of the station for the same class and
amount of time for the same period,” 47 U. S. C.
§315(b). Section 305’s amendment, in turn, denies a
candidate the benefit of that lowest unit charge unless the
candidate “provides written certification to the broadcast
station that the candidate (and any authorized committee of the
candidate) shall not make any direct reference to another candidate
for the same office,” or the candidate, in the manner
prescribed in BCRA §305(a)(3), clearly identifies herself at
the end of the broadcast and states that she approves of the
broadcast. 47 U. S. C. A. §§315(b)(2)(A), (C)
(Supp. 2003).
   The McConnell plaintiffs
challenge §305. They argue that Senator McConnell’s
testimony that he plans to run advertisements critical of his
opponents in the future and that he had run them in the past is
sufficient to establish standing. We think not.
   Article III of the Constitution limits the
“judicial power” to the resolution of
“cases” and “controversies.” One element of
the “bedrock” case-or-controversy requirement is that
plaintiffs must establish that they have standing to sue.
Raines v. Byrd, 521 U. S. 811, 818
(1997). On many occasions, we have reiterated the three
requirements that constitute the “ ‘irreducible
constitutional minimum’ ” of standing. Vermont
Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel.
Stevens, 529 U.
S. 765, 771 (2000). First, a plaintiff must demonstrate an
“injury in fact,” which is “concrete,”
“distinct and palpable,” and “actual or
imminent.” Whitmore v.
Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155
(1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Second, a
plaintiff must establish “a causal connection between the
injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be
‘fairly trace[able] to the challenged action of the
defendant, and not … th[e] result [of] some third party not
before the court.’ ” Lujan v.
Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555,
560–561 (1992) (quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky.
Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 41–42
(1976)). Third, a plaintiff must show the
“ ‘substantial likelihood’ that the
requested relief will remedy the alleged injury in fact.”
Stevens, supra, at 771.

															   As noted above, §305 amended the
Communication Act’s requirements with respect to the lowest
unit charge for broadcasting time. But this price is not available
to qualified candidates until 45 days before a primary election or
60 days before a general election. Because Senator
McConnell’s current term does not expire until 2009, the
earliest day he could be affected by §305 is 45 days before
the Republican primary election in 2008. This alleged injury in
fact is too remote temporally to satisfy Article III standing. See
Whitmore, supra, at 158 (“A threatened injury must
be certainly impending to constitute injury in
fact” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); see
also Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102 (1983)
(A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show he is
“ ‘immediately in danger of sustaining some direct
injury’ as [a] result” of the challenged conduct).
Because we hold that the McConnell plaintiffs lack standing to
challenge §305, we affirm the District Court’s dismissal
of the challenge to BCRA §305.

															BCRA §307
   BCRA §307, which amends
§315(a)(1) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971
(FECA), 86 Stat. 3, as added, 90 Stat. 487, increases and indexes
for inflation certain FECA contribution limits. The Adams and Paul
plaintiffs challenge §307 in this Court. Both groups contend
that they have standing to sue. Again, we disagree.
   The Adams plaintiffs, a group
consisting of voters, organizations representing voters, and
candidates, allege two injuries, and argue each is legally
cognizable, “as established by case law outlawing electoral
discrimination based on economic status … and upholding the
right to an equally meaningful vote … .” Brief
for Appellants Adams et al. in No. 02–1740,
p. 31.
   First, they assert that the increases in
hard money limits enacted by §307 deprive them of an equal
ability to participate in the election process based on their
economic status. But, to satisfy our standing requirements, a
plaintiff’s alleged injury must be an invasion of a concrete
and particularized legally protected interest. Lujan, supra,
at 560. We have noted that “[a]lthough standing in no way
depends on the merits of the plaintiff’s contention that
particular conduct is illegal, … it often turns on the
nature and source of the claim asserted.” Warth v.
Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 500
(1975) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We have
never recognized a legal right comparable to the broad and diffuse
injury asserted by the Adams plaintiffs. Their reliance on this
Court’s voting rights cases is misplaced. They rely on cases
requiring nondiscriminatory access to the ballot and a single,
equal vote for each voter. See, e.g., Lubin v.
Panish, 415 U. S. 709 (1974)
(invalidating a statute requiring a ballot-access fee fixed at a
percentage of the salary for the office sought because it
unconstitutionally burdened the right to vote); Harper v.
Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663,
666–668 (1966) (invalidating a state poll tax because it
effectively denied the right to vote).

															   None of these plaintiffs claims a denial of
equal access to the ballot or the right to vote. Instead, the
plaintiffs allege a curtailment of the scope of their participation
in the electoral process. But we have noted that “[p]olitical
‘free trade’ does not necessarily require that all who
participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal
resources.” Federal Election Comm’n v.
Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 257
(1986); see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 48 (1976)
(per curiam) (rejecting the asserted government interest
of “equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups
to influence the outcome of elections” to justify the burden
on speech presented by expenditure limits). This claim of injury by
the Adams plaintiffs is, therefore, not to a legally cognizable
right.

															   Second, the Adams plaintiffs-candidates
contend that they have suffered a competitive injury. Their
candidates “do not wish to solicit or accept large campaign
contributions as permitted by BCRA” because “[t]hey
believe such contributions create the appearance of unequal access
and influence.” Adams Complaint ¶ ;53. As a result, they
claim that BCRA §307 puts them at a “fundraising
disadvantage,” making it more difficult for them to compete
in elections. See id., ¶ ;56.

															   The second claimed injury is based on the same
premise as the first: BCRA §307’s increased hard money
limits allow plaintiffs-candidates’ opponents to raise more
money, and, consequently, the plaintiffs-candidates’ ability
to compete or participate in the electoral process is diminished.
But they cannot show that their alleged injury is “fairly
traceable” to BCRA §307. See Lujan, supra, at
562. Their alleged inability to compete stems not from the
operation of §307, but from their own personal
“wish” not to solicit or accept large contributions,
i.e., their personal choice. Accordingly, the Adams
plaintiffs fail here to allege an injury in fact that is
“fairly traceable” to BCRA.

															   The Paul plaintiffs maintain that BCRA
§307 violates the Freedom of Press Clause of the First
Amendment. They contend that their political campaigns and public
interest advocacy involve traditional press activities and that,
therefore, they are protected by the First Amendment’s
guarantee of the freedom of press. The Paul plaintiffs argue that
the contribution limits imposed by BCRA §307, together with
the individual and political action committee contribution
limitations of FECA §315, impose unconstitutional editorial
control upon candidates and their campaigns. The Paul plaintiffs
argue that by imposing economic burdens upon them, but not upon the
institutional media, see 2 U. S. C. §431(9)(B)(i)
(exempting “any news story, commentary, or editorial
distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station,
newspaper, magazine, or other periodical publication, unless such
facilities are owned or controlled by any political party,
political committee, or candidate” from the definition of
expenditure), BCRA §307 and FECA §315 violate the freedom
of the press.

															   The Paul plaintiffs cannot show the
“ ‘substantial likelihood’ that the
requested relief will remedy [their] alleged injury in fact,”
Stevens, 529 U. S., at 771. The relief the Paul plaintiffs
seek is for this Court to strike down the contribution limits,
removing the alleged disparate editorial controls and economic
burdens imposed on them. But §307 merely increased and indexed
for inflation certain FECA contribution limits. This Court has no
power to adjudicate a challenge to the FECA limits in this case
because challenges to the constitutionality of FECA provisions are
subject to direct review before an appropriate en banc court of
appeals, as provided in 2 U. S. C. §437h, not in the
three-judge District Court convened pursuant to BCRA §403(a).
Although the Court has jurisdiction to hear a challenge to
§307, if the Court were to strike down the increases and
indexes established by BCRA §307, it would not remedy the Paul
plaintiffs’ alleged injury because both the limitations
imposed by FECA and the exemption for news media would remain
unchanged. A ruling in the Paul plaintiffs’ favor, therefore,
would not redress their alleged injury, and they accordingly lack
standing. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better
Environment, 523
U. S. 83, 105–110 (1998).

															   For the reasons above, we affirm the District
Court’s dismissal of the Adams and Paul plaintiffs’
challenges to BCRA §307 for lack of standing.

															BCRA §§304, 316, and 319
   BCRA §§304 and 316,
which amend FECA §315, and BCRA §319, which adds FECA
§315A, collectively known as the “millionaire
provisions,” provide for a series of staggered increases in
otherwise applicable contribution-to-candidate limits if the
candidate’s opponent spends a triggering amount of his
personal funds.[Footnote 1] The
provisions also eliminate the coordinated expenditure limits in
certain circumstances.[Footnote
2]
   In their challenge to the
millionaire provisions, the Adams plaintiffs allege the same
injuries that they alleged with regard to BCRA §307. For the
reasons discussed above, they fail to allege a cognizable injury
that is “fairly traceable” to BCRA. Additionally, as
the District Court noted, “none of the Adams plaintiffs is a
candidate in an election affected by the millionaire
provisions—i.e., one in which an opponent chooses to
spend the triggering amount in his own funds—and it would be
purely ‘conjectural’ for the court to assume that any
plaintiff ever will be.” 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 431 (DC
2003) (case below) (Henderson, J., concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part) (quoting Lujan, 504 U. S., at
560). We affirm the District Court’s dismissal of the Adams
plaintiffs’ challenge to the millionaire provisions for lack
of standing.

															BCRA §311
   FECA §318 requires that
certain communications “authorized” by a candidate or
his political committee clearly identify the candidate or committee
or, if not so authorized, identify the payor and announce the lack
of authorization. 2 U. S. C. A. §441d (main ed. and
Supp. 2003). BCRA §311 makes several amendments to FECA
§318, among them the expansion of this identification regime
to include disbursements for “electioneering
communications” as defined in BCRA §201.
   The McConnell and Chamber of
Commerce plaintiffs challenge BCRA §311 by simply noting that
§311, along with all of the “electioneering
communications” provisions of BCRA, is unconstitutional. We
disagree. We think BCRA §311’s inclusion of
electioneering communications in the FECA §318 disclosure
regime bears a sufficient relationship to the important
governmental interest of “shed[ding] the light of
publicity” on campaign financing. Buckley, 424 U. S., at
81. Assuming as we must that FECA §318 is valid to begin with,
and that FECA §318 is valid as amended by BCRA
§311’s amendments other than the inclusion of
electioneering communications, the challenged inclusion of
electioneering communications is not itself unconstitutional. We
affirm the District Court’s decision upholding
§311’s expansion of FECA §318(a) to include
disclosure of disbursements for electioneering communications.

															BCRA §318
   BCRA §318, which adds
FECA §324, prohibits individuals “17 years old or
younger” from making contributions to candidates and
contributions or donations to political parties. 2 U.
S. C. A. §441k (Supp. 2003). The McConnell and
Echols plaintiffs challenge the provision; they argue that
§318 violates the First Amendment rights of minors. We
agree.
   Minors enjoy the protection
of the First Amendment. See, e.g., Tinker v. Des
Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503,
511–513 (1969). Limitations on the amount that an individual
may contribute to a candidate or political committee impinge on the
protected freedoms of expression and association. See Buckley,
supra, at 20–22. When the Government burdens the right
to contribute, we apply heightened scrutiny. See ante, at
25–26 (joint opinion of Stevens and O’Connor, JJ.)
(“[A] contribution limit involving even ‘significant
interference’ with associational rights is nevertheless valid
if it satisfies the ‘lesser demand’ of being
‘closely drawn’ to match a ‘sufficiently
important interest.’ ” (quoting Federal
Election Comm’n v. Beaumont, 539 U. S. ___, ___
(2003) (slip op., at 15)). We ask whether there is a
“sufficiently important interest” and whether the
statute is “closely drawn” to avoid unnecessary
abridgment of First Amendment freedoms. Ante, at
25–26; Buckley, 424 U. S., at 25. The Government
asserts that the provision protects against corruption by conduit;
that is, donations by parents through their minor children to
circumvent contribution limits applicable to the parents. But the
Government offers scant evidence of this form of evasion.[Footnote 3] Perhaps the
Government’s slim evidence results from sufficient deterrence
of such activities by §320 of FECA, which prohibits any person
from “mak[ing] a contribution in the name of another
person” or “knowingly accept[ing] a contribution made
by one person in the name of another,” 2 U. S. C.
§441f. Absent a more convincing case of the claimed evil, this
interest is simply too attenuated for §318 to withstand
heightened scrutiny. See Nixon v. Shrink Missouri
Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 391
(2000) (“The quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy
heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up
or down with the novelty and plausibility of the justification
raised”).

															   Even assuming, arguendo, the
Government advances an important interest, the provision is
overinclusive. The States have adopted a variety of more tailored
approaches—e.g., counting contributions by minors
against the total permitted for a parent or family unit, imposing a
lower cap on contributions by minors, and prohibiting contributions
by very young children. Without deciding whether any of these
alternatives is sufficiently tailored, we hold that the provision
here sweeps too broadly. We therefore affirm the District
Court’s decision striking down §318 as
unconstitutional.

															BCRA §403(b)
   The National Right to Life
plaintiffs argue that the District Court’s grant of
intervention to the intervenor-defendants, pursuant to Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 24(a) and BCRA §403(b), must be reversed
because the intervenor-defendants lack Article III standing. It is
clear, however, that the Federal Election Commission (FEC) has
standing, and therefore we need not address the standing of the
intervenor-defendants, whose position here is identical to the
FEC’s. See, e.g., Clinton v. City of New
York, 524 U. S.
417, 431–432, n. 19 (1998); Bowsher v.
Synar, 478 U. S. 714, 721
(1986). Cf. Diamond v. Charles, 476 U. S. 54,
68–69, n. 21 (1986) (reserving the question for another
day).

															   For the foregoing reasons, we
affirm the District Court’s judgment finding the
plaintiffs’ challenges to BCRA §305, §307, and the
millionaire provisions nonjusticiable, striking down as
unconstitutional BCRA §318, and upholding BCRA §311. The
judgment of the District Court is

															Affirmed.

															* Justice O’Connor, Justice Scalia,
Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter join this opinion in its
entirety. Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer
join this opinion, except with respect to BCRA §305. Justice
Thomas joins this opinion with respect to BCRA §§304,
305, 307, 316, 319, and 403(b).
Footnote 1

															 To qualify for increased candidate
contribution limits, the “opposition personal funds
amount,” which depends on expenditures by a candidate and her
self-financed opponent, must exceed a “threshold
amount.” 2 U. S. C. A. §§441a(i)(1)(D),
441a–1(a)(2)(A) (Supp. 2003).
Footnote 2

															 If the “opposition personal funds
amount” is at least 10 times the “threshold
amount” in a Senate race, or exceeds $350,000 in a House of
Representatives race, the coordinated party expenditure limits do
not apply. §§441a(i)(1)(C)(iii),
441a–1(a)(1)(C).
Footnote 3

															 Although some examples were presented to the
District Court, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 588–590 (2003)
(Kollar-Kotelly, J.), none were offered to this Court.
