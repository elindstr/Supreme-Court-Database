															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. JOHN
DENNISAPEL

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[February 26, 2014]

															

															     Justice Alito,
concurring.

															     The Ninth Circuit did
not rule on the constitutionality of 18 U. S. C.
§1382, and I see no reason to express any view on that
question at this time. See FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,
556 U. S. 502, 529 (2009) . “ This
Court . . . is one of final review, ‘not of
first view.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Cutter v. Wilkinson,
544 U. S. 709 , n. 7 (2005)). Our failure to address this
question should not be interpreted to signify either agreement or
disagreement with the arguments outlined in Justice
Ginsburg’s concurrence.
