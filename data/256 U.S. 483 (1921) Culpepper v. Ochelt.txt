															The case is stated in the opinion.

															MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.

															This case is in all material respects like McLaren v. Fleischer, ante, 256 U. S. 477.  It was decided in the same way by the state courts, and was argued with that case here.  Therefore the opinion in that will suffice to dispose of this.
