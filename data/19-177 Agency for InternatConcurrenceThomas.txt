															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT,  et al., PETITIONERS v. ALLIANCE FOR OPEN SOCIETY INTERNATIONAL, INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

															[June 29, 2020]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I agree with the Court that the Policy Requirement does not violate the
 
First Amendment as applied to respondents’ foreign affiliates, and I agree that nothing about this Court’s decision in Agency for Int’l Development v. Alliance for Open Society Int’l, Inc.,

570 U.S. 205 (2013) (AOSI I), suggests otherwise.  See ante, at 8–9.  I write separately to note my continued disagreement with AOSI I and to explain that the Policy Requirement does not violate the
 
First Amendment for a far simpler reason: It does not compel anyone to say anything.

															In AOSI I, the Court erred by holding that the Policy Requirement violated respondents’
 
First Amendment rights by conditioning their receipt of Leadership Act[1] funds on the affirmation of certain program objectives.  “The
 
First Amendment does not mandate a viewpoint-neutral government.”  AOSI I, 570 U. S., at 221 (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., dissenting).  Thus, the Government may require those who seek to carry out federally funded programs to support the Government’s objectives with regard to those programs.  Ibid.  After all, the Constitution itself “impos[es] affirmative ideological commitments prerequisite to assisting in the government’s work.”  Id., at 227.  It excludes viewpoints such as communism and anarchism, stating that those engaged in government work must swear an oath to support our Constitution’s republican form of government.  See Art. VI, cl. 3.

															Moreover, the mere conditioning of funds on “ ‘the affirmation of a belief’ ” tied to the purpose of a government program involves “no compulsion at all.”  AOSI I, 570 U. S., at 226 (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., dissenting).  Such a condition is “the reasonable price of admission to a limited government-spending program that each organization remains free to accept or reject.”  Ibid.  Just as respondents are not compelled to associate with their foreign affiliates, see ante, at 6–8, they are not compelled to participate in the Leadership Act program.

															The Policy Requirement does not violate the
 
First Amendment, regardless of whether it is applied to respondents, respondents’ legally distinct foreign affiliates, or any other organization, foreign or domestic.  Because the Court properly rejects respondents’ attempt to extend our erroneous precedent, I join its opinion in full.

 As the Court explains, the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Leadership Act),

22 U. S. C. §7601 et seq., “allocate[s] billions of dollars to American and foreign nongovernmental organizations that combat HIV/AIDS abroad.”  Ante, at 1.
