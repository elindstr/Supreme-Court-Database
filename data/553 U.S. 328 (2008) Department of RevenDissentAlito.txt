NO. 06-666





															DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF KENTUCKY, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. GEORGE W. DAVIS et ux.

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of
kentucky

															[May 19, 2008]



															   Justice Alito, dissenting.

															
   I proceed in this case, as I did in United Haulers Assn., Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (dissenting opinion), on the assumption that the Court’s established dormant Commerce Clause precedents should be followed, and on that assumption, I entirely agree with and join Justice Kennedy’s dissent.
