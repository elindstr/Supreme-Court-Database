															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
															_________________
															No. 13–9972
															_________________
															DENNYS RODRIGUEZ, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
															[April 21, 2015]
															                    Justice Kennedy, dissenting.
															                    My join in Justice Thomas’ dissenting opinion does not extend to Part III.  Although the issue discussed in that Part was argued here, the Court of Appeals has not addressed that aspect of the case in any detail.  In my view the better course would be to allow that court to do so in the first instance.
