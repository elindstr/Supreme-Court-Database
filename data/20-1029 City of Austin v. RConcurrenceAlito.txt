															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															City of Austin, Texas, PETITIONER v. Reagan National Advertising  of Austin, LLC, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[April 21, 2022]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

															I agree with the majority that we must reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals holding that the provisions of the Austin City Code regulating on- and off-premises signs are facially unconstitutional.  Ante, at 6.  The Court of Appeals reasoned that those provisions impose content-based restrictions and that they cannot satisfy strict scrutiny, but the Court of Appeals did not apply the tests that must be met before a law is held to be facially unconstitutional.  “Normally, a plaintiff bringing a facial challenge must ‘establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid,’ or show that the law lacks ‘a plainly legitimate sweep.’ ”  Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Bonta, 594 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 15) (citation omitted).  A somewhat less demanding test applies when a law affects freedom of speech.  Under our
 
First Amendment “overbreadth” doctrine, a law restricting speech is unconstitutional “if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.”  United States v. Stevens,

559 U.S. 460, 473 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).

															In this case, the Court of Appeals did not apply either of those tests, and it is doubtful that they can be met.  Many (and possibly the great majority) of the situations in which the relevant provisions may apply involve commercial speech, and under our precedents, regulations of commercial speech are analyzed differently.  See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.,

564 U.S. 552, 571–572 (2011).

															It is also questionable whether those code provisions are unconstitutional as applied to most of respondents’ billboards.  It appears that most if not all of those billboards are located off-premises in both the usual sense of that term,[1] and in the sense in which the term is used in the Austin code.  See Austin, Tex., City Code §25–10–3(11) (2016) (a sign is off-premises if it “advertis[es] a business, person, activity, goods, products, or services not located on the site where the sign is installed” or if it “directs persons to any location not on that site”).  The record contains photos of some of these billboards, see App. 130–147, and all but one appears to be located on otherwise vacant land.  Thus, they are clearly off-premises signs, and because they were erected before the enactment of the code provisions at issue, the only relevant restriction they face is that they cannot be digitized.[2]  The distinction between a digitized and non-digitized sign is not based on content, topic, or subject matter.  Even if the message on a billboard were written in a secret code, an observer would have no trouble determining whether it had been digitized.

															Because the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the code provisions are facially unconstitutional, I agree that we should reverse that decision.  On remand, the lower courts should determine whether those provisions are unconstitutional as applied to each of the billboards at issue.

															Today’s decision, however, goes further and holds flatly that “[t]he sign code provisions challenged here do not discriminate” on the basis of “ ‘the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed,’ ” ante, at 10, and that categorical statement is incorrect.  The provisions defining on- and off-premises signs clearly discriminate on those grounds, and at least as applied in some situations, strict scrutiny should be required.

															As the Court notes, under the provisions in effect when petitioner’s applications were denied, a sign was considered to be off-premises if it “advertis[ed],” among other things, a “person, activity, . . . or servic[e] not located on the site where the sign is installed” or if it “direct[ed] persons to any location not on that site.”  Austin, Tex., City Code §25–10–3(11).  Consider what this definition would mean as applied to signs posted in the front window of a commercial establishment, say, a little coffee shop.  If the owner put up a sign advertising a new coffee drink, the sign would be classified as on-premises, but suppose the owner instead mounted a sign in the same location saying: “Contribute to X’s legal defense fund” or “Free COVID tests available at Y pharmacy” or “Attend City Council meeting to speak up about Z.”  All those signs would appear to fall within the definition of an off-premises sign and would thus be disallowed.  See also post, at 3–4 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Providing disparate treatment for the sign about a new drink and the signs about social and political matters constitutes discrimination on the basis of topic or subject matter.  The code provisions adopted in 2017 are worded differently, but the new wording may not rule out similar results.[3]

															For these reasons, I would simply hold that the provisions at issue are not facially unconstitutional, and I would refrain from making any broader pronouncements.
Notes
1
 In ordinary usage, a sign that is attached to or located in close proximity to a building is not described as located “off-premises.”  The distinction between on- and off-premises signs is based solely on location, and that is why such a classification is not content-based.  See Reed v. Town of Gilbert,

576 U.S. 155, 175 (2015) (Alito, J., concurring). 

2
 A grandfathered sign can be maintained at its existing location, but the owner cannot “increase the degree of the existing nonconformity,” “change the method or technology used to convey a message,” or “increase the illumination of the sign.”  Austin, Tex., City Code §§25–10–152(A)–(B). 

3
 The amended code now defines “off-premise[s] sign” as “a sign that displays any message directing attention to a business, product, service, profession, commodity, activity, event, person, institution, or other commercial message which is generally conducted, sold, manufactured, produced, offered, or occurs elsewhere than on the premises where the sign is located,” and defines an “on-premise[s] sign” as “a sign that is not an off-premise[s] sign.”  Austin, Tex., City Code §§25–10–4(9)–(10) (2021).  It is not clear that the inclusion of “other commercial message” modifies the terms “activity,” “event,” “person,” or “institution” such that the provision would not draw topic-based distinctions as applied to non-commercial speech.
