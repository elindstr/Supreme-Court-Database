															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 20, 2019]

															Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

															The Establishment Clause states that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.”  U. S. Const., Amdt. 1.  The text and history of this Clause suggest that it should not be incorporated against the States.  Even if the Clause expresses an individual right enforceable against the States, it is limited by its text to “law[s]” enacted by a legislature, so it is unclear whether the Bladensburg Cross would implicate any incorporated right.  And even if it did, this religious display does not involve the type of actual legal coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion.  Therefore, the Cross is clearly constitutional.

															I

															As I have explained elsewhere, the Establishment Clause resists incorporation against the States.  Town of Greece v. Galloway,

572 U.S. 565, 604–607 (2014) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow,

542 U.S. 1, 49–51 (2004) (opinion concurring in judgment); Van Orden v. Perry,

545 U.S. 677, 692–693 (2005) (concurring opinion); Zelman v. Simmons-Harris,

536 U.S. 639, 677–680 (2002) (same).  In Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,

330 U.S. 1, 15 (1947), the Court “casually” incorporated the Clause with a declaration that because the Free Exercise Clause had been incorporated, “ ‘[t]here is every reason to give the same application and broad interpretation to the “establishment of religion” clause.’ ”  Town of Greece, 572 U. S., at 607, n. 1 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  The Court apparently did not consider that an incorporated Establishment Clause would prohibit exactly what the text of the Clause seeks to protect: state establishments of religion.  See id., at 605–606.

															The Court’s “inattention” to the significant question of incorporation “might be explained, although not excused, by the rise of popular conceptions about ‘separation of church and state’ as an ‘American’ constitutional right.”  Id., at 608, n. 1; see P. Hamburger, Separation of Church and State 454–463 (2002); see also id., at 391–454 (tracing the role of nativist sentiment in the rise of “the modern myth of separation” as an American ideal).  But an ahistorical generalization is no substitute for careful constitutional analysis.  We should consider whether any longstanding right of citizenship restrains the States in the establishment context.  See generally McDonald v. Chicago,

561 U.S. 742, 805–858, and n. 20 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

															Further confounding the incorporation question is the fact that the
 
First Amendment by its terms applies only to “law[s]” enacted by “Congress.”  Obviously, a memorial is not a law.  And respondents have not identified any speci- fic law they challenge as unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied.  Thus, respondents could prevail on their establishment claim only if the prohibition embodied in the Establishment Clause was understood to be an individual right of citizenship that applied to more than just “law[s]” “ma[de]” by “Congress.”[1]

															II

															Even if the Clause applied to state and local governments in some fashion, “[t]he mere presence of the monument along [respondents’] path involves no coercion and thus does not violate the Establishment Clause.”  Van Orden, 545 U. S., at 694 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  The sine qua non of an establishment of religion is “ ‘actual legal coercion.’ ”  Id., at 693.  At the founding, “[t]he coercion that was a hallmark of historical establishments of religion was coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial support by force of law and threat of penalty.”  Lee v. Weisman,

505 U.S. 577, 640 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted).  “In a typical case, attendance at the established church was mandatory, and taxes were levied to generate church revenue.  Dissenting ministers were barred from preaching, and political participation was limited to members of the established church.”  Town of Greece, supra, at 608 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (citation omitted).  In an action claiming an unconstitutional establishment of religion, the plaintiff must demonstrate that he was actually coerced by government conduct that shares the characteristics of an establishment as understood at the founding.[2]

															Here, respondents briefly suggest that the government’s spending their tax dollars on maintaining the Bladensburg Cross represents coercion, but they have not demonstrated that maintaining a religious display on public property shares any of the historical characteristics of an establishment of religion.  The local commission has not attempted to control religious doctrine or personnel, compel religious observance, single out a particular religious denomination for exclusive state subsidization, or punish dissenting worship.  Instead, the commission has done something that the founding generation, as well as the generation that ratified the
 
Fourteenth Amendment, would have found commonplace: displaying a religious symbol on government property.  See Brief for Becket Fund for Religious Liberty as Amicus Curiae 14–22.  Lacking any characteristics of “the coercive state establishments that existed at the founding,” Town of Greece, 572 U. S., at 608 (opinion of Thomas, J.), the Bladensburg Cross is constitutional.

															The Bladensburg Cross is constitutional even though the cross has religious significance as a central symbol of Christianity.  Respondents’ primary contention is that this characteristic of the Cross makes it “sectarian”—a word used in respondents’ brief more than 40 times.  Putting aside the fact that Christianity is not a “sect,” religious displays or speech need not be limited to that which a “judge considers to be nonsectarian.”  Id., at 582 (majority opinion).  As the Court has explained, “[a]n insistence on nonsectarian” religious speech is inconsistent with our Nation’s history and traditions.  Id., at 578–580; see id., at 595 (Alito, J., concurring).  Moreover, requiring that religious expressions be nonsectarian would force the courts “to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech.”  Id., at 581 (majority opinion).  Any such effort would find courts “trolling through . . . religious beliefs” to decide what speech is sufficiently generic.  Mitchell v. Helms,

530 U.S. 793, 828 (2000) (plurality opinion).  And government bodies trying to comply with the inevitably arbitrary decisions of the courts would face similarly intractable questions.  See Town of Greece, supra, at 596 (opinion of Alito, J.).[3]

															III

															As to the long-discredited test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman,

403 U.S. 602, 612–613 (1971), and reiterated in County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,

492 U.S. 573, 592–594 (1989), the plurality rightly rejects its relevance to claims, like this one, involving “religious references or imagery in public monuments, symbols, mottos, displays, and ceremonies.”  Ante, at 15–16, and n. 16.  I agree with that aspect of its opinion.  I would take the logical next step and overrule the Lemon test in all contexts.  First, that test has no basis in the original meaning of the Constitution.  Second, “since its inception,” it has “been manipu- lated to fit whatever result the Court aimed to achieve.”  McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky.,

545 U.S. 844, 900 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting); see Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.,

508 U.S. 384, 398–399 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Third, it continues to cause enormous confusion in the States and the lower courts.  See generally Utah Highway Patrol Assn. v. American Atheists, Inc.,

565 U.S. 994 (2011) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  In recent decades, the Court has tellingly refused to apply Lemon in the very cases where it purports to be most useful.  See Utah Highway, supra, at 997–998 (collecting cases); ante, at 13 (plurality opinion) (same).  The obvious explanation is that Lemon does not provide a sound basis for judging Establishment Clause claims.  However, the court below “s[aw] fit to apply Lemon.”  874 F.3d 195, 205 (CA4 2017).  It is our job to say what the law is, and because the Lemon test is not good law, we ought to say so.

															*  *  *

															Regrettably, I cannot join the Court’s opinion because it does not adequately clarify the appropriate standard for Establishment Clause cases.  Therefore, I concur only in the judgment.
Notes
1
 In my view, the original meaning of the phrase “Congress shall make no law” is a question worth exploring.  Compare G. Lawson & G. Seidman, The Constitution of Empire 42 (2004) (arguing that the
 
First Amendment “applies only to Congress”), with Shrum v. Coweta, 449 F.3d 1132, 1140–1143 (CA10 2006) (McConnell, J.) (arguing that it is not so limited).   

2
 Of course, cases involving state or local action are not strictly speaking Establishment Clause cases, but instead
 
Fourteenth Amendment cases about a privilege or immunity of citizenship.  It is conceivable that the salient characteristics of an establishment changed by the time of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment, see Town of Greece v. Galloway,

572 U.S. 565, 607, 609–610 (2014) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but respondents have presented no evidence suggesting so.

 Another reason to avoid a constitutional test that turns on the “sectarian” nature of religious speech is that the Court has suggested “formally dispens[ing]” with this factor in related contexts.  Mitchell, 530 U. S., at 826 (plurality opinion).  Among other reasons, the “sectarian” test “has a shameful pedigree” that originated during the 1870s when Congress considered the Blaine Amendment, “which would have amended the Constitution to bar any aid to sectarian institutions.”  Id., at 828.  “Consideration of the amendment arose at a time of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general, and it was an open secret that ‘sectarian’ was code for ‘Catholic.’ ”  Ibid.  This anti-Catholic hostility may well have played a role in the Court’s later decisions.  Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,

330 U.S. 1 (1947), for example, was written by Justice Black, who would later accuse Catholics who advocated for textbook loans to religious schools of being “powerful sectarian religious propagandists . . . looking toward complete domination and supremacy of their particular brand of religion.”  Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen,

392 U.S. 236, 251 (1968) (Black, J., dissenting).  Even by the time of Lemon v. Kurtzman,

403 U.S. 602 (1971), some Justices were still “influenced by residual anti-Catholicism and by a deep suspicion of Catholic schools.”  Laycock, The Underlying Unity of Separation and Neutrality, 46 Emory L. J. 43, 58 (1997).  Indeed, the Court’s opinion in Lemon “relied on what it considered to be inherent risks in religious schools despite the absence of a record in Lemon itself and despite contrary fact-finding by the district court in the companion case.”  Laycock, supra, at 58 (footnote omitted); see generally W. Ball, Mere Creatures of the State?, 35–40 (1994).  And in his concurring opinion, Justice Douglas (joined by Justice Black) repeatedly quoted an anti-Catholic book, including for the proposition that, in Catholic parochial schools, “ ‘[t]he whole education of the child is filled with propaganda.’ ”  403 U. S., at 635, n. 20 (quoting L. Boettner, Roman Catholicism 360 (1962)); see 403 U. S., at 636 (similar).  The tract said that Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin learned the “secret[s] of [their] success” in indoctrination from the Catholic Church, and that “an undue proportion of the gangsters, racketeers, thieves, and juvenile delinquents who roam our big city streets come . . . from the [Catholic] parochial schools,” where children are taught by “brain-washed,” “ ‘ignorant European peasants.’ ”  Boettner, supra, at 363, 370–372.
