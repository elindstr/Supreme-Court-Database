SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 06-6330

															DERRICK KIMBROUGH, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the fourth circuit

															[December 10, 2007]

															   Justice Alito, dissenting.

															   For the reasons explained in my
dissent in Gall v. United States, ante,
p. ___, I would hold that, under the remedial decision in
United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220,
258–265 (2005), a district judge is still required to give
significant weight to the policy decisions embodied in the
Guidelines. The Booker remedial decision, however, does
not permit a court of appeals to treat the Guidelines’ policy
decisions as binding. I would not draw a distinction between the
Guideline at issue here and other Guidelines. Accordingly, I would
vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for
reconsideration.
