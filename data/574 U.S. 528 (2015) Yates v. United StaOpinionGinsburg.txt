															JOHN L. YATES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the eleventh circuit

															[February 25, 2015]

															Justice Ginsburg announced the judgment of the Court and
delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice, Justice Breyer,
and Justice Sotomayor join.

															John Yates, a commercial fisherman, caught undersized red
grouper in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. To prevent federal
authorities from confirming that he had harvested undersized fish,
Yates ordered a crew member to toss the suspect catch into the sea.
For this offense, he was charged with, and convicted of,
violating18 U.Â S.Â C. Â§1519,
which provides:

															â€œWhoever knowingly alters, destroys,
mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry
in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to
impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper
administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any
department or agency of the United States or any case filed under
title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or
case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20
years, or both.â€

															Yates was also indicted and convicted under
Â§2232(a), which provides:

															â€œDestruction or Removal of Property to
Prevent Seizure.â€”Whoever, before, during, or
after any search for or seizure of property by any person
authorized to make such search or seizure, knowingly destroys,
damages, wastes, disposes of, transfers, or otherwise takes any
action, or knowingly attempts to destroy, damage, waste, dispose
of, transfer, or otherwise take any action, for the purpose of
preventing or impairing the Governmentâ€™s lawful
authority to take such property into its custody or control or to
continue holding such property under its lawful custody and
control, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more
than 5 years, or both.â€

															Yates does not contest his conviction for violating
Â§2232(a), but he maintains that fish are not
trappedwithin the term â€œtangible
object,â€ as that term is used in Â§1519.

															Section 1519 was enacted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002,116Stat.745, legislation designed to protect investors and
restore trust in financial markets following the collapse of Enron
Corporation. A fish is no doubt an object that is tangible; fish
can be seen, caught, andhandled, and a catch, as this case
illustrates, is vulnerable to destruction. But it would cut
Â§1519 loose from itsfinancial-fraud mooring to hold
that it encompasses any and all objects, whatever their size or
significance, destroyed with obstructive intent. Mindful that in
Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress trained its attention on corporate and
accounting deception and cover-ups, we conclude that a matching
construction of Â§1519 is in order: A tangible object
captured by Â§1519, we hold, must be one used to record
or preserve information.

															I

															On August 23, 2007, the Miss Katie, a commercial fishing
boat, was six days into an expedition in the Gulf of Mexico. Her
crew numbered three, including Yates, the captain. Engaged in a
routine offshore patrol to inspect both recreational and commercial
vessels, Officer John Jones of the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission decided to board the Miss Katie to
check on the vesselâ€™s compliance with fishing
rules. Although the Miss Katie was far enough from the
Florida coast to be in exclusively federal waters, she was
nevertheless within Officer Jonesâ€™s
jurisdiction. Because he had been deputized as a federal agent by
the National Marine Fisheries Service, Officer Jones had authority
to enforce federal, as well as state, fishing laws.

															Upon boarding the Miss Katie, Officer Jones noticed three
red grouper that appeared to be undersized hanging from a hook on
the deck. At the time, federal conservation regulations required
immediate release of red grouper less than 20 inches long. 50 CFR
Â§622.37(d)(2)(ii) (effective April 2, 2007). Violation
of those regulations is a civil offense punishable by a fine or
fishing license suspension. See 16 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§Â§1857(1)(A), (G), 1858(a), (g).

															Suspecting that other undersized fish might be on board, Officer
Jones proceeded to inspect the shipâ€™s catch,
setting aside and measuring only fish that appeared to him to be
shorter than 20 inches. Officer Jones ultimately determined that 72
fish fell short of the 20inch mark. A fellow officer recorded the
length of each of the undersized fish on a catch measurement
verification form. With few exceptions, the measured fish were
between 19 and 20 inches; three were less than 19 inches; none were
less than 18.75 inches. After separating the fish measuring below
20 inches from the rest of the catch by placing them in wooden
crates, Officer Jones directed Yates to leave the fish, thus
segregated, in the crates until the Miss Katie returned to
port. Before departing, Officer Jones issued Yates a citation for
possession of undersized fish.

															Four days later, after the Miss Katie had docked in
Cortez, Florida, Officer Jones measured the fish contained in the
wooden crates. This time, however, the measured fish, although
still less than 20 inches, slightly exceeded the lengths recorded
on board. Jones surmised that the fish brought to port were not the
same as those he had detected during his initial inspection. Under
questioning, one of the crew members admitted that, at
Yatesâ€™s direction, he had thrown overboard the
fish Officer Jones had measured at sea, and that he and Yates had
replaced the tossed grouper with fish from the rest of the
catch.

															For reasons not disclosed in the record before us, more than 32
months passed before criminal charges were lodged against Yates. On
May 5, 2010, he was indicted for destroying property to prevent a
federal seizure, in violation of Â§2232(a), and for
destroying, concealing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a
federal investigation, in violation of Â§1519.[1] By the time of the indictment, the minimum legal
length for Gulf red grouper had been lowered from 20 inches to 18
inches. See 50 CFR Â§622.37(d)(2)(iv) (effective May 18,
2009). No measured fish in Yatesâ€™s catch fell
below that limit. The record does not reveal what civil penalty, if
any, Yates received for his possession of fish undersized under the
2007 regulation. See16 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§1858(a).

															Yates was tried on the criminal charges in August 2011. At the
end of the Governmentâ€™s case in chief, he moved
for a judgment of acquittal on the Â§1519 charge.
Pointing to Â§1519â€™s title and its
origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Yates argued that
the section sets forth â€œa documents
offenseâ€ and that its reference to
â€œtangible object[s]â€ subsumes
â€œcomputer hard drives, logbooks, [and] things of
that nature,â€ not fish. App. 91â€“92.
Yates acknowledged that the Criminal Code contains
â€œsections that would have been appropriate for
the [G]overnment to pursueâ€ if it wished to prosecute
him for tampering with evidence. App. 91. Section 2232(a), set out
supra, at 1â€“2, fit that description. But
Â§1519, Yates insisted, did not.

															The Government countered that a â€œtangible
objectâ€ within Â§1519â€™s
compass is â€œsimply something other than a
document or record.â€ App. 93. The trial judge expressed
misgivings about reading â€œtangible
objectâ€ as broadly as the Government urged:
â€œIsnâ€™t there a Latin phrase
[about] construction of a statute .Â .Â . .
The gist of it is .Â .Â . you take a look at
[a] line of words, and you interpret the words consistently. So if
youâ€™re talking about documents, and records,
tangible objects are tangible objects in the nature of a document
or a record, as opposed to a fish.â€ Ibid. The
first-instance judge nonetheless followed controlling Eleventh
Circuit precedent. While recognizing that Â§1519 was
passed as part of legislation targeting corporate fraud, the Court
of Appeals had instructed that â€œthe broad
language of Â§1519 is not limited to corporate fraud
cases, and â€˜Congress is free to pass laws with
language covering areas well beyond the particular crisis du
jour that initially prompted legislative
action.â€™Â â€ No.
2:10â€“crâ€“66â€“FtMâ€“29SPC
(MD Fla., Aug. 8, 2011), App. 116 (quoting United States v.
Hunt, 526 F.Â 3d 739, 744 (CA11 2008)).
Accordingly, the trial court read â€œtangible
objectâ€ as a term
â€œindependentâ€ of
â€œrecordâ€ or
â€œdocument.â€ App. 116. For violating
Â§1519 and Â§2232(a), the court sentenced
Yates to imprisonment for 30 days, followed by supervised release
for three years. App. 118â€“120. For life, he will
bear the stigma of having a federal felony conviction.

															On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit found the text of
Â§1519 â€œplain.â€ 733
F.Â 3d 1059, 1064 (2013). Because
â€œtangible objectâ€ was
â€œundefinedâ€ in the statute, the
Court of Appeals gave the term its â€œordinary or
natural meaning,â€ i.e., its dictionary
definition, â€œ[h]aving or possessing physical
form.â€ Ibid. (quoting Blackâ€™s
Law Dictionary 1592 (9th ed. 2009)).

															We granted certiorari, 572 U.Â S. ___ (2014), and now
reverse the Eleventh Circuitâ€™s judgment.

															II

															The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure
of Enronâ€™s massive accounting fraud and
revelations that the companyâ€™s outside auditor,
Arthur Andersen LLP, had systematically destroyed potentially
incriminating documents. The Government acknowledges that
Â§1519 was intended to prohibit, in particular,
corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial
wrong-doing. Brief for United States 46. Prior law made it an
offense to â€œintimidat[e], threate[n], or
corruptly persuad[e] another personâ€ to shred
documents. Â§1512(b) (emphasis added). Section 1519
cured a conspicuous omission by imposing liability on a person who
destroys records himself. See S.Â Rep. No.
107â€“146, p. 14 (2002) (describing
Â§1519 as â€œa new general anti
shredding provisionâ€ and explaining that
â€œcertain current provisions make it a crime to
persuade another person to destroy documents, but not a crime to
actually destroy the same documents yourselfâ€). The new
section also expanded prior law by including within the
provisionâ€™s reach â€œany matter
within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United
States.â€ Id., at 14â€“15.

															In the Governmentâ€™s view, Â§1519
extends beyond the principal evil motivating its passage. The words
of Â§1519, the Government argues, support reading the
provision as a general ban on the spoliation of evidence, covering
all physical items that might be relevant to any matter under
federal investigation.

															Yates urges a contextual reading of Â§1519, tying
â€œtangible objectâ€ to the surrounding
words, the placement of the provision within the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, and related provisions enacted at the same time, in particular
Â§1520 and Â§1512(c)(1), see infra, at
10, 12â€“13. Section 1519, he maintains, targets
not all manner of evidence, but records, documents, and tangible
objects used to preserve them, e.g., computers, servers, and
other media on which information is stored.

															We agree with Yates and reject the
Governmentâ€™s unrestrained reading.
â€œTangible objectâ€ in
Â§1519, we conclude, is better read to cover only
objects one can use to record or preserve information, not all
objects in the physical world.

															A

															The ordinary meaning of an
â€œobjectâ€ that is
â€œtangible,â€ as stated in dictionary
definitions, is â€œa discrete
.Â .Â . thing,â€
Websterâ€™s Third New International Dictionary
1555 (2002), that â€œpossess[es] physical
form,â€ Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1683
(10th ed. 2014). From this premise, the Government concludes that
â€œtangible object,â€ as that term
appears in Â§1519, covers the waterfront, including fish
from the sea.

															Whether a statutory term is unambiguous, however, does not turn
solely on dictionary definitions of its component words. Rather,
â€œ[t]he plainness or ambiguity of statutory
language is determined [not only] by reference to the language
itself, [but as well by] the specific context in which that
language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a
whole.â€ Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,519
U.Â S. 337,341 (1997). See also Deal v. United
States,508 U.Â S. 129,132 (1993) (it is a
â€œfundamental principle of statutory construction
(and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot
be determined in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in
which it is usedâ€). Ordinarily, a
wordâ€™s usage accords with its dictionary
definition. In law as in life, however, the same words, placed in
different contexts, sometimes mean different things.

															We have several times affirmed that identical language may
convey varying content when used in different statutes, sometimes
even in different provisions of the same statute. See, e.g.,
FAA v. Cooper, 566 U.Â S. ___,
___â€“___ (2012), (slip op., at
6â€“7) (â€œactual
damagesâ€ has different meanings in different statutes);
Wachovia Bank, N.Â A. v. Schmidt,546
U.Â S. 303â€“314 (2006)
(â€œlocatedâ€ has different meanings in
different provisions of the National Bank Act); General Dynamics
Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,540 U.Â S.
581â€“597 (2004)
(â€œageâ€ has different meanings in
different provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of
1967); United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball
Co.,532 U.Â S. 200,213 (2001)
(â€œwages paidâ€ has different meanings
in different provisions of Title 26
U.Â S.Â C.); Robinson, 519
U.Â S., at 342â€“344
(â€œemployeeâ€ has different meanings
in different sections of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964); Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.
Thompson,478 U.Â S. 804â€“808
(1986) (â€œarising underâ€ has
different meanings in U.Â S. Const.,
Art.Â III, Â§2, and28
U.Â S.Â C. Â§1331); District of
Columbia v. Carter,409 U.Â S.
418â€“421 (1973) (â€œState or
Territoryâ€ has different meanings in42
U.Â S.Â C. Â§1982 and
Â§1983); Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v.
United States,286 U.Â S.
427â€“437 (1932) (â€œtrade or
commerceâ€ has different meanings in different sections
of the Sherman Act). As the Court observed in Atlantic Cleaners
& Dyers, 286 U.Â S., at 433:

															â€œMost words have different shades of meaning
and consequently may be variously construed
.Â .Â .Â . Where the subject
matter to which the words refer is not the same in the several
places where [the words] are used, or the conditions are different,
or the scope of the legislative power exercised in one case is
broader than that exercised in another, the meaning well may vary
to meet the purposes of the law, to be arrived at by a
consideration of the language in which those purposes are
expressed, and of the circumstances under which the language was
employed.â€[2]

															In short, although dictionary definitions of the words
â€œtangibleâ€ and
â€œobjectâ€ bear consideration, they
are not dispositive of the meaning of â€œtangible
objectâ€ in Â§1519.

															Supporting a reading of â€œtangible
object,â€ as used in Â§1519, in accord with
dictionary definitions, the Government points to the appearance of
that term in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16. That Rule
requires the prosecution to grant a defendantâ€™s
request to inspect â€œtangible
objectsâ€ within the Governmentâ€™s
control that have utility for the defense. See Fed. Rule Crim.
Proc. 16(a)(1)(E).

															Rule 16â€™s reference to
â€œtangible objectsâ€ has been
interpreted to include any physical evidence. See 5 W. LaFave, J.
Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure
Â§20.3(g), pp. 405â€“406, and
n.Â 120 (3d ed. 2007). Rule 16 is a discovery rule
designed to protect defendants by compelling the prosecution to
turn over to the defense evidence material to the charges at issue.
In that context, a comprehensive construction of
â€œtangible objectsâ€ is fitting. In
contrast, Â§1519 is a penal provision that refers to
â€œtangible objectâ€ not in relation to
a request for information relevant to a specific court proceeding,
but rather in relation to federal investigations or proceedings of
every kind, including those not yet begun.[3] See
Commissioner v. National Carbide Corp., 167
F.Â 2d 304, 306 (CA2 1948) (Hand, J.)
(â€œwords are chameleons, which reflect the color
of their environmentâ€). Just as the context of Rule 16
supports giving â€œtangible objectâ€ a
meaning as broad as its dictionary definition, the context of
Â§1519 tugs strongly in favor of a narrower reading.

															B

															Familiar interpretive guides aid our construction of the words
â€œtangible objectâ€ as they appear in
Â§1519.

															We note first Â§1519â€™s caption:
â€œDestruction, alteration, or falsification of
records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy.â€ That
heading conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spoliation
of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records.
Neither does the title of the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in
which Â§1519 was placed, Â§802:
â€œCriminal penalties for altering
documents.â€116Stat.800. Furthermore, Â§1520,
the only other provision passed as part of Â§802, is
titled â€œDestruction of corporate audit
recordsâ€ and addresses only that specific subset of
records and documents. While these headings are not commanding,
they supply cues that Congress did not intend
â€œtangible objectâ€ in
Â§1519 to sweep within its reach physical objects of
every kind, including things no one would describe as records,
documents, or devices closely associated with them.
SeeAlmendarez-Torres v. United States,523
U.Â S. 224,234 (1998) (â€œ[T]he title
of a statute and the heading of a section are tools available for
the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a
statute.â€ (internal quotation marks omitted)). If
Congress indeed meant to make Â§1519 an all-encompassing
ban on the spoliation of evidence, as the dissent believes Congress
did, one would have expected a clearer indication of that
intent.

															Section 1519â€™s position within Chapter 73 of
Title 18 further signals that Â§1519 was not intended to
serve as a cross-the-board ban on the destruction of physical
evidence of every kind. Congress placed Â§1519 (and its
companion provision Â§1520) at the end of the chapter,
following immediately after the pre-existing Â§1516,
Â§1517, and Â§1518, each of them prohibiting
obstructive acts in specific contexts. See Â§1516
(audits of recipients of federal funds); Â§1517 (federal
examinations of financial institutions); Â§1518
(criminal investigations of federal health care offenses). See also
S.Â Rep. No. 107â€“146,
atÂ 7 (observing that Â§1517 and
Â§1518 â€œapply to obstruction in
certain limited types of cases, such as bankruptcy fraud,
examinations of financial institutions, and healthcare
fraudâ€).

															But Congress did not direct codification of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Actâ€™s other additions to Chapter 73 adjacent to
these specialized provisions. Instead, Congress directed placement
of those additions within or alongside retained provisions that
address obstructive acts relating broadly to official proceedings
and criminal trials: Section 806, â€œCivil Action
to protect against retaliation in fraud cases,â€ was
codified as Â§1514A and inserted between the
pre-existing Â§1514, which addresses civil actions to
restrain harassment of victims and witnesses in criminal cases, and
Â§1515, which defines terms used in Â§1512
and Â§1513. Section 1102, â€œTampering
with a record or otherwise impeding an official
proceeding,â€ was codified as Â§1512(c) and
inserted within the pre-existing Â§1512, which addresses
tampering with a victim, witness, or informant to impede any
official proceeding. Section 1107, â€œRetaliation
against informants,â€ was codified as
Â§1513(e) and inserted within the pre-existing
Â§1513, which addresses retaliation against a victim,
witness, or informant in any official proceeding. Congress thus
ranked Â§1519, not among the broad proscriptions, but
together with specialized provisions expressly aimed at corporate
fraud and financial audits. This placement accords with the view
that Congressâ€™ conception of
Â§1519â€™s coverage was considerably
more limited than the Governmentâ€™s.[4]

															The contemporaneous passage of Â§1512(c)(1), which
was contained in a section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act discrete from
the section embracing Â§1519 and Â§1520, is
also instructive. Section 1512(c)(1) provides:

															â€œ(c) Whoever
corruptlyâ€”

															â€œ(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals
a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the
intent to impair the objectâ€™s integrity or
availability for use in an official proceeding

															
.â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ.â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ.â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ.â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ.

															â€œshall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.â€

															The legislative history reveals that Â§1512(c)(1) was
drafted and proposed after Â§1519. See 148 Cong. Rec.
12518, 13088â€“13089 (2002). The Government
argues, and Yates does not dispute, that
Â§1512(c)(1)â€™s reference to
â€œother objectâ€ includes any and
every physical object. But if
Â§1519â€™s reference to
â€œtangible objectâ€ already included
all physical objects, as the Government and the dissent contend,
then Congress had no reason to enact Â§1512(c)(1):
Virtually any act that would violate Â§1512(c)(1) no
doubt would violate Â§1519 as well, for
Â§1519 applies to â€œthe investigation
or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of
any department or agency of the United States . . . or in relation
to or contemplation of any such matter,â€ not just to
â€œan official proceeding.â€[5]

															The Government acknowledges that, under its reading,
Â§1519 and Â§1512(c)(1)
â€œsignificantly overlap.â€ Brief for
United States 49. Nowhere does the Government explain what
independent function Â§1512(c)(1) would serve if the
Government is right about the sweeping scope of Â§1519.
We resist a reading of Â§1519 that would render
superfluous an entire provision passed in proximity as part of the
same Act.[6] See Marx v. General
Revenue Corp., 568 U.Â S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op.,
at 14) (â€œ[T]he canon against surplusage is
strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another
part of the same statutory scheme.â€).

															The words immediately surrounding â€œtangible
objectâ€ in
Â§1519â€”â€œfalsifies,
or makes a false entry in any record [or]
documentâ€â€”also cabin the contextual
meaning of that term. As explained in Gustafson v. Alloyd
Co.,513 U.Â S. 561,575 (1995), we rely on the
principle of noscitur a sociisâ€”a word is
known by the company it keepsâ€”to
â€œavoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad
that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving
unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress.â€ (internal
quotation marks omitted). See also United States v.
Williams,553 U.Â S. 285,294 (2008)
(â€œa word is given more precise content by the
neighboring words with which it is associatedâ€). In
Gustafson, we interpreted the word
â€œcommunicationâ€ in
Â§2(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 to refer to a
public communication, rather than any communication, because the
word appeared in a list with other words, notably
â€œnotice, circular, [and]
advertisement,â€ making it â€œapparent
that the list refer[red] to documents of wide
dissemination.â€ 513 U.Â S., at
575â€“576. And we did so even though the list
began with the word â€œany.â€

															The noscitur a sociis canon operates in a similar manner
here. â€œTangible objectâ€ is the last
in a list of terms that begins â€œany record [or]
document.â€ The term is therefore appropriately read to
refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the subset
of tangible objects involving records and documents, i.e.,
objects used to record or preserve information. See United States
Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual Â§2J1.2,
comment., n.Â 1 (Nov. 2014)
(â€œÂ â€˜Records,
documents, or tangible objectsâ€™ includes (A)
records, documents, or tangible objects that are stored on, or that
are, magnetic, optical, digital, other electronic, or other storage
mediums or devices; and (B) wire or electronic
communications.â€).

															This moderate interpretation of â€œtangible
objectâ€ accords with the list of actions
Â§1519 proscribes. The section applies to anyone who
â€œalters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers
up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record,
document, or tangible objectâ€ with the requisite
obstructive intent. (Emphasis added.) The last two verbs,
â€œfalsif[y]â€ and
â€œmak[e] a false entry in,â€ typically
take as grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to
record or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives.
See, e.g., Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 720
(10th ed. 2014) (defining â€œfalsifyâ€
as â€œ[t]o make deceptive; to counterfeit, forge,
or misrepresent; esp., to tamper with (a document, record,
etc.)â€). It would be unnatural, for example, to
describe a killerâ€™s act of wiping his
fingerprints from a gun as
â€œfalsifyingâ€ the murder weapon. But
it would not be strange to refer to
â€œfalsifyingâ€ data stored on a hard
drive as simply â€œfalsifyingâ€ a hard
drive. Furthermore, Congress did not include on
Â§1512(c)(1)â€™s list of prohibited
actions â€œfalsifiesâ€ or
â€œmakes a false entry in.â€ See
Â§1512(c)(1) (making it unlawful to
â€œalte[r], destro[y], mutilat[e], or concea[l] a
record, document, or other objectâ€ with the requisite
obstructive intent). That contemporaneous omission also suggests
that Congress intended â€œtangible
objectâ€ in Â§1519 to have a narrower scope
than â€œother objectâ€ in
Â§1512(c)(1).[7]

															A canon related to noscitur a sociis, ejusdem
generis, counsels: â€œWhere general words
follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words
are [usually] construed to embrace only objects similar in nature
to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific
words.â€ Washington State Dept. of Social and Health
Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler,537
U.Â S. 371,384 (2003) (internal quotation marks
omitted). In Begay v. United States,553
U.Â S. 137â€“143 (2008), for example,
we relied on this principle to determine what crimes were covered
by the statutory phrase â€œany crime
.Â .Â . that .Â .Â . is
burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or
otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk
of physical injury to another,â€18
U.Â S.Â C. Â§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The
enumeration of specific crimes, we explained, indicates that the
â€œotherwise involvesâ€ provision
covers â€œonly similar crimes, rather than
every crime that â€˜presents a serious
potential risk of physical injury to
another.â€™Â â€ 553
U.Â S., at 142. Had Congress intended the latter
â€œall encompassingâ€ meaning, we
observed, â€œit is hard to see why it would have
needed to include the examples at all.â€ Ibid.
See also CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of
Revenue,562 U.Â S. 277, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16)
(â€œWe typically use ejusdem generis to
ensure that a general word will not render specific words
meaningless.â€). Just so here. Had Congress intended
â€œtangible objectâ€ in
Â§1519 to be interpreted so generically as to capture
physical objects as dissimilar as documents and fish, Congress
would have had no reason to refer specifically to
â€œrecordâ€ or
â€œdocument.â€ The
Governmentâ€™s unbounded reading of
â€œtangible objectâ€ would render those
words misleading surplusage.

															Having used traditional tools of statutory interpretation to
examine markers of congressional intent within the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act and Â§1519 itself, we are persuaded that an
aggressive interpretation of â€œtangible
objectâ€ must be rejected. It is highly improbable that
Congress would have buried a general spoliation statute covering
objects of any and every kind in a provision targeting fraud in
financial record-keeping.

															The Government argues, however, that our inquiry would be
incomplete if we failed to consider the origins of the phrase
â€œrecord, document, or tangible
object.â€ Congress drew that phrase, the Government
says, from a 1962 Model Penal Code (MPC) provision, and reform
proposals based on that provision. The MPC provision and proposals
prompted by it would have imposed liability on anyone who
â€œalters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, or
removes a record, document or thing.â€ See ALI, MPC
Â§241.7(1), p. 175 (1962). Those proscriptions were
understood to refer to all physical evidence. See MPC
Â§241.7, Comment 3, at 179 (1980) (provision
â€œapplies to any physical objectâ€).
Accordingly, the Government reasons, and the dissent exuberantly
agrees, post, at 4â€“5, Congress must have
intended Â§1519 to apply to the universe of physical
evidence.

															The inference is unwarranted. True, the 1962 MPC provision
prohibited tampering with any kind of physical evidence. But unlike
Â§1519, the MPC provision did not prohibit actions that
specifically relate to records, documents, and objects used to
record or preserve information. The MPC provision also ranked the
offense as a misdemeanor and limited liability to instances in
which the actor â€œbeliev[es] that an official
proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be
instituted.â€ MPC Â§241.7(1), at 175. Yates
would have had scant reason to anticipate a felony prosecution, and
certainly not one instituted at a time when even the smallest of
the fish he caught came within the legal limit. See supra,
at 4; cf. Bond v. United States, 572
U.Â S. ___, ___ (2014), (slip op., at 14) (rejecting
â€œboundless readingâ€ of a statutory
term given â€œdeeply serious
consequencesâ€ that reading would entail). A proposed
federal offense in line with the MPC provision, advanced by a
federal commission in 1971, was similarly qualified. See Final
Report of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal
Laws Â§1323, pp. 116â€“117 (1971).

															Section 1519 conspicuously lacks the limits built into the MPC
provision and the federal proposal. It describes not a misdemeanor,
but a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. And the
section covers conduct intended to impede any federal investigation
or proceeding, including one not even on the verge of commencement.
Given these significant differences, the meaning of
â€œrecord, document, or thingâ€ in the
MPC provision and a kindred proposal is not a reliable indicator of
the meaning Congress assigned to â€œrecord,
document, or tangible objectâ€ in Â§1519. The
MPC provision, in short, tells us neither â€œwhat
Congress wrote [nor] what Congress wanted,â€ cf.
post, at 15, concerning Yatesâ€™s small
fish as the subject of a federal felony prosecution.

															C

															Finally, if our recourse to traditional tools of statutory
construction leaves any doubt about the meaning of
â€œtangible object,â€ as that term is
used in Â§1519, we would invoke the rule that
â€œambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal
statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.â€
Cleveland v. United States,531 U.Â S.
12,25 (2000) (quoting Rewis v. United States,401
U.Â S. 808,812 (1971)). That interpretative principle is
relevant here, where the Government urges a reading of
Â§1519 that exposes individuals to 20-year prison
sentences for tampering with any physical object that
might have evidentiary value in any federal
investigation into any offense, no matter whether the
investigation is pending or merely contemplated, or whether the
offense subject to investigation is criminal or civil. See
Liparota v. United States,471 U.Â S.
419,427 (1985) (â€œApplication of the rule of
lenity ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair warning
concerning conduct rendered illegal and strikes the appropriate
balance between the legislature, the prosecutor, and the court in
defining criminal liability.â€). In determining the
meaning of â€œtangible objectâ€ in
Â§1519, â€œit is appropriate, before we
choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should
have spoken in language that is clear and definite.â€
See Cleveland, 531 U.Â S., at 25 (quoting
United States v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp.,344
U.Â S. 218,222 (1952)). See also Jones v.
United States,529 U.Â S.
848â€“859 (2000) (rule of lenity
â€œreinforcesâ€ the conclusion that
arson of an owner-occupied residence is not subject to federal
prosecution under18 U. S. C. Â§844(i) because such a
residence does not qualify as property â€œused
inâ€ commerce or commerce-affecting activity).[8]

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															For the reasons stated, we resist reading Â§1519
expansively to create a coverall spoliation of evidence statute,
advisable as such a measure might be. Leaving that important
decision to Congress, we hold that a â€œtangible
objectâ€ within Â§1519â€™s
compass is one used to record or preserve information. The judgment
of the U.Â S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1Â Yates was also charged with
making a false statement to federal law enforcement officers, in
violation of18 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§1001(a)(2). That charge, on which Yates was acquitted,
is not relevant to our analysis.
2Â The dissent assiduously
ignores all this, post, at 11â€“12, in
insisting that Congress wrote Â§1519 to cover, along
with shredded corporate documents, red grouper slightly smaller
than the legal limit.
3Â For the same reason, we do not
think the meaning of â€œtangible
objectsâ€ (or â€œtangible
things,â€ see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 26(b)) in other
discovery prescriptions cited by the Government leads to the
conclusion that â€œtangible objectâ€ in
Â§1519 encompasses any and all physical evidence
existing on land or in the sea.
4Â The dissent contends that
nothing can be drawn from the placement of Â§1519
because, before and after Sarbanes-Oxley, â€œall
of Chapter 73 was ordered chronologically.â€
Post, at 9. The argument might have some force if the
factual premise were correct. In Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress directed
insertion of Â§1514A before Â§1518,
then the last section in Chapter 73. If, as the dissent argues,
Congress adopted Â§1519 to fill out Â§1512,
post, at 6â€“7, it would have made more
sense for Congress to codify the substance of Â§1519
within Â§1512 or in a new Â§1512A, rather
than placing Â§1519 among specialized provisions.
Notably, in Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress added Â§1512(c)(1),
â€œa broad ban on
evidence-spoliation,â€ cf. post, at 9, n. 2, to
Â§1512, even though
Â§1512â€™s preexisting title and
provisions all related to witness-tampering.
5Â Despite this sweeping
â€œin relation toâ€ language, the
dissent remarkably suggests that Â§1519 does not
â€œordinarily operate in th[e] context [of]
federal court[s],â€ for those courts are not
â€œdepartment[s] or agenc[ies].â€
Post, at 10. That suggestion, which, as one would expect,
lacks the Governmentâ€™s endorsement, does not
withstand examination. The Senate Committee Report on
Â§1519, on which the dissent elsewhere relies, see
post, at 6, explained that an obstructive act is within
Â§1519â€™s scope if
â€œdone â€˜in
contemplationâ€™ of or in relation to a matter or
investigation.â€ S.Â Rep.
107â€“146, at 15. The Report further informed that
Â§1519 â€œis
.Â .Â . meant to do away with the
distinctions, which some courts have read into obstruction
statutes, between court proceedings, investigations, regulatory or
administrative proceedings (whether formal or not), and less formal
government inquiries, regardless of their title.â€
Ibid. If any doubt remained about the multiplicity of
contexts in which Â§1519 was designed to apply, the
Report added, â€œ[t]he intent of the provision is
simple; people should not be destroying, altering, or falsifying
documents to obstruct any government function.â€
Ibid.
6Â Furthermore, if
â€œtangible objectâ€ in
Â§1519 is read to include any physical object,
Â§1519 would prohibit all of the conduct proscribed by
Â§2232(a), which imposes a maximum penalty of five years
in prison for destroying or removing
â€œpropertyâ€ to prevent its seizure by
the Government. See supra, at
1â€“2.
7Â The dissent contends that
â€œrecord, document, or tangible
objectâ€ in Â§1519 should be construed in
conformity with â€œrecord, document, or other
objectâ€ in Â§1512(c)(1) because both
provisions address â€œthe same basic
problem.â€ Post, at 11â€“12. But
why should that be so when Congress prohibited in Â§1519
additional actions, specific to paper and electronic documents and
records, actions it did not prohibit in Â§1512(c)(1)?
When Congress passed Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, courts had already
interpreted the phrase â€œalter, destroy,
mutilate, or conceal an objectâ€ in
Â§1512(b)(2)(B) to apply to all types of physical
evidence. See, e.g., United States v.
Applewhaite, 195 F.Â 3d 679, 688 (CA3 1999)
(affirming conviction under Â§1512(b)(2)(B) for
persuading another person to paint over blood spatter).
Congressâ€™ use of a formulation in
Â§1519 that did not track the one used in
Â§1512(b)(2)(B) (and repeated in
Â§1512(c)(1)) suggests that Congress designed
Â§1519 to be interpreted apart from Â§1512,
not in lockstep with it.
8Â The dissent cites United
States v. McRae, 702 F.Â 3d 806,
834â€“838 (CA5 2012), United States v.
Maury, 695 F.Â 3d 227, 243â€“244
(CA3 2012), and United States v. Natal, 2014
U.Â S. Dist. LEXIS 108852, *24â€“*26
(Conn., Aug. 7, 2014), as cases that would not be covered by
Â§1519 as we read it. Post, at
18â€“19. Those cases supply no cause for concern
that persons who commit â€œmajorâ€
obstructive acts, id. at 18, will go unpunished. The
defendant in McRae, a police officer who seized a car
containing a corpse and then set it on fire, was also convicted for
that conduct under18 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§844(h) and sentenced to a term of 120
monthsâ€™ imprisonment for that offense. See 702
F.Â 3d, at 817â€“818,
839â€“840. The defendant in Natal, who
repainted a van to cover up evidence of a fatal arson, was also
convicted of three counts of violating18
U.Â S.Â C. Â§3 and sentenced to
concurrent terms of 174 monthsâ€™ imprisonment.
See Judgment in United States v. Morales, No.
3:12â€“crâ€“164 (Conn., Jan. 12,
2015). And the defendant in Maury, a company convicted under
Â§1519 of concealing evidence that a cement
mixerâ€™s safety lock was disabled when a
workerâ€™s fingers were amputated, was also
convicted of numerous other violations, including three counts of
violating18 U.Â S.Â C. Â§1505 for
concealing evidence of other worker safety violations. See 695
F.Â 3d, at 244â€“245. See also
United States v. Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Co.,
2007 WL 2282514, *70 (NJ, Aug. 2, 2007) (setting forth charges
against the company). For those violations, the company was fined
millions of dollars and ordered to operate under the supervision of
a court-appointed monitor. See 695 F.Â 3d, at
246.
