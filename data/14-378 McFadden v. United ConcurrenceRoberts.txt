															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															STEPHEN DOMINICK McFADDEN, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 18, 2015]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I join the Court’s opinion, except to the extent that it says the Government can satisfy the mental state requirement of Section 841(a)(1) “by showing that the defendant knew the identity of the substance he possessed.”  Ante, at 5.  Section 841(a)(1) makes it “unlawful for any person knowingly . . . to manufacture, distribute, or dispense . . . a controlled substance.”  As the Court points out, the word “knowingly” applies “not just to the statute’s verbs, but also to the object of those verbs—‘a controlled substance.’ ”  Ante, at 4 (emphasis deleted).  That suggests that a defendant needs to know more than the identity of the substance; he needs to know that the substance is controlled.  See, e.g., United States v. Howard, 773 F. 3d 519, 526 (CA4 2014); United States v. Washington, 596 F. 3d 926, 944 (CA8 2010); United States v. Rogers, 387 F. 3d 925, 935 (CA7 2004).

															In cases involving well-known drugs such as heroin, a defendant’s knowledge of the identity of the substance can be compelling evidence that he knows the substance is controlled.  See United States v. Turcotte, 405 F. 3d 515, 525 (CA7 2005).  But that is not necessarily true for lesser known drugs.  A pop quiz for any reader who doubts the point: Two drugs—dextromethorphan and hydrocodone—are both used as cough suppressants.  They are also both used as recreational drugs.  Which one is a controlled substance?[1]*

															The Court says that knowledge of the substance’s iden-tity suffices because “ignorance of the law is typically no defense to criminal prosecution.”  Ante, at 5.  I agree that is “typically” true.  But when “there is a legal element in the definition of the offense,” a person’s lack of knowledge regarding that legal element can be a defense.  Liparota v. United States,

471 U. S. 419
, n. 9 (1985).  And here, there is arguably a legal element in Section 841(a)(1)—that the substance be “controlled.”

															The analogy the Court drew in Liparota was to a charge of receipt of stolen property: It is no defense that the defendant did not know such receipt was illegal, but it is a defense that he did not know the property was stolen.  Here, the argument goes, it is no defense that a defendant did not know it was illegal to possess a controlled substance, but it is a defense that he did not know the substance was controlled.

															Ultimately, the Court’s statements on this issue are not necessary to its conclusion that the District Court’s jury instructions “did not fully convey the mental state required by the Analogue Act.”  Ante, at 10.  Those statements should therefore not be regarded as controlling if the issue arises in a future case.Notes
