															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															SHERRY L. BURT, WARDEN, PETITIONER v. VONLEE
NICOLE TITLOW

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[November 5, 2013]

															

															     Justice Sotomayor,
concurring.

															     In my view, this case
turns on Vonlee Titlow’s failure to present enough evidence
of what Frederick Toca did or did not do in the handful of days
after she hired him and before she withdrew her plea. As our
opinion notes, she bore the burden of overcoming two presumptions:
that Toca performed effectively and that the state court ruled
correctly. She failed to carry this burden. We need not say more,
and indeed we do not say more. I therefore join the Court’s
opinion in full. I write separately, however, to express my
understanding of our opinion’s limited scope, particularly
with respect to two statements that it makes about the adequacy of
Toca’s performance.

															     First, we state that
“[a]lthough a defendant’s proclamation of innocence
does not relieve counsel of his normal responsibilities under
Strickland, it may affect the advice counsel gives.” Ante, at
8. The first part of that statement bears emphasis: Regardless of
whether a defendant asserts her innocence (or admits her guilt),
her counsel must “make an independent examination of the
facts, circumstances, pleadings and laws involved and then . . .
offer his informed opinion as to what plea should be
entered.” Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U. S. 708, 721 (1948)
(plurality opinion). A defendant possesses “ ‘the
ultimate authority’ ” to determine her plea.
Florida v. Nixon, 543 U. S. 175, 187 (2004) . But a lawyer must
abide by his client’s decision in this respect only after
having provided the client with competent and fully informed
advice, including an analysis of the risks that the client would
face in proceeding to trial. Given our recognition that “a
defendant’s proclamation of innocence does not relieve
counsel of his normal responsibilities,” ante, at 8, our
further observation that such a proclamation “may affect the
advice counsel gives,” ibid., states only the obvious: that a
lawyer’s advice will always reflect the objectives of the
representation, as determined by the adequately informed
client.

															     Second, we state that
it was reasonable for the Michigan Court of Appeals to reject
respondent’s claim, “given that respondent was claiming
innocence and only days away from offering self-incriminating
testimony” at her aunt’s trial. Ante, at 9. This is
true in context: Because respondent failed to carry her burden of
showing that Toca’s performance was not adequate, the state
court reasonably held that it was. But our statement about the
facts of this case does not imply that an attorney performs
effectively in advising his client to withdraw from a plea whenever
the client asserts her innocence and has only a few days to make
the decision. Had respondent made a better factual record—had
she actually shown, for example, that Toca failed to educate
himself about the case before recommending that she withdraw her
plea—then she could well have prevailed.

															     Because (and only
because) respondent failed to present enough evidence to overcome
the twin presumptions of AEDPA and Strickland, I join fully in the
opinion of the Court.
