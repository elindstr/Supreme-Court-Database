PETITIONER

															21–707v.

															UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA,
et al.

															on writ of certiorari before judgment to the
united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 29, 2023]

															Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of
the Court.

															In these cases we consider whether the
admissions systems used by Harvard College and the University of
North Carolina, two of the oldest institutions of higher learning
in the United States, are lawful under the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment.

															I

															A

															Founded in 1636, Harvard College has one of
the most selective application processes in the country. Over
60,000 people applied to the school last year; fewer than 2,000
were admitted. Gaining admission to Harvard is thus no easy feat.
It can depend on having excellent grades, glowing recommendation
letters, or overcoming significant adversity. See 980 F.3d 157,
166–169 (CA1 2020). It can also depend on your race.

															The admissions process at Harvard works as
follows. Every application is initially screened by a “first
reader,” who assigns scores in six categories: academic,
extracurricular, athletic, school support, personal, and overall.
Ibid. A rating of “1” is the best; a rating of
“6” the worst. Ibid. In the academic category,
for example, a “1” signifies “near-perfect
standardized test scores and grades”; in the extracurricular
category, it indicates “truly unusual achievement”; and
in the personal category, it denotes “outstanding”
attributes like maturity, integrity, leadership, kindness, and
courage. Id., at 167–168. A score of “1”
on the overall rating—a composite of the five other
ratings—“signifies an exceptional candidate with
>90% chance of admission.” Id., at 169 (internal
quotation marks omitted). In assigning the overall rating, the
first readers “can and do take an applicant’s race into
account.” Ibid.

															Once the first read process is complete, Harvard
convenes admissions subcommittees. Ibid. Each subcommittee
meets for three to five days and evaluates all applicants from a
particular geographic area. Ibid. The subcommittees are
responsible for making recommendations to the full admissions
committee. Id., at 169–170. The subcommittees can and
do take an applicant’s race into account when making their
recommendations. Id., at 170.

															The next step of the Harvard process is the full
committee meeting. The committee has 40 members, and its discussion
centers around the applicants who have been recommended by the
regional subcommittees. Ibid. At the beginning of the
meeting, the committee discusses the relative breakdown of
applicants by race. The “goal,” according to
Harvard’s director of admissions, “is to make sure that
[Harvard does] not hav[e] a dramatic drop-off ” in
minority admissions from the prior class. 2 App. in No.
20–1199, pp. 744, 747–748. Each applicant considered by
the full committee is discussed one by one, and every member of the
committee must vote on admission. 980 F. 3d, at 170. Only when
an applicant secures a majority of the full committee’s votes
is he or she tentatively accepted for admission. Ibid. At
the end of the full committee meeting, the racial composition of
the pool of tentatively admitted students is disclosed to the
committee. Ibid.; 2 App. in No. 20–1199, at 861.

															The final stage of Harvard’s process is
called the “lop,” during which the list of tentatively
admitted students is winnowed further to arrive at the final class.
Any applicants that Harvard considers cutting at this stage are
placed on a “lop list,” which contains only four pieces
of information: legacy status, recruited athlete status, financial
aid eligibility, and race. 980 F. 3d, at 170. The full
committee decides as a group which students to lop. 397
F. Supp. 3d 126, 144 (Mass. 2019). In doing so, the
committee can and does take race into account. Ibid. Once
the lop process is complete, Harvard’s admitted class is set.
Ibid. In the Harvard admissions process, “race is a
determinative tip for” a significant percentage “of all
admitted African American and Hispanic applicants.”
Id., at 178.

															B

															Founded shortly after the Constitution was
ratified, the University of North Carolina (UNC) prides itself on
being the “nation’s first public university.” 567
F. Supp. 3d 580, 588 (MDNC 2021). Like Harvard,
UNC’s “admissions process is highly selective”:
In a typical year, the school “receives approximately 43,500
applications for its freshman class of 4,200.” Id., at
595.

															Every application the University receives is
initially reviewed by one of approximately 40 admissions office
readers, each of whom reviews roughly five applications per hour.
Id., at 596, 598. Readers are required to consider
“[r]ace and ethnicity . . . as one factor” in
their review. Id., at 597 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Other factors include academic performance and rigor,
standardized testing results, extracurricular involvement, essay
quality, personal factors, and student background. Id., at
600. Readers are responsible for providing numerical ratings for
the academic, extracurricular, personal, and essay categories.
Ibid. During the years at issue in this litigation,
underrepresented minority students were “more likely to score
[highly] on their personal ratings than their white and Asian
American peers,” but were more likely to be “rated
lower by UNC readers on their academic program, academic
performance, . . . extracurricular activities,” and
essays. Id., at 616–617.

															After assessing an applicant’s materials
along these lines, the reader “formulates an opinion about
whether the student should be offered admission” and then
“writes a comment defending his or her recommended
decision.” Id., at 598 (internal quotation marks
omitted). In making that decision, readers may offer students a
“plus” based on their race, which “may be
significant in an individual case.” Id., at 601
(internal quotation marks omitted). The admissions decisions made
by the first readers are, in most cases, “provisionally
final.” Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v.
University of N. C. at Chapel Hill, No.
1:14–cv–954 (MDNC, Nov. 9, 2020), ECF Doc. 225,
p. 7, ¶52.

															Following the first read process,
“applications then go to a process called ‘school group
review’ . . . where a committee composed of
experienced staff members reviews every [initial] decision.”
567 F. Supp. 3d, at 599. The review committee receives a
report on each student which contains, among other things, their
“class rank, GPA, and test scores; the ratings
assigned to them by their initial readers; and their status as
residents, legacies, or special recruits.” Ibid.
(footnote omitted). The review committee either approves or rejects
each admission recommendation made by the first reader, after which
the admissions decisions are finalized. Ibid. In making
those decisions, the review committee may also consider the
applicant’s race. Id., at 607; 2 App. in No.
21–707, p. 407.[1]

															C

															Petitioner, Students for Fair Admissions
(SFFA), is a nonprofit organization founded in 2014 whose purpose
is “to defend human and civil rights secured by law,
including the right of individuals to equal protection under the
law.” 980 F. 3d, at 164 (internal quotation marks
omitted). In November 2014, SFFA filed separate lawsuits against
Harvard College and the University of North Carolina, arguing that
their race-based admissions programs violated, respectively, Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78Stat. 252, 42
U. S. C. §2000d et seq., and the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[2] See 397 F. Supp. 3d, at
131–132; 567 F. Supp. 3d, at 585–586. The
District Courts in both cases held bench trials to evaluate
SFFA’s claims. See 980 F. 3d, at 179; 567
F. Supp. 3d, at 588. Trial in the Harvard case lasted 15
days and included testimony from 30 witnesses, after which the
Court concluded that Harvard’s admissions program comported
with our precedents on the use of race in college admissions. See
397 F. Supp. 3d, at 132, 183. The First Circuit affirmed
that determination. See 980 F. 3d, at 204. Similarly, in the
UNC case, the District Court concluded after an eight-day trial
that UNC’s admissions program was permissible under the Equal
Protection Clause. 567 F. Supp. 3d, at 588, 666.

															We granted certiorari in the Harvard case and
certiorari before judgment in the UNC case. 595 U. S. ___
(2022).

															II

															Before turning to the merits, we must assure
ourselves of our jurisdiction. See Summers v. Earth
Island Institute, 555 U.S.
488, 499 (2009). UNC argues that SFFA lacks standing to bring
its claims because it is not a “genuine” membership
organization. Brief for University Respondents in No. 21–707,
pp. 23–26. Every court to have considered this argument has
rejected it, and so do we. See Students for Fair Admissions,
Inc. v. University of Tex. at Austin, 37 F. 4th
1078, 1084–1086, and n. 8 (CA5 2022) (collecting
cases).

															Article III of the Constitution limits
“[t]he judicial power of the United States” to
“cases” or “controversies,” ensuring that
federal courts act only “as a necessity in the determination
of real, earnest and vital” disputes. Muskrat v.
United States, 219 U.S.
346, 351, 359 (1911) (internal quotation marks omitted).
“To state a case or controversy under Article III, a
plaintiff must establish standing.” Arizona Christian
School Tuition Organization v. Winn, 563 U.S.
125, 133 (2011). That, in turn, requires a plaintiff to
demonstrate that it has “(1) suffered an injury in fact,
(2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the
defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable
judicial decision.” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578
U.S. 330, 338 (2016).

															In cases like these, where the plaintiff is an
organization, the standing requirements of Article III can be
satisfied in two ways. Either the organization can claim that it
suffered an injury in its own right or, alternatively, it can
assert “standing solely as the representative of its
members.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S.
490, 511 (1975). The latter approach is known as
representational or organizational standing. Ibid.;
Summers, 555 U. S., at 497–498. To invoke it, an
organization must demonstrate that “(a) its members would
otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the
interests it seeks to protect are germane to the
organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim
asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of
individual members in the lawsuit.” Hunt v.
Washington State Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S.
333, 343 (1977).

															Respondents do not contest that SFFA satisfies
the three-part test for organizational standing articulated in
Hunt, and like the courts below, we find no basis in the
record to conclude otherwise. See 980 F. 3d, at 182–184;
397 F. Supp. 3d, at 183–184; No.
1:14–cv–954 (MDNC, Sept. 29, 2018), App. D to Pet. for
Cert. in No. 21–707, pp. 237–245 (2018 DC Opinion).
Respondents instead argue that SFFA was not a “genuine
‘membership organization’ ” when it filed
suit, and thus that it could not invoke the doctrine of
organizational standing in the first place. Brief for University
Respondents in No. 21–707, at 24. According to respondents,
our decision in Hunt established that groups qualify as
genuine membership organizations only if they are controlled and
funded by their members. And because SFFA’s members did
neither at the time this litigation commenced, respondents’
argument goes, SFFA could not represent its members for purposes of
Article III standing. Brief for University Respondents in No.
21–707, at 24 (citing Hunt, 432 U. S., at
343).

															Hunt involved the Washington State Apple
Advertising Commission, a state agency whose purpose was to protect
the local apple industry. The Commission brought suit challenging a
North Carolina statute that imposed a labeling requirement on
containers of apples sold in that State. The Commission argued that
it had standing to challenge the requirement on behalf of
Washington’s apple industry. See id., at
336–341. We recognized, however, that as a state agency,
“the Commission [wa]s not a traditional voluntary membership
organization . . . , for it ha[d] no members at
all.” Id., at 342. As a result, we could not easily
apply the three-part test for organizational standing, which asks
whether an organization’s members have standing. We
nevertheless concluded that the Commission had standing because the
apple growers and dealers it represented were effectively
members of the Commission. Id., at 344. The growers and
dealers “alone elect[ed] the members of the
Commission,” “alone . . . serve[d] on the
Commission,” and “alone finance[d] its
activities”—they possessed, in other words, “all
of the indicia of membership.” Ibid. The Commission
was therefore a genuine membership organization in substance, if
not in form. And it was “clearly” entitled to rely on
the doctrine of organizational standing under the three-part test
recounted above. Id., at 343.

															The indicia of membership analysis employed in
Hunt has no applicability in these cases. Here, SFFA
is indisputably a voluntary membership organization with
identifiable members—it is not, as in Hunt, a state
agency that concededly has no members. See 2018 DC Opinion
241–242. As the First Circuit in the Harvard litigation
observed, at the time SFFA filed suit, it was “a validly
incorporated 501(c)(3) nonprofit with forty-seven members who
joined voluntarily to support its mission.” 980 F. 3d,
at 184. Meanwhile in the UNC litigation, SFFA represented four
members in particular—high school graduates who were denied
admission to UNC. See 2018 DC Opinion 234. Those members filed
declarations with the District Court stating “that they have
voluntarily joined SFFA; they support its mission; they receive
updates about the status of the case from SFFA’s President;
and they have had the opportunity to have input and direction on
SFFA’s case.” Id., at 234–235 (internal
quotation marks omitted). Where, as here, an organization has
identified members and represents them in good faith, our cases do
not require further scrutiny into how the organization operates.
Because SFFA complies with the standing requirements demanded of
organizational plaintiffs in Hunt, its obligations under
Article III are satisfied.

															III

															A

															In the wake of the Civil War, Congress
proposed and the States ratified the Fourteenth Amendment,
providing that no State shall “deny to any person
. . . the equal protection of the laws.” Amdt. 14,
§1. To its proponents, the Equal Protection Clause represented
a “foundation[al] principle”—“the absolute
equality of all citizens of the United States politically and
civilly before their own laws.” Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st
Sess., 431 (1866) (statement of Rep. Bingham) (Cong. Globe). The
Constitution, they were determined, “should not permit any
distinctions of law based on race or color,” Supp. Brief for
United States on Reargument in Brown v. Board of
Education, O. T. 1953, No. 1 etc., p. 41 (detailing
the history of the adoption of the Equal Protection Clause),
because any “law which operates upon one man [should] operate
equally upon all,” Cong. Globe 2459 (statement of Rep.
Stevens). As soon-to-be President James Garfield observed, the
Fourteenth Amendment would hold “over every American citizen,
without regard to color, the protecting shield of law.”
Id., at 2462. And in doing so, said Senator Jacob Howard of
Michigan, the Amendment would give “to the humblest, the
poorest, the most despised of the race the same rights and the same
protection before the law as it gives to the most powerful, the
most wealthy, or the most haughty.” Id., at 2766. For
“[w]ithout this principle of equal justice,” Howard
continued, “there is no republican government and none that
is really worth maintaining.” Ibid.

															At first, this Court embraced the transcendent
aims of the Equal Protection Clause. “What is this,” we
said of the Clause in 1880, “but declaring that the law in
the States shall be the same for the black as for the white; that
all persons, whether colored or white, shall stand equal before the
laws of the States?” Strauder v. West Virginia,
100 U.S.
303, 307–309. “[T]he broad and benign provisions of
the Fourteenth Amendment” apply “to all persons,”
we unanimously declared six years later; it is “hostility to
. . . race and nationality” “which in the eye
of the law is not justified.” Yick Wo v.
Hopkins, 118 U.S.
356, 368–369, 373–374 (1886); see also id.,
at 368 (applying the Clause to “aliens and subjects of the
Emperor of China”); Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S.
33, 36 (1915) (“a native of Austria”); semble
Strauder, 100 U. S., at 308–309 (“Celtic
Irishmen”) (dictum).

															Despite our early recognition of the broad sweep
of the Equal Protection Clause, this Court—alongside the
country—quickly failed to live up to the Clause’s core
commitments. For almost a century after the Civil War,
state-mandated segregation was in many parts of the Nation a
regrettable norm. This Court played its own role in that ignoble
history, allowing in Plessy v. Ferguson the separate
but equal regime that would come to deface much of America.
163 U.S.
537 (1896). The aspirations of the framers of the Equal
Protection Clause, “[v]irtually strangled in [their]
infancy,” would remain for too long only
that—aspirations. J. Tussman & J. tenBroek, The Equal
Protection of the Laws, 37 Cal. L. Rev. 341, 381 (1949).

															After Plessy, “American courts
. . . labored with the doctrine [of separate but equal]
for over half a century.” Brown v. Board of
Education, 347
U.S. 483, 491 (1954). Some cases in this period attempted to
curtail the perniciousness of the doctrine by emphasizing that it
required States to provide black students educational opportunities
equal to—even if formally separate from—those enjoyed
by white students. See, e.g., Missouri ex rel. Gaines
v. Canada, 305 U.S.
337, 349–350 (1938) (“The admissibility of laws
separating the races in the enjoyment of privileges afforded by the
State rests wholly upon the equality of the privileges which the
laws give to the separated groups . . . .”).
But the inherent folly of that approach—of trying to derive
equality from inequality—soon became apparent. As the Court
subsequently recognized, even racial distinctions that were argued
to have no palpable effect worked to subordinate the afflicted
students. See, e.g., McLaurin v. Oklahoma State
Regents for Higher Ed., 339 U.S.
637, 640–642 (1950) (“It is said that the
separations imposed by the State in this case are in form merely
nominal. . . . But they signify that the State
. . . sets [petitioner] apart from the other
students.”). By 1950, the inevitable truth of the Fourteenth
Amendment had thus begun to reemerge: Separate cannot be equal.

															The culmination of this approach came finally in
Brown v. Board of Education. In that seminal
decision, we overturned Plessy for good and set firmly on
the path of invalidating all de jure racial
discrimination by the States and Federal Government. 347
U. S., at 494–495. Brown concerned the
permissibility of racial segregation in public schools. The school
district maintained that such segregation was lawful because the
schools provided to black students and white students were of
roughly the same quality. But we held such segregation
impermissible “even though the physical facilities and
other ‘tangible’ factors may be equal.”
Id., at 493 (emphasis added). The mere act of separating
“children . . . because of their race,” we
explained, itself “generate[d] a feeling of
inferiority.” Id., at 494.

															The conclusion reached by the Brown Court
was thus unmistakably clear: the right to a public education
“must be made available to all on equal terms.”
Id., at 493. As the plaintiffs had argued, “no State
has any authority under the equal-protection clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment to use race as a factor in affording
educational opportunities among its citizens.” Tr. of Oral
Arg. in Brown I, O. T. 1952, No. 8, p. 7 (Robert
L. Carter, Dec. 9, 1952); see also Supp. Brief for Appellants on
Reargument in Nos. 1, 2, and 4, and for Respondents in No. 10, in
Brown v. Board of Education, O. T. 1953, p.
65 (“That the Constitution is color blind is our dedicated
belief.”); post, at 39, n. 7 (Thomas, J.,
concurring). The Court reiterated that rule just one year later,
holding that “full compliance” with Brown
required schools to admit students “on a racially
nondiscriminatory basis.” Brown v. Board of
Education, 349 U.S.
294, 300–301 (1955). The time for making distinctions
based on race had passed. Brown, the Court observed,
“declar[ed] the fundamental principle that racial
discrimination in public education is unconstitutional.”
Id., at 298.

															So too in other areas of life. Immediately after
Brown, we began routinely affirming lower court decisions
that invalidated all manner of race-based state action. In
Gayle v. Browder, for example, we summarily affirmed
a decision invalidating state and local laws that required
segregation in busing. 352 U.S. 903 (1956) (per curiam). As
the lower court explained, “[t]he equal protection clause
requires equality of treatment before the law for all persons
without regard to race or color.” Browder v.
Gayle, 
142 F. Supp. 707, 715 (MD Ala. 1956). And in Mayor and City
Council of Baltimore v. Dawson, we summarily affirmed a
decision striking down racial segregation at public beaches and
bathhouses maintained by the State of Maryland and the city of
Baltimore. 350 U.S. 877 (1955) (per curiam). “It is
obvious that racial segregation in recreational activities can no
longer be sustained,” the lower court observed. Dawson
v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 220 F.2d 386, 387
(CA4 1955) (per curiam). “[T]he ideal of equality
before the law which characterizes our institutions” demanded
as much. Ibid.

															In the decades that followed, this Court
continued to vindicate the Constitution’s pledge of racial
equality. Laws dividing parks and golf courses; neighborhoods and
businesses; buses and trains; schools and juries were undone, all
by a transformative promise “stemming from our American ideal
of fairness”: “ ‘the Constitution
. . . forbids . . . discrimination by the
General Government, or by the States, against any citizen because
of his race.’ ” Bolling v. Sharpe,
347 U.S.
497, 499 (1954) (quoting Gibson v. Mississippi,
162 U.S.
565, 591 (1896) (Harlan, J., for the Court)). As we recounted
in striking down the State of Virginia’s ban on interracial
marriage 13 years after Brown, the Fourteenth Amendment
“proscri[bes] . . . all invidious racial
discriminations.” Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S.
1, 8 (1967). Our cases had thus “consistently denied the
constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights of citizens
on account of race.” Id., at 11–12; see
also Yick Wo, 118 U. S., at 373–375 (commercial
property); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1
(1948) (housing covenants); Hernandez v. Texas,
347 U.S.
475 (1954) (composition of juries); Dawson, 350
U. S., at 877 (beaches and bathhouses); Holmes v.
Atlanta, 350 U.S. 879 (1955) (per curiam) (golf
courses); Browder, 352 U. S., at 903 (busing); New
Orleans City Park Improvement Assn. v. Detiege,
358 U.S.
54 (1958) (per curiam) (public parks); Bailey v.
Patterson, 369 U.S.
31 (1962) (per curiam) (transportation facilities);
Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1
(1971) (education); Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S.
79 (1986) (peremptory jury strikes).

															These decisions reflect the “core
purpose” of the Equal Protection Clause: “do[ing] away
with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on
race.” Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S.
429, 432 (1984) (footnote omitted). We have recognized that
repeatedly. “The clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth
Amendment was to eliminate all official state sources of invidious
racial discrimination in the States.” Loving, 388
U. S., at 10; see also Washington v. Davis,
426 U.S.
229, 239 (1976) (“The central purpose of the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the prevention of
official conduct discriminating on the basis of race.”);
McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S.
184, 192 (1964) (“[T]he historical fact [is] that the
central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate racial
discrimination.”).

															Eliminating racial discrimination means
eliminating all of it. And the Equal Protection Clause, we have
accordingly held, applies “without regard to any differences
of race, of color, or of nationality”—it is
“universal in [its] application.” Yick Wo, 118
U. S., at 369. For “[t]he guarantee of equal protection
cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something
else when applied to a person of another color.” Regents
of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S.
265, 289–290 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). “If
both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not
equal.” Id., at 290.

															Any exception to the Constitution’s demand
for equal protection must survive a daunting two-step examination
known in our cases as “strict scrutiny.” Adarand
Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S.
200, 227 (1995). Under that standard we ask, first, whether the
racial classification is used to “further compelling
governmental interests.” Grutter v. Bollinger,
539 U.S.
306, 326 (2003). Second, if so, we ask whether the
government’s use of race is “narrowly
tailored”—meaning “necessary”—to
achieve that interest. Fisher v. University of Tex. at
Austin, 570 U.S.
297, 311–312 (2013) (Fisher I ) (internal
quotation marks omitted).

															Outside the circumstances of these cases, our
precedents have identified only two compelling interests that
permit resort to race-based government action. One is remediating
specific, identified instances of past discrimination that violated
the Constitution or a statute. See, e.g., Parents
Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No.
1, 551 U.S.
701, 720 (2007); Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S.
899, 909–910 (1996); post, at 19–20,
30–31 (opinion of Thomas, J.). The second is avoiding
imminent and serious risks to human safety in prisons, such as a
race riot. See Johnson v. California, 543 U.S.
499, 512–513 (2005).[3]

															Our acceptance of race-based state action has
been rare for a reason. “Distinctions between citizens solely
because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free
people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of
equality.” Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S.
495, 517 (2000) (quoting Hirabayashi v. United
States, 320 U.S.
81, 100 (1943)). That principle cannot be overridden except in
the most extraordinary case.

															B

															These cases involve whether a university may
make admissions decisions that turn on an applicant’s race.
Our Court first considered that issue in Regents of University
of California v. Bakke, which involved a set-aside
admissions program used by the University of California, Davis,
medical school. 438 U. S., at 272–276. Each year, the
school held 16 of its 100 seats open for members of certain
minority groups, who were reviewed on a special admissions track
separate from those in the main admissions pool. Id., at
272–275. The plaintiff, Allan Bakke, was denied admission two
years in a row, despite the admission of minority applicants with
lower grade point averages and MCAT scores. Id., at
276–277. Bakke subsequently sued the school, arguing that its
set-aside program violated the Equal Protection Clause.

															In a deeply splintered decision that produced
six different opinions—none of which commanded a majority of
the Court—we ultimately ruled in part in favor of the school
and in part in favor of Bakke. Justice Powell announced the
Court’s judgment, and his opinion—though written for
himself alone—would eventually come to “serv[e] as the
touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions
policies.” Grutter, 539 U. S., at 323.

															Justice Powell began by finding three of the
school’s four justifications for its policy not sufficiently
compelling. The school’s first justification of
“reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored
minorities in medical schools,” he wrote, was akin to
“[p]referring members of any one group for no reason other
than race or ethnic origin.” Bakke, 438 U. S., at
306–307 (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet that was
“discrimination for its own sake,” which “the
Constitution forbids.” Id., at 307 (citing, inter
alia, Loving, 388 U. S., at 11). Justice Powell
next observed that the goal of “remedying . . . the
effects of ‘societal discrimination’ ” was
also insufficient because it was “an amorphous concept of
injury that may be ageless in its reach into the past.”
Bakke, 438 U. S., at 307. Finally, Justice Powell found
there was “virtually no evidence in the record indicating
that [the school’s] special admissions program” would,
as the school had argued, increase the number of doctors working in
underserved areas. Id., at 310.

															Justice Powell then turned to the school’s
last interest asserted to be compelling—obtaining the
educational benefits that flow from a racially diverse student
body. That interest, in his view, was “a constitutionally
permissible goal for an institution of higher education.”
Id., at 311–312. And that was so, he opined, because a
university was entitled as a matter of academic freedom “to
make its own judgments as to . . . the selection of its
student body.” Id., at 312.

															But a university’s freedom was not
unlimited. “Racial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are
inherently suspect,” Justice Powell explained, and antipathy
toward them was deeply “rooted in our Nation’s
constitutional and demographic history.” Id., at 291.
A university could not employ a quota system, for example,
reserving “a specified number of seats in each class for
individuals from the preferred ethnic groups.” Id., at
315. Nor could it impose a “multitrack program with a
prescribed number of seats set aside for each identifiable category
of applicants.” Ibid. And neither still could it use
race to foreclose an individual “from all consideration
. . . simply because he was not the right color.”
Id., at 318.

															The role of race had to be cabined. It could
operate only as “a ‘plus’ in a particular
applicant’s file.” Id., at 317. And even then,
race was to be weighed in a manner “flexible enough to
consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light of the
particular qualifications of each applicant.” Ibid.
Justice Powell derived this approach from what he called the
“illuminating example” of the admissions system then
used by Harvard College. Id., at 316. Under that system, as
described by Harvard in a brief it had filed with the Court,
“the race of an applicant may tip the balance in his favor
just as geographic origin or a life [experience] may tip the
balance in other candidates’ cases.” Ibid.
(internal quotation marks omitted). Harvard continued: “A
farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a
Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually
bring something that a white person cannot offer.”
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The result,
Harvard proclaimed, was that “race has been”—and
should be—“a factor in some admission decisions.”
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

															No other Member of the Court joined Justice
Powell’s opinion. Four Justices instead would have held that
the government may use race for the purpose of “remedying the
effects of past societal discrimination.” Id., at 362
(joint opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.,
concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Four other
Justices, meanwhile, would have struck down the Davis program as
violative of Title VI. In their view, it “seem[ed] clear that
the proponents of Title VI assumed that the Constitution itself
required a colorblind standard on the part of government.”
Id., at 416 (Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and
Stewart and Rehnquist, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part). The Davis program therefore flatly contravened
a core “principle imbedded in the constitutional and
moral understanding of the times”: the prohibition against
“racial discrimination.” Id., at 418, n. 21
(internal quotation marks omitted).

															C

															In the years that followed our
“fractured decision in Bakke,” lower courts
“struggled to discern whether Justice Powell’s”
opinion constituted “binding precedent.”
Grutter, 539 U. S., at 325. We accordingly took up the
matter again in 2003, in the case Grutter v.
Bollinger, which concerned the admissions system used by the
University of Michigan law school. Id., at 311. There, in
another sharply divided decision, the Court for the first time
“endorse[d] Justice Powell’s view that student body
diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify the use
of race in university admissions.” Id., at 325.

															The Court’s analysis tracked Justice
Powell’s in many respects. As for compelling interest, the
Court held that “[t]he Law School’s educational
judgment that such diversity is essential to its educational
mission is one to which we defer.” Id., at 328. In
achieving that goal, however, the Court made clear—just as
Justice Powell had—that the law school was limited in the
means that it could pursue. The school could not “establish
quotas for members of certain racial groups or put members of those
groups on separate admissions tracks.” Id., at 334.
Neither could it “insulate applicants who belong to certain
racial or ethnic groups from the competition for admission.”
Ibid. Nor still could it desire “some specified
percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or
ethnic origin.” Id., at 329–330 (quoting
Bakke, 438 U. S., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.)).

															These limits, Grutter explained, were
intended to guard against two dangers that all race-based
government action portends. The first is the risk that the use of
race will devolve into “illegitimate . . .
stereotyp[ing].” Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co.,
488 U.S.
469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion). Universities were thus not
permitted to operate their admissions programs on the “belief
that minority students always (or even consistently) express some
characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue.”
Grutter, 539 U. S., at 333 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The second risk is that race would be used not as a plus,
but as a negative—to discriminate against those racial
groups that were not the beneficiaries of the race-based
preference. A university’s use of race, accordingly, could
not occur in a manner that “unduly harm[ed] nonminority
applicants.” Id., at 341.

															But even with these constraints in place,
Grutter expressed marked discomfort with the use of race in
college admissions. The Court stressed the fundamental principle
that “there are serious problems of justice connected with
the idea of [racial] preference itself.” Ibid.
(quoting Bakke, 438 U. S., at 298 (opinion of Powell,
J.)). It observed that all “racial classifications, however
compelling their goals,” were “dangerous.”
Grutter, 539 U. S., at 342. And it cautioned that all
“race-based governmental action” should “remai[n]
subject to continuing oversight to assure that it will work the
least harm possible to other innocent persons competing for the
benefit.” Id., at 341 (internal quotation marks
omitted).

															To manage these concerns, Grutter imposed
one final limit on race-based admissions programs. At some point,
the Court held, they must end. Id., at 342. This requirement
was critical, and Grutter emphasized it repeatedly.
“[A]ll race-conscious admissions programs [must] have a
termination point”; they “must have reasonable
durational limits”; they “must be limited in
time”; they must have “sunset provisions”; they
“must have a logical end point”; their “deviation
from the norm of equal treatment” must be “a temporary
matter.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The
importance of an end point was not just a matter of repetition. It
was the reason the Court was willing to dispense temporarily with
the Constitution’s unambiguous guarantee of equal protection.
The Court recognized as much: “[e]nshrining a permanent
justification for racial preferences,” the Court explained,
“would offend this fundamental equal protection
principle.” Ibid.; see also id., at
342–343 (quoting N. Nathanson & C. Bartnik, The
Constitutionality of Preferential Treatment for Minority Applicants
to Professional Schools, 58 Chi. Bar Rec. 282, 293 (May–June
1977), for the proposition that “[i]t would be a sad day
indeed, were America to become a quota-ridden society, with each
identifiable minority assigned proportional representation in every
desirable walk of life”).

															Grutter thus concluded with the following
caution: “It has been 25 years since Justice Powell first
approved the use of race to further an interest in student body
diversity in the context of public higher education.
. . . We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial
preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest
approved today.” 539 U. S., at 343.

															IV

															Twenty years later, no end is in sight.
“Harvard’s view about when [race-based admissions will
end] doesn’t have a date on it.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in
No. 20–1199, p. 85; Brief for Respondent in No.
20–1199, p. 52. Neither does UNC’s. 567
F. Supp. 3d, at 612. Yet both insist that the use of race
in their admissions programs must continue.

															But we have permitted race-based admissions only
within the confines of narrow restrictions. University programs
must comply with strict scrutiny, they may never use race as a
stereotype or negative, and—at some point—they must
end. Respondents’ admissions systems—however well
intentioned and implemented in good faith—fail each of these
criteria. They must therefore be invalidated under the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[4]

															A

															Because “[r]acial discrimination [is]
invidious in all contexts,” Edmonson v. Leesville
Concrete Co., 500 U.S.
614, 619 (1991), we have required that universities operate
their race-based admissions programs in a manner that is
“sufficiently measurable to permit judicial [review]”
under the rubric of strict scrutiny, Fisher v. University
of Tex. at Austin, 579 U.S. 365, 381 (2016) (Fisher II).
“Classifying and assigning” students based on their
race “requires more than . . . an amorphous end to
justify it.” Parents Involved, 551 U. S., at
735.

															Respondents have fallen short of satisfying that
burden. First, the interests they view as compelling cannot be
subjected to meaningful judicial review. Harvard identifies the
following educational benefits that it is pursuing:
(1) “training future leaders in the public and private
sectors”; (2) preparing graduates to “adapt to an
increasingly pluralistic society”; (3) “better
educating its students through diversity”; and
(4) “producing new knowledge stemming from diverse
outlooks.” 980 F. 3d, at 173–174. UNC points to
similar benefits, namely, “(1) promoting the robust
exchange of ideas; (2) broadening and refining understanding;
(3) fostering innovation and problem-solving;
(4) preparing engaged and productive citizens and leaders;
[and] (5) enhancing appreciation, respect, and empathy,
cross-racial understanding, and breaking down stereotypes.”
567 F. Supp. 3d, at 656.

															Although these are commendable goals, they are
not sufficiently coherent for purposes of strict scrutiny. At the
outset, it is unclear how courts are supposed to measure any of
these goals. How is a court to know whether leaders have been
adequately “train[ed]”; whether the exchange of ideas
is “robust”; or whether “new knowledge” is
being developed? Ibid.; 980 F. 3d, at 173–174.
Even if these goals could somehow be measured, moreover, how is a
court to know when they have been reached, and when the perilous
remedy of racial preferences may cease? There is no particular
point at which there exists sufficient “innovation and
problem-solving,” or students who are appropriately
“engaged and productive.” 567 F. Supp. 3d, at
656. Finally, the question in this context is not one of no
diversity or of some: it is a question of degree. How many
fewer leaders Harvard would create without racial preferences, or
how much poorer the education at Harvard would be, are inquiries no
court could resolve.

															Comparing respondents’ asserted goals to
interests we have recognized as compelling further illustrates
their elusive nature. In the context of racial violence in a
prison, for example, courts can ask whether temporary racial
segregation of inmates will prevent harm to those in the prison.
See Johnson, 543 U. S., at 512–513. When it comes
to workplace discrimination, courts can ask whether a race-based
benefit makes members of the discriminated class “whole for
[the] injuries [they] suffered.” Franks v. Bowman
Transp. Co., 424 U.S.
747, 763 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). And in
school segregation cases, courts can determine whether any
race-based remedial action produces a distribution of students
“compar[able] to what it would have been in the absence of
such constitutional violations.” Dayton Bd. of Ed. v.
Brinkman, 433 U.S.
406, 420 (1977).

															Nothing like that is possible when it comes to
evaluating the interests respondents assert here. Unlike discerning
whether a prisoner will be injured or whether an employee should
receive backpay, the question whether a particular mix of minority
students produces “engaged and productive citizens,”
sufficiently “enhance[s] appreciation, respect, and
empathy,” or effectively “train[s] future
leaders” is standardless. 567 F. Supp. 3d, at 656;
980 F. 3d, at 173–174. The interests that respondents
seek, though plainly worthy, are inescapably imponderable.

															Second, respondents’ admissions programs
fail to articulate a meaningful connection between the means they
employ and the goals they pursue. To achieve the educational
benefits of diversity, UNC works to avoid the underrepresentation
of minority groups, 567 F. Supp. 3d, at 591–592,
and n. 7, while Harvard likewise “guard[s ] against
inadvertent drop-offs in representation” of certain minority
groups from year to year, Brief for Respondent in No.
20–1199, at 16. To accomplish both of those goals, in turn,
the universities measure the racial composition of their classes
using the following categories: (1) Asian; (2) Native
Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; (3) Hispanic; (4) White;
(5) African-American; and (6) Native American. See,
e.g., 397 F. Supp. 3d, at 137, 178; 3 App. in No.
20–1199, at 1278, 1280–1283; 3 App. in No.
21–707, at 1234–1241. It is far from evident, though,
how assigning students to these racial categories and making
admissions decisions based on them furthers the educational
benefits that the universities claim to pursue.

															For starters, the categories are themselves
imprecise in many ways. Some of them are plainly overbroad: by
grouping together all Asian students, for instance, respondents are
apparently uninterested in whether South Asian or
East Asian students are adequately represented, so long as
there is enough of one to compensate for a lack of the other.
Meanwhile other racial categories, such as “Hispanic,”
are arbitrary or undefined. See, e.g., M. Lopez, J.
Krogstad, & J. Passel, Pew Research Center, Who is Hispanic?
(Sept. 15, 2022) (referencing the “long history of changing
labels [and] shifting categories . . . reflect[ing]
evolving cultural norms about what it means to be Hispanic or
Latino in the U. S. today”). And still other categories
are underinclusive. When asked at oral argument “how are
applicants from Middle Eastern countries classified, [such as]
Jordan, Iraq, Iran, [and] Egypt,” UNC’s counsel
responded, “[I] do not know the answer to that
question.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21–707, p. 107; cf.
post, at 6–7 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (detailing the
“incoherent” and “irrational stereotypes”
that these racial categories further).

															Indeed, the use of these opaque racial
categories undermines, instead of promotes, respondents’
goals. By focusing on underrepresentation, respondents would
apparently prefer a class with 15% of students from Mexico over a
class with 10% of students from several Latin American countries,
simply because the former contains more Hispanic students than the
latter. Yet “[i]t is hard to understand how a plan that could
allow these results can be viewed as being concerned with achieving
enrollment that is ‘broadly diverse.’ ”
Parents Involved, 551 U. S., at 724 (quoting
Grutter, 539 U. S., at 329). And given the mismatch
between the means respondents employ and the goals they seek, it is
especially hard to understand how courts are supposed to scrutinize
the admissions programs that respondents use.

															The universities’ main response to these
criticisms is, essentially, “trust us.” None of the
questions recited above need answering, they say, because
universities are “owed deference” when using race to
benefit some applicants but not others. Brief for University
Respondents in No. 21–707, at 39 (internal quotation marks
omitted). It is true that our cases have recognized a
“tradition of giving a degree of deference to a
university’s academic decisions.” Grutter, 539
U. S., at 328. But we have been unmistakably clear that any
deference must exist “within constitutionally prescribed
limits,” ibid., and that “deference does not
imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review,”
Miller–El v. Cockrell, 537
U.S. 322, 340 (2003). Universities may define their missions as
they see fit. The Constitution defines ours. Courts may not license
separating students on the basis of race without an exceedingly
persuasive justification that is measurable and concrete enough to
permit judicial review. As this Court has repeatedly reaffirmed,
“[r]acial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit
any but the most exact connection between justification and
classification.” Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S.
244, 270 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). The
programs at issue here do not satisfy that standard.[5]

															B

															The race-based admissions systems that
respondents employ also fail to comply with the twin commands of
the Equal Protection Clause that race may never be used as a
“negative” and that it may not operate as a
stereotype.

															First, our cases have stressed that an
individual’s race may never be used against him in the
admissions process. Here, however, the First Circuit found that
Harvard’s consideration of race has led to an 11.1% decrease
in the number of Asian-Americans admitted to Harvard. 980
F. 3d, at 170, n. 29. And the District Court observed
that Harvard’s “policy of considering applicants’
race . . . overall results in fewer Asian American and
white students being admitted.” 397 F. Supp. 3d, at
178.

															Respondents nonetheless contend that an
individual’s race is never a negative factor in their
admissions programs, but that assertion cannot withstand scrutiny.
Harvard, for example, draws an analogy between race and other
factors it considers in admission. “[W]hile admissions
officers may give a preference to applicants likely to excel in the
Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra,” Harvard explains, “that
does not mean it is a ‘negative’ not to excel at a
musical instrument.” Brief for Respondent in No.
20–1199, at 51. But on Harvard’s logic, while it gives
preferences to applicants with high grades and test scores,
“that does not mean it is a
‘negative’ ” to be a student with lower
grades and lower test scores. Ibid. This understanding of
the admissions process is hard to take seriously. College
admissions are zero-sum. A benefit provided to some applicants but
not to others necessarily advantages the former group at the
expense of the latter.

															Respondents also suggest that race is not a
negative factor because it does not impact many admissions
decisions. See id., at 49; Brief for University Respondents
in No. 21–707, at 2. Yet, at the same time, respondents also
maintain that the demographics of their admitted classes would
meaningfully change if race-based admissions were abandoned. And
they acknowledge that race is determinative for at least
some—if not many—of the students they admit. See,
e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 20–1199, at 67; 567
F. Supp. 3d, at 633. How else but “negative”
can race be described if, in its absence, members of some racial
groups would be admitted in greater numbers than they otherwise
would have been? The “[e]qual protection of the laws is not
achieved through indiscriminate imposition of inequalities.”
Shelley, 334 U. S., at 22.[6]

															Respondents’ admissions programs are
infirm for a second reason as well. We have long held that
universities may not operate their admissions programs on the
“belief that minority students always (or even consistently)
express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue.”
Grutter, 539 U. S., at 333 (internal quotation marks
omitted). That requirement is found throughout our Equal Protection
Clause jurisprudence more generally. See, e.g.,
Schuette v. BAMN, 572 U.S.
291, 308 (2014) (plurality opinion) (“In cautioning
against ‘impermissible racial stereotypes,’ this Court
has rejected the assumption that ‘members of the same racial
group—regardless of their age, education, economic status, or
the community in which they live—think alike
. . . .’ ” (quoting Shaw v.
Reno, 509 U.S.
630, 647 (1993))).

															Yet by accepting race-based admissions programs
in which some students may obtain preferences on the basis of race
alone, respondents’ programs tolerate the very thing that
Grutter foreswore: stereotyping. The point of
respondents’ admissions programs is that there is an inherent
benefit in race qua race—in race for race’s
sake. Respondents admit as much. Harvard’s admissions process
rests on the pernicious stereotype that “a black student can
usually bring something that a white person cannot offer.”
Bakke, 438 U. S., at 316 (opinion of Powell, J.)
(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. in
No. 20–1199, at 92. UNC is much the same. It argues that race
in itself “says [something] about who you are.” Tr. of
Oral Arg. in No. 21–707, at 97; see also id., at 96
(analogizing being of a certain race to being from a rural
area).

															We have time and again forcefully rejected the
notion that government actors may intentionally allocate preference
to those “who may have little in common with one another but
the color of their skin.” Shaw, 509 U. S., at
647. The entire point of the Equal Protection Clause is that
treating someone differently because of their skin color is
not like treating them differently because they are from a
city or from a suburb, or because they play the violin poorly or
well.

															“One of the principal reasons race is
treated as a forbidden classification is that it demeans the
dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of
by his or her own merit and essential qualities.”
Rice, 528 U. S., at 517. But when a university admits
students “on the basis of race, it engages in the offensive
and demeaning assumption that [students] of a particular race,
because of their race, think alike,” Miller v.
Johnson, 515 U.S.
900, 911–912 (1995) (internal quotation marks
omitted)—at the very least alike in the sense of being
different from nonminority students. In doing so, the university
furthers “stereotypes that treat individuals as the product
of their race, evaluating their thoughts and efforts—their
very worth as citizens—according to a criterion barred to the
Government by history and the Constitution.” Id., at
912 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such stereotyping can only
“cause[ ] continued hurt and injury,”
Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 631, contrary as it is to the
“core purpose” of the Equal Protection Clause,
Palmore, 466 U. S., at 432.

															C

															If all this were not enough,
respondents’ admissions programs also lack a “logical
end point.” Grutter, 539 U. S., at 342.

															Respondents and the Government first suggest
that respondents’ race-based admissions programs will end
when, in their absence, there is “meaningful representation
and meaningful diversity” on college campuses. Tr. of Oral
Arg. in No. 21–707, at 167. The metric of meaningful
representation, respondents assert, does not involve any
“strict numerical benchmark,” id., at 86; or
“precise number or percentage,” id., at 167; or
“specified percentage,” Brief for Respondent in No.
20–1199, at 38 (internal quotation marks omitted). So what
does it involve?

															Numbers all the same. At Harvard, each full
committee meeting begins with a discussion of “how the
breakdown of the class compares to the prior year in terms of
racial identities.” 397 F. Supp. 3d, at 146. And
“if at some point in the admissions process it appears that a
group is notably underrepresented or has suffered a dramatic drop
off relative to the prior year, the Admissions Committee may decide
to give additional attention to applications from students within
that group.” Ibid.; see also id., at 147
(District Court finding that Harvard uses race to “trac[k]
how each class is shaping up relative to previous years with an eye
towards achieving a level of racial diversity”); 2 App. in
No. 20–1199, at 821–822.

															The results of the Harvard admissions process
reflect this numerical commitment. For the admitted classes of 2009
to 2018, black students represented a tight band of
10.0%–11.7% of the admitted pool. The same theme held true
for other minority groups:

															

															Brief for Petitioner in No. 20–1199
etc., p. 23. Harvard’s focus on numbers is obvious.[7]

															UNC’s admissions program operates
similarly. The University frames the challenge it faces as
“the admission and enrollment of underrepresented
minorities,” Brief for University Respondents in No.
21–707, at 7, a metric that turns solely on whether a
group’s “percentage enrollment within the undergraduate
student body is lower than their percentage within the general
population in North Carolina,” 567 F. Supp. 3d, at
591, n. 7; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21–707, at
79. The University “has not yet fully achieved its
diversity-related educational goals,” it explains, in part
due to its failure to obtain closer to proportional representation.
Brief for University Respondents in No. 21–707, at 7; see
also 567 F. Supp. 3d, at 594.

															The problem with these approaches is well
established. “[O]utright racial balancing” is
“patently unconstitutional.” Fisher I, 570
U. S., at 311 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is so,
we have repeatedly explained, because “[a]t the heart of the
Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection lies the simple
command that the Government must treat citizens as individuals, not
as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national
class.” Miller, 515 U. S., at 911 (internal
quotation marks omitted). By promising to terminate their use of
race only when some rough percentage of various racial groups is
admitted, respondents turn that principle on its head. Their
admissions programs “effectively assure[ ] that race
will always be relevant . . . and that the ultimate goal
of eliminating” race as a criterion “will never be
achieved.” Croson, 488 U. S., at 495 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

															Respondents’ second proffered end point
fares no better. Respondents assert that universities will no
longer need to engage in race-based admissions when, in their
absence, students nevertheless receive the educational benefits of
diversity. But as we have already explained, it is not clear how a
court is supposed to determine when stereotypes have broken down or
“productive citizens and leaders” have been created.
567 F. Supp. 3d, at 656. Nor is there any way to know
whether those goals would adequately be met in the absence of a
race-based admissions program. As UNC itself acknowledges, these
“qualitative standard[s]” are “difficult to
measure.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21–707, at 78; but
see Fisher II, 579 U. S., at 381 (requiring race-based
admissions programs to operate in a manner that is
“sufficiently measurable”).

															Third, respondents suggest that race-based
preferences must be allowed to continue for at least five more
years, based on the Court’s statement in Grutter that
it “expect[ed] that 25 years from now, the use of racial
preferences will no longer be necessary.” 539 U. S., at
343. The 25-year mark articulated in Grutter, however,
reflected only that Court’s view that race-based preferences
would, by 2028, be unnecessary to ensure a requisite level of
racial diversity on college campuses. Ibid. That expectation
was oversold. Neither Harvard nor UNC believes that race-based
admissions will in fact be unnecessary in five years, and both
universities thus expect to continue using race as a criterion well
beyond the time limit that Grutter suggested. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. in No. 20–1199, at 84–85; Tr. of Oral Arg. in
No. 21–707, at 85–86. Indeed, the high school
applicants that Harvard and UNC will evaluate this fall using their
race-based admissions systems are expected to graduate in
2028—25 years after Grutter was decided.

															Finally, respondents argue that their programs
need not have an end point at all because they frequently review
them to determine whether they remain necessary. See Brief for
Respondent in No. 20–1199, at 52; Brief for University
Respondents in No. 21–707, at 58–59. Respondents point
to language in Grutter that, they contend, permits
“the durational requirement [to] be met” with
“periodic reviews to determine whether racial preferences are
still necessary to achieve student body diversity.” 539
U. S., at 342. But Grutter never suggested that
periodic review could make unconstitutional conduct constitutional.
To the contrary, the Court made clear that race-based admissions
programs eventually had to end—despite whatever periodic
review universities conducted. Ibid.; see also supra,
at 18.

															Here, however, Harvard concedes that its
race-based admissions program has no end point. Brief for
Respondent in No. 20–1199, at 52 (Harvard “has not set
a sunset date” for its program (internal quotation marks
omitted)). And it acknowledges that the way it thinks about the use
of race in its admissions process “is the same now as it
was” nearly 50 years ago. Tr. of Oral Arg. in No.
20–1199, at 91. UNC’s race-based admissions program is
likewise not set to expire any time soon—nor, indeed, any
time at all. The University admits that it “has not set forth
a proposed time period in which it believes it can end all
race-conscious admissions practices.” 567
F. Supp. 3d, at 612. And UNC suggests that it might soon
use race to a greater extent than it currently does. See
Brief for University Respondents in No. 21–707, at 57. In
short, there is no reason to believe that respondents
will—even acting in good faith—comply with the Equal
Protection Clause any time soon.

															V

															The dissenting opinions resist these
conclusions. They would instead uphold respondents’
admissions programs based on their view that the Fourteenth
Amendment permits state actors to remedy the effects of societal
discrimination through explicitly race-based measures. Although
both opinions are thorough and thoughtful in many respects, this
Court has long rejected their core thesis.

															The dissents’ interpretation of the Equal
Protection Clause is not new. In Bakke, four Justices would
have permitted race-based admissions programs to remedy the effects
of societal discrimination. 438 U. S., at 362 (joint opinion
of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in
judgment in part and dissenting in part). But that minority view
was just that—a minority view. Justice Powell, who provided
the fifth vote and controlling opinion in Bakke, firmly
rejected the notion that societal discrimination constituted a
compelling interest. Such an interest presents “an amorphous
concept of injury that may be ageless in its reach into the
past,” he explained. Id., at 307. It cannot
“justify a [racial] classification that imposes disadvantages
upon persons . . . who bear no responsibility for
whatever harm the beneficiaries of the [race-based] admissions
program are thought to have suffered.” Id., at
310.

															The Court soon adopted Justice Powell’s
analysis as its own. In the years after Bakke, the Court
repeatedly held that ameliorating societal discrimination does not
constitute a compelling interest that justifies race-based state
action. “[A]n effort to alleviate the effects of societal
discrimination is not a compelling interest,” we said plainly
in Hunt, a 1996 case about the Voting Rights Act. 517
U. S., at 909–910. We reached the same conclusion in
Croson, a case that concerned a preferential government
contracting program. Permitting “past societal
discrimination” to “serve as the basis for rigid racial
preferences would be to open the door to competing claims for
‘remedial relief ’ for every disadvantaged
group.” 488 U. S., at 505. Opening that door would
shutter another—“[t]he dream of a Nation of equal
citizens . . . would be lost,” we observed,
“in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently
unmeasurable claims of past wrongs.” Id., at
505–506. “[S]uch a result would be contrary to both the
letter and spirit of a constitutional provision whose central
command is equality.” Id., at 506.

															The dissents here do not acknowledge any of
this. They fail to cite Hunt. They fail to cite
Croson. They fail to mention that the entirety of their
analysis of the Equal Protection Clause—the statistics, the
cases, the history—has been considered and rejected before.
There is a reason the principal dissent must invoke Justice
Marshall’s partial dissent in Bakke nearly a dozen
times while mentioning Justice Powell’s controlling opinion
barely once (Justice Jackson’s opinion ignores Justice Powell
altogether). For what one dissent denigrates as “rhetorical
flourishes about colorblindness,” post, at 14 (opinion
of Sotomayor, J.), are in fact the proud pronouncements of cases
like Loving and Yick Wo, like Shelley and
Bolling—they are defining statements of law. We
understand the dissents want that law to be different. They are
entitled to that desire. But they surely cannot claim the mantle of
stare decisis while pursuing it.[8]

															The dissents are no more faithful to our
precedent on race-based admissions. To hear the principal dissent
tell it, Grutter blessed such programs indefinitely, until
“racial inequality will end.” Post, at 54
(opinion of Sotomayor, J.). But Grutter did no such thing.
It emphasized—not once or twice, but at least six separate
times—that race-based admissions programs “must have
reasonable durational limits” and that their “deviation
from the norm of equal treatment” must be “a temporary
matter.” 539 U. S., at 342. The Court also disclaimed
“[e]nshrining a permanent justification for racial
preferences.” Ibid. Yet the justification for
race-based admissions that the dissent latches on to is just
that—unceasing.

															The principal dissent’s reliance on
Fisher II is similarly mistaken. There, by a 4-to-3 vote,
the Court upheld a “sui generis” race-based
admissions program used by the University of Texas, 579 U. S.,
at 377, whose “goal” it was to enroll a “critical
mass” of certain minority students, Fisher I, 570
U. S., at 297. But neither Harvard nor UNC claims to be using
the critical mass concept—indeed, the universities admit they
do not even know what it means. See 1 App. in No. 21–707,
at 402 (“[N]o one has directed anybody to achieve a
critical mass, and I’m not even sure we would know what it
is.” (testimony of UNC administrator)); 3 App. in No.
20–1199, at 1137–1138 (similar testimony from
Harvard administrator).

															Fisher II also recognized the
“enduring challenge” that race-based admissions systems
place on “the constitutional promise of equal
treatment.” 579 U. S., at 388. The Court thus reaffirmed
the “continuing obligation” of universities “to
satisfy the burden of strict scrutiny.” Id., at 379.
To drive the point home, Fisher II limited itself just as
Grutter had—in duration. The Court stressed that its
decision did “not necessarily mean the University may
rely on the same policy” going forward. 579 U. S., at
388 (emphasis added); see also Fisher I, 570 U. S., at
313 (recognizing that “Grutter . . .
approved the plan at issue upon concluding that it . . .
was limited in time”). And the Court openly acknowledged that
its decision offered limited “prospective guidance.”
Fisher II, 579 U. S., at 379.[9]

															The principal dissent wrenches our case law from
its context, going to lengths to ignore the parts of that law it
does not like. The serious reservations that Bakke,
Grutter, and Fisher had about racial preferences go
unrecognized. The unambiguous requirements of the Equal Protection
Clause—“the most rigid,” “searching”
scrutiny it entails—go without note. Fisher I, 570
U. S., at 310. And the repeated demands that race-based
admissions programs must end go overlooked—contorted, worse
still, into a demand that such programs never stop.

															Most troubling of all is what the dissent must
make these omissions to defend: a judiciary that picks winners and
losers based on the color of their skin. While the dissent would
certainly not permit university programs that discriminated
against black and Latino applicants, it is perfectly willing
to let the programs here continue. In its view, this Court is
supposed to tell state actors when they have picked the right races
to benefit. Separate but equal is “inherently
unequal,” said Brown. 347 U. S., at 495 (emphasis
added). It depends, says the dissent.

															That is a remarkable view of the judicial
role—remarkably wrong. Lost in the false pretense of judicial
humility that the dissent espouses is a claim to power so radical,
so destructive, that it required a Second Founding to undo.
“Justice Harlan knew better,” one of the dissents
decrees. Post, at 5 (opinion of Jackson, J.). Indeed
he did:

															“[I]n view of the Constitution, in
the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant,
ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our Constitution
is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among
citizens.” Plessy, 163 U. S., at 559 (Harlan, J.,
dissenting).

															VI

															For the reasons provided above, the Harvard
and UNC admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the
guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause. Both programs lack
sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use
of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve
racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points. We have never
permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not
do so today.

															At the same time, as all parties agree, nothing
in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities
from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race
affected his or her life, be it through discrimination,
inspiration, or otherwise. See, e.g., 4 App. in No.
21–707, at 1725–1726, 1741; Tr. of Oral Arg. in No.
20–1199, at 10. But, despite the dissent’s assertion to
the contrary, universities may not simply establish through
application essays or other means the regime we hold unlawful
today. (A dissenting opinion is generally not the best source of
legal advice on how to comply with the majority opinion.)
“[W]hat cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly.
The Constitution deals with substance, not shadows,” and the
prohibition against racial discrimination is “levelled at the
thing, not the name.” Cummings v. Missouri, 4
Wall. 277, 325 (1867). A benefit to a student who overcame racial
discrimination, for example, must be tied to that
student’s courage and determination. Or a benefit to a
student whose heritage or culture motivated him or her to assume a
leadership role or attain a particular goal must be tied to that
student’s unique ability to contribute to the university.
In other words, the student must be treated based on his or her
experiences as an individual—not on the basis of race.

															Many universities have for too long done just
the opposite. And in doing so, they have concluded, wrongly, that
the touchstone of an individual’s identity is not challenges
bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their
skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice.

															The judgments of the Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit and of the District Court for the Middle District of
North Carolina are reversed.

															It is so ordered.

															

															Justice Jackson took no part in the
consideration or decision of the case in No. 20–1199.

Notes
1
 Justice Jackson attempts
to minimize the role that race plays in UNC’s admissions
process by noting that, from 2016–2021, the school accepted a
lower “percentage of the most academically excellent in-state
Black candidates”—that is, 65 out of 67 such applicants
(97.01%)—than it did similarly situated Asian
applicants—that is, 1118 out of 1139 such applicants
(98.16%). Post, at 20 (dissenting opinion); see also 3 App.
in No. 21–707, pp. 1078–1080. It is not clear how the
rejection of just two black applicants over five years could be
“indicative of a genuinely holistic [admissions]
process,” as Justice Jackson contends. Post, at
20–21. And indeed it cannot be, as the overall
acceptance rates of academically excellent applicants to UNC
illustrates full well. According to SFFA’s expert, over 80%
of all black applicants in the top academic decile were admitted to
UNC, while under 70% of white and Asian applicants in that decile
were admitted. 3 App. in No. 21–707, at 1078–1083. In
the second highest academic decile, the disparity is even starker:
83% of black applicants were admitted, while 58% of white
applicants and 47% of Asian applicants were admitted. Ibid.
And in the third highest decile, 77% of black applicants were
admitted, compared to 48% of white applicants and 34% of Asian
applicants. Ibid. The dissent does not dispute the accuracy
of these figures. See post, at 20, n. 94 (opinion of
Jackson, J.). And its contention that white and Asian students
“receive a diversity plus” in UNC’s race-based
admissions system blinks reality. Post, at 18. The same is
true at Harvard. See Brief for Petitioner 24 (“[A]n African
American [student] in [the fourth lowest academic] decile has a
higher chance of admission (12.8%) than an Asian American in the
top decile (12.7%).” (emphasis added)); see also 4
App. in No. 20–1199, p. 1793 (black applicants in the top
four academic deciles are between four and ten times more likely to
be admitted to Harvard than Asian applicants in those
deciles).

 Title VI provides that
“[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of
race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in,
be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under
any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.” 42 U. S. C. §2000d. “We
have explained that discrimination that violates the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment committed by an
institution that accepts federal funds also constitutes a violation
of Title VI.” Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S.
244, 276, n. 23 (2003). Although Justice Gorsuch questions
that proposition, no party asks us to reconsider it. We accordingly
evaluate Harvard’s admissions program under the standards of
the Equal Protection Clause itself.
3
 The first time we
determined that a governmental racial classification satisfied
“the most rigid scrutiny” was 10 years before
Brown v. Board of Education, 347
U.S. 483 (1954), in the infamous case Korematsu v.
United States, 323 U.S.
214, 216 (1944). There, the Court upheld the internment of
“all persons of Japanese ancestry in prescribed West Coast
. . . areas” during World War II because “the
military urgency of the situation demanded” it. Id.,
at 217, 223. We have since overruled Korematsu, recognizing
that it was “gravely wrong the day it was decided.”
Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip
op., at 38). The Court’s decision in Korematsu
nevertheless “demonstrates vividly that even the most rigid
scrutiny can sometimes fail to detect an illegitimate racial
classification” and that “[a]ny retreat from the most
searching judicial inquiry can only increase the risk of another
such error occurring in the future.” Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.S.
200, 236 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). The
principal dissent, for its part, claims that the Court has also
permitted “the use of race when that use burdens minority
populations.” Post, at 38–39 (opinion of
Sotomayor, J.). In support of that claim, the dissent cites two
cases that have nothing to do with the Equal Protection Clause. See
ibid. (citing United States v. Brignoni-Ponce,
422 U.S.
873 (1975) ( Fourth Amendment case), and United States
v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S.
543 (1976) (another Fourth Amendment case)).
4
 The United States as
amicus curiae contends that race-based admissions programs
further compelling interests at our Nation’s military
academies. No military academy is a party to these cases, however,
and none of the courts below addressed the propriety of race-based
admissions systems in that context. This opinion also does not
address the issue, in light of the potentially distinct interests
that military academies may present.
5
 For that reason, one
dissent candidly advocates abandoning the demands of strict
scrutiny. See post, at 24, 26–28 (opinion of Jackson,
J.) (arguing the Court must “get out of the way,”
“leav[e] well enough alone,” and defer to universities
and “experts” in determining who should be
discriminated against). An opinion professing fidelity to history
(to say nothing of the law) should surely see the folly in that
approach.
6
 Justice Jackson contends
that race does not play a “determinative role for
applicants” to UNC. Post, at 24. But even the
principal dissent acknowledges that race—and race
alone—explains the admissions decisions for hundreds if not
thousands of applicants to UNC each year. Post, at 33, n. 28
(opinion of Sotomayor, J.); see also Students for Fair
Admissions, Inc. v. University of N. C. at Chapel
Hill, No. 1:14–cv–954 (MDNC, Dec. 21, 2020), ECF
Doc. 233, at 23–27 (UNC expert testifying that race explains
1.2% of in state and 5.1% of out of state admissions decisions); 3
App. in No. 21–707, at 1069 (observing that UNC evaluated
57,225 in state applicants and 105,632 out of state applicants from
2016–2021). The suggestion by the principal dissent that our
analysis relies on extra-record materials, see post, at
29–30, n. 25 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), is simply
mistaken.
7
 The principal dissent
claims that “[t]he fact that Harvard’s racial shares of
admitted applicants varies relatively little . . . is
unsurprising and reflects the fact that the racial makeup of
Harvard’s applicant pool also varies very little over this
period.” Post, at 35 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.)
(internal quotation marks omitted). But that is exactly the point:
Harvard must use precise racial preferences year in and year out to
maintain the unyielding demographic composition of its class. The
dissent is thus left to attack the numbers themselves, arguing they
were “handpicked” “from a truncated
period.” Ibid., n. 29 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). As
supposed proof, the dissent notes that the share of Asian students
at Harvard varied significantly from 1980 to 1994—a 14-year
period that ended nearly three decades ago. 4 App. in No.
20–1199, at 1770. But the relevance of that
observation—handpicked and truncated as it is—is lost
on us. And the dissent does not and cannot dispute that the share
of black and Hispanic students at Harvard—“the primary
beneficiaries” of its race-based admissions policy—has
remained consistent for decades. 397 F. Supp. 3d, at 178; 4
App. in No. 20–1199, at 1770. For all the talk of holistic
and contextual judgments, the racial preferences at issue here in
fact operate like clockwork.
8
 Perhaps recognizing as
much, the principal dissent at one point attempts to press a
different remedial rationale altogether, stating that both
respondents “have sordid legacies of racial exclusion.”
Post, at 21 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). Such institutions
should perhaps be the very last ones to be allowed to make
race-based decisions, let alone be accorded deference in doing so.
In any event, neither university defends its admissions system as a
remedy for past discrimination—their own or anyone
else’s. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 21–707, at 90
(“[W]e’re not pursuing any sort of remedial
justification for our policy.”). Nor has any decision of ours
permitted a remedial justification for race-based college
admissions. Cf. Bakke, 438 U. S., at 307 (opinion of
Powell, J.).
9
 The principal dissent
rebukes the Court for not considering adequately the reliance
interests respondents and other universities had in Grutter.
But as we have explained, Grutter itself limited the
reliance that could be placed upon it by insisting, over and over
again, that race-based admissions programs be limited in time. See
supra, at 20. Grutter indeed went so far as to
suggest a specific period of reliance—25
years—precluding the indefinite reliance interests that the
dissent articulates. Cf. post, at 2–4 (Kavanaugh, J.,
concurring). Those interests are, moreover, vastly overstated on
their own terms. Three out of every five American universities do
not consider race in their admissions decisions. See Brief
for Respondent in No. 20–1199, p. 40. And several
States—including some of the most populous (California,
Florida, and Michigan)—have prohibited race-based admissions
outright. See Brief for Oklahoma et al. as Amici Curiae
9, n. 6.
