															MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.

															No. 451 was argued and submitted with Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, No. 450, just decided.  Nos. 451 and 466 were argued at the same time in the Supreme Court of Alabama with the case of Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, No. 450, and were decided on the authority of that case.  That court said (49 So. 412):

															"These cases [Nos. 450, 451, and 466] were argued, submitted, and considered together, and the points raised by the pleadings in each case are, for convenience, treated of and embodied in the one opinion,"

															referring to the opinion in the Greene case.

															These cases are embraced within the opinion in the Greene case in this Court.  For the reasons stated in that case, both of these cases are reversed and remanded to the Supreme Court of Alabama for further proceedings consistent with that opinion.

															MR. JUSTICE LURTON was not on the bench when Nos. 450 and 451 were argued and submitted.  No. 466 was submitted after he took his seat on the bench, and I am permitted to say, for the 
															Page 216 U. S. 420
															 reasons stated in the opinion in No. 450, Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, he concurs in the judgment in No. 466.

															Reversed.

															Dissenting:  THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE McKENNA, and MR. JUSTICE HOLMES.
