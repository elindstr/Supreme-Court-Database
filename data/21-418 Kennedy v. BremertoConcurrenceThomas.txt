															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–418

															_________________

															JOSEPH A. KENNEDY, PETITIONER v.
BREMERTON SCHOOL DISTRICT

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 27, 2022]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion because it
correctly holds that Bremerton School District violated Joseph
Kennedy’s First Amendment rights. I write separately to
emphasize that the Court’s opinion does not resolve two
issues related to Kennedy’s free-exercise claim.

															First, the Court refrains from deciding whether
or how public employees’ rights under the Free Exercise
Clause may or may not be different from those enjoyed by the
general public. See ante, at 19, n. 2. In “striking
the appropriate balance” between public employees’
constitutional rights and “the realities of the employment
context,” we have often “consider[ed] whether the
asserted employee right implicates the basic concerns of the
relevant constitutional provision, or whether the claimed right can
more readily give way to the requirements of the government as
employer.” Engquist v. Oregon Dept. of
Agriculture, 553 U.S.
591, 600 (2008). In the free-speech context, for example, that
inquiry has prompted us to distinguish between different kinds of
speech; we have held that “the First Amendment protects
public employee speech only when it falls within the core of First
Amendment protection—speech on matters of public
concern.” Ibid. It remains an open question, however,
if a similar analysis can or should apply to free-exercise claims
in light of the “history” and “tradition”
of the Free Exercise Clause. Borough of Duryea v.
Guarnieri, 564 U.S.
379, 406 (2011) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part); see also id., at 400 (Thomas, J.,
concurring in judgment).

															Second, the Court also does not decide what
burden a government employer must shoulder to justify restricting
an employee’s religious expression because the District had
no constitutional basis for reprimanding Kennedy under any possibly
applicable standard of scrutiny. See ante, at 20. While we
have many public-employee precedents addressing how the
interest-balancing test set out in Pickering v. Board of
Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,
391 U.S.
563 (1968), applies under the Free Speech Clause, the Court has
never before applied Pickering balancing to a claim brought
under the Free Exercise Clause. A government employer’s
burden therefore might differ depending on which First Amendment
guarantee a public employee invokes.
