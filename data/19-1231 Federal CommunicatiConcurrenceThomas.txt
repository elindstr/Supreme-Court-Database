															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit

															[April 1, 2021]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															As the Court correctly holds, the Federal Communications Commission’s orders were not arbitrary and capricious.  Based on the record evidence available, the FCC reasonably concluded that modifying its broadcast ownership rules would not harm minority and female ownership of broadcast media.  I write separately to note another, independent reason why reversal is warranted: The Third Circuit improperly imposed nonstatutory procedural requirements on the FCC by forcing it to consider ownership diversity in the first place.

															The FCC had no obligation to consider minority and female ownership.  Nothing in §202(h) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 directs the FCC to consider rates of minority and female ownership.  See note following

47 U. S. C. §303 (requiring the FCC simply to consider “ ‘the public interest as the result of competition’ ”).  Nor could any court force the FCC to consider ownership diversity: Courts have no authority to impose “judge-made procedur[es]” on agencies.  Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn.,

575 U.S. 92, 102 (2015).

															Disregarding these limits, the Third Circuit imposed on the FCC a nonstatutory requirement to consider minority and female ownership.  The court first did so in 2004 when it vacated the FCC’s modification of its Local Television Ownership Rule, faulting the FCC for “failing to mention anything about the effect this change would have on potential minority station owners.”  373 F.3d 372, 420 (2004).  It then directed the FCC on remand to “consider . . . proposals for enhancing ownership opportunities for women and minorities.”  Id., at 435, n. 82; accord, 652 F.3d 431, 471 (2011) (reiterating that its “prior remand requir[ed] the Commission to consider the effect of its rules on minority and female ownership”).  Repeating this error in 2016, the Third Circuit mandated that the FCC, “in addition to §202(h)’s requirement . . . , include a determination about ‘the effect of the rules on minority and female ownership.’ ”  824 F.3d 33, 54, n. 13 (quoting 652 F. 3d, at 471; brackets omitted).

															Respondents try to defend the Third Circuit’s ruling by noting that the FCC has previously discussed ownership diversity when considering its ownership rules.  They contend that the FCC thus believed that a purpose of those rules is to promote minority and female ownership.  And because an agency cannot “depart from a prior policy sub silentio,” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,

556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009), they argue that the FCC either had to consider ownership diversity or expressly repudiate its prior policy.  That argument fails because the FCC’s ownership rules—unlike some of its nonownership rules—were never designed to foster ownership diversity.

															From its infancy, the FCC has generally focused on consumers, not producers.  The year after it was established, the agency that would later become the FCC made clear that “ ‘emphasis must be first and foremost on the interest, the convenience, and the necessity of the listening public, and not on the interest, convenience, or necessity of the individual broadcaster.’ ”  FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co.,

309 U.S. 134, 139, n. 2 (1940) (quoting a 1928 agency document).

															The FCC kept true to that design when promulgating ownership rules.  For example, when it created the Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule at issue here, the agency explained that its “ownership rules rest on two foundations: the twin goals of diversity of viewpoints and economic competition,” and that viewpoint diversity is the “higher” policy.  50 F. C. C. 2d 1046, 1074 (1975); see also 22 F. C. C. 2d 306, 313, ¶25 (1970) (stating that the “principal purpose” of the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule is “promot[ing] diversity of viewpoints” and a secondary purpose is “promot[ing] competition”).  To these two consumer-focused goals, the FCC has also added a third: localism.  18 FCC Rcd. 13620, 13624, ¶8, 13645, ¶81 (2003).  None of these objectives advances demographic diversity of owners for the sake of owners.

															To be sure, the FCC has sometimes considered minority and female ownership of broadcast media when discussing ownership rules.  Time after time, however, it has viewed those forms of diversity not “as policy goals in and of themselves, but as proxies for viewpoint diversity.”  17 FCC Rcd. 18503, 18519, ¶41, and n. 116, 18521, ¶50 (2002); accord, e.g., 18 FCC Rcd., at 13774, ¶389 (“diversity of ownership promotes diversity of viewpoints”); id., at 13636, ¶51, 13760, ¶355 (similar); 10 FCC Rcd. 2788, ¶¶1–2 (1995) (“promoting minority ownership of broadcasting and cable television facilities serves to enhance the diversity of viewpoints presented”).  The FCC has also said that ownership diversity “promote[s] competition.”  Id., at 2789, ¶6; accord, 22 F. C. C. 2d, at 313, ¶25.  And although the FCC has occasionally used language that, read in isolation, could suggest a freestanding goal of promoting ownership diversity, e.g., 17 FCC Rcd., at 18521, ¶50 (“[T]he Commission has historically used the ownership rules to foster ownership by diverse groups, such as minorities, women and small businesses”), these comments must be viewed in the light of the FCC’s repeated statements that “the core Commission goal [is] maximizing the diversity of points of view available to the public” and that “promoting minority [and female] ownership of broadcasting and cable television facilities serves” this core goal.  E.g., 10 FCC Rcd., at 2788, ¶¶1–2.

															Even while trying to abide by the Third Circuit’s improper mandate, the FCC clarified in this proceeding that it considered ownership diversity a potential means to pursue viewpoint diversity, not a freestanding goal of its ownership rules.  To cite just a few examples, in its 2016 order the FCC explained that it “has a long history of promulgating rules and regulations intended to promote diversity of ownership among broadcast licensees, and thereby foster a diversity of voices.”  App. 335 (emphasis added).  It afforded certain companies waivers from various rules to “serve our broader goal of diversity of ownership, and thus viewpoint diversity.”  Id., at 337 (emphasis added).  And it noted that it could not promulgate a race-conscious regulation without first “demonstrat[ing] a connection between minority ownership and viewpoint diversity” that would “satisfy strict scrutiny.”  Id., at 397; cf. Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC,

497 U.S. 547, 566–568 (1990) (upholding race-conscious “minority ownership policies” because they were “substantially related to the achievement of . . . broadcast diversity”—i.e., viewpoint diversity), overruled by Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña,

515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995) (requiring strict scrutiny for “all racial classifications”).

															The Third Circuit erred by disregarding this history.  For example, when the FCC modified its Local Television Ownership Rule in 2003, the court faulted the FCC for “failing to mention anything about the effect this change would have on potential minority station owners.”  373 F. 3d, at 420.  But as with its other ownership rules, the stated “objectives” for that rule were fostering viewpoint diversity and competition.  14 FCC Rcd. 12903, 12910–12912, ¶¶15, 17 (1999).[1]

															Here, as in 2003, once the FCC determined that none of its policy objectives for ownership rules—viewpoint diversity, competition, and localism—justified retaining its rules, the FCC was free to modify or repeal them without considering ownership diversity.  Indeed, the FCC has long been clear that “it would be inappropriate to retain multiple ownership regulations for the sole purpose of promoting minority ownership.”  100 F. C. C. 2d 74, 94, ¶45 (1985).  The Third Circuit had no authority to require the FCC to consider minority and female ownership.  So in future reviews, the FCC is under no obligation to do so.[2]
Notes
1
 The FCC reiterated these objectives when modifying the rule in 2003.  18 FCC Rcd. 13620, 13708, ¶¶225–226. 

2
 The FCC has recently questioned the validity of the assumption that ownership diversity promotes viewpoint diversity.  32 FCC Rcd. 9802, 9810, ¶15, n. 49 (2017).  Its previous acceptance of that assumption in no way precludes the FCC from rejecting it in the future.
