															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															INTEGRITY STAFFING SOLUTIONS, INC., PETITIONER
v. JESSE BUSK et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[December 9, 2014]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kagan
joins, concurring.

															I concur in the Court’s opinion, and write
separately only to explain my understanding of the standards the
Court applies.

															The Court reaches two critical conclusions.
First, the Court confirms that compensable
“ ‘principal’ ” activities
“ ‘includ[e] . . . those closely related
activities which are indispensable to [a principal
activity’s] performance,’ ” ante, at
6 (quoting 29 CFR §790.8(c)(2013)), and holds that the
required security screenings here were not “integral and
indispensable” to another principal activity the employees
were employed to perform, ante, at 7. I agree. As both
Department of Labor regulations and our precedent make clear, an
activity is “indispensable” to another, principal
activity only when an employee could not dispense with it without
impairing his ability to perform the principal activity safely and
effectively. Thus, although a battery plant worker might, for
example, perform his principal activities without donning proper
protective gear, he could not do so safely, see Steiner v.
Mitchell, 350 U. S. 247 –253 (1956); likewise, a
butcher might be able to cut meat without having sharpened his
knives, but he could not do so effectively, see Mitchell v.
King Packing Co., 350 U. S. 260 –263 (1956); accord,
29 CFR §790.8(c). Here, by contrast, the security screenings
were not “integral and indispensable” to the
employees’ other principal activities in this sense. The
screenings may, as the Ninth Circuit observed below, have been in
some way related to the work that the employees performed in the
warehouse, see 713 F. 3d 525, 531 (2013), but the employees could
skip the screenings altogether without the safety or effectiveness
of their principal activities being substantially impaired, see
ante, at 7.

															Second, the Court holds also that the screenings
were not themselves “ ‘principal . . .
activities’ ” the employees were
“ ‘employed to perform.’ ”
Ibid. (quoting 29 U. S. C. §254(a)(1)). On this point,
I understand the Court’s analysis to turn on its conclusion
that undergoing security screenings was not itself work of
consequence that the employees performed for their employer. See
ante, at 7. Again, I agree. As the statute’s use of
the words “preliminary” and “postliminary”
suggests, §254(a)(2), and as our precedents make clear, the
Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 is primarily concerned with defining
the beginning and end of the workday. See IBP, Inc. v.
Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21 ,34–37 (2005). It distinguishes
between activities that are essentially part of the ingress and
egress process, on the one hand, and activities that constitute the
actual “work of consequence performed for an employer,”
on the other hand. 29 CFR §790.8(a); see also ibid.
(clarifying that a principal activity need not predominate over
other activities, and that an employee could be employed to perform
multiple principal activities). The security screenings at issue
here fall on the “preliminary . . . or postliminary”
side of this line. 29 U. S. C. §254(a)(2). The
searches were part of the process by which the employees egressed
their place of work, akin to checking in and out and waiting in
line to do so—activities that Congress clearly deemed to be
preliminary or postlimininary. See S. Rep. No. 48, 80th Cong., 1st
Sess., 47 (1947); 29 CFR §790.7(g). Indeed, as the Court
observes, the Department of Labor reached the very same conclusion
regarding similar security screenings shortly after the
Portal-to-Portal Act was adopted, see ante, at 7–8,
and we owe deference to that determination, see Christensen
v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576, 587 (2000) .

															Because I understand the Court’s opinion
to be consistent with the foregoing, I join it.
