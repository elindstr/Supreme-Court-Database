U.S. Supreme CourtTod v. Pratt, 60 U.S. 19 How. 362 362 (1859)
Tod v. Pratt
60 U.S. (19 How.) 362

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
Syllabus 

															The decision in the preceding case of Pratt v. Reed again affirmed.

															MR. JUSTICE NELSON delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The libel was filed by the appellants in the court below, to recover for supplies furnished the steamboat Sultana, at Cleveland, in the State of Ohio.  The supplies furnished were coal, which, according to the account current, began in April, 1853, and continued from time to time till April, 1854.

															The defense set up was the mortgage which has been referred to in the case of Pratt v. Reed, just decided.  There was also a second ground of defense, which it is not material to notice.  The district court decreed in favor of the defendants, except as it respects some five hundred dollars, which item has not been appealed from.  The circuit court affirmed the decree.

															The case falls within the principles stated in that above referred to, and which determined that the mortgagees were entitled to the proceeds of the vessel in the registry.  This was the result of the decision of the court below, and the decree is therefore

															Affirmed.
