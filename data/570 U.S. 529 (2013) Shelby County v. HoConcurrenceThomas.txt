															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															SHELBY COUNTY, ALABAMA, PETITIONER v. ERIC H.
HOLDER, Jr., ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

															[June 25, 2013]

															

															     Justice Thomas,
concurring.

															     I join the
Court’s opinion in full but write separately to explain that
I would find §5 of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional as
well. The Court’s opinion sets forth the reasons.

															     “The Voting
Rights Act of 1965 employed extraordinary measures to address an
extraordinary problem.” Ante, at 1. In the face of
“unremitting and ingenious defiance” of citizens’
constitutionally protected right to vote, §5 was necessary to
give effect to the Fifteenth Amendment in particular regions of the
country. South Carolina v. Katzen-bach, 383 U. S. 301, 309
(1966) . Though §5’s preclear- ance requirement
represented a “shar[p] depart[ure]” from “basic
principles” of federalism and the equal sovereignty of the
States, ante, at 9, 11, the Court upheld the measure against early
constitutional challenges because it was necessary at the time to
address “voting discrimination where it persist[ed] on a
pervasive scale.” Katzenbach, supra, at 308.

															     Today, our Nation has
changed. “[T]he conditions that originally justified
[§5] no longer characterize voting in the covered
jurisdictions.” Ante, at 2. As the Court explains:
“ ‘[V]oter turnout and registration rates now
approach parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal
decrees are rare. And minority candidates hold office at
un-precedented levels.’ ” Ante, at 13–14
(quoting Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder,
557 U. S. 193, 202 (2009) ).

															     In spite of these
improvements, however, Congress increased the already significant
burdens of §5. Following its reenactment in 2006, the Voting
Rights Act was amended to “prohibit more conduct than
before.” Ante, at 5. “Section 5 now forbids voting
changes with ‘any dis-criminatory purpose’ as well as
voting changes that diminish the ability of citizens, on account of
race, color, or language minority status, ‘to elect their
preferred candidates of choice.’ ” Ante, at 6.
While the pre-2006 version of the Act went well beyond protection
guaranteed under the Constitution, see Reno v. Bossier Parish
School Bd., 520 U. S. 471 –482 (1997), it now goes even
further.

															     It is, thus, quite
fitting that the Court repeatedly points out that this legislation
is “extraordinary” and “unprecedented” and
recognizes the significant constitutional problems created by
Congress’ decision to raise “the bar that covered
jurisdictions must clear,” even as “the conditions
justifying that requirement have dramatically improved.”
Ante, at 16–17. However one aggregates the data compiled by
Congress, it cannot justify the considerable burdens created by
§5. As the Court aptly notes: “[N]o one can fairly say
that [the record] shows anything approaching the
‘pervasive,’ ‘flagrant,’
‘widespread,’ and ‘rampant’ discrimination
that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the
covered jurisdictions from the rest of the Nation at that
time.” Ante, at 21. Indeed, circumstances in the covered
jurisdictions can no longer be characterized as
“exceptional” or “unique.”  “The
extensive pattern of discrimination that led the Court to
previously uphold §5 as enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment no
longer exists.” Northwest Austin, supra, at 226 (Thomas, J.,
concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Section 5
is, thus, unconstitutional.

															     While the Court claims
to “issue no holding on §5 itself,” ante, at 24,
its own opinion compellingly demonstrates that Congress has failed
to justify “ ‘current burdens’ ”
with a record demonstrating “ ‘current
needs.’ ” See ante, at 9 (quoting Northwest
Austin, supra, at 203). By leaving the inevitable conclusion
unstated, the Court needlessly prolongs the demise of that
provision. For the reasons stated in the Court’s opinion, I
would find §5 unconstitutional.
