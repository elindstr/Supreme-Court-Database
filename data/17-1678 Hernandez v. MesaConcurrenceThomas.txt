															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															JESUS C. HERNANDEZ, et al., PETITIONERS v. JESUS MESA, Jr.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[February 25, 2020]

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring.

															The Court correctly applies our precedents to conclude that the implied cause of action created in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,

403 U.S. 388 (1971), should not be extended to cross-border shootings.  I therefore join its opinion.

															I write separately because, in my view, the time has come to consider discarding the Bivens doctrine altogether.  The foundation for Bivens—the practice of creating implied causes of action in the statutory context—has already been abandoned.  And the Court has consistently refused to extend the Bivens doctrine for nearly 40 years, even going so far as to suggest that Bivens and its progeny were wrongly decided.  Stare decisis provides no “veneer of respectability to our continued application of [these] demonstrably incorrect precedents.”  Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  To ensure that we are not “perpetuat[ing] a usurpation of the legislative power,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 9), we should reevaluate our continued recognition of even a limited form of the Bivens doctrine.

															“ ‘Bivens is a relic of the heady days in which this Court assumed common-law powers to create causes of action.’ ”  Wilkie v. Robbins,

551 U.S. 537, 568 (2007) (Thomas, J., concurring) (quoting Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko,

534 U.S. 61, 75 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring)).  In the decade preceding Bivens, the Court believed that it had a duty “to be alert to provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective” Congress’ purposes in enacting a statute.  J. I. Case Co. v. Borak,

377 U.S. 426, 433 (1964).  Accordingly, the Court freely created implied private causes of action for damages under federal statutes.  See, e.g., Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc.,

396 U.S. 229, 239 (1969); Allen v. State Bd. of Elections,

393 U.S. 544, 557 (1969).

															This misguided approach to implied causes of action in the statutory context formed the backdrop of the Court’s decision in Bivens.  There, the Court held that federal officers who conducted a warrantless search and arrest in violation of the
 
Fourth Amendment could be sued for damages.  Bivens, 403 U. S., at 397.  The Court acknowledged that Congress had not provided a statutory cause of action for damages against federal officers and that “the
 
Fourth Amendment does not in so many words provide for its enforcement by an award of money damages.”  Id., at 396–397.  But it concluded, consistent with the then-prevailing understanding of implied causes of action in the statutory context, that federal courts could infer such a “remedial mechanism.”  Id., at 397 (citing Borak, 377 U. S., at 433).

															This holding “broke new ground.”  Ante, at 4.  From the ratification of the Bill of Rights until 1971, the Court did not create “implied private action[s] for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen’s constitutional rights.”  Malesko, 534 U. S., at 66.  Suits to recover such damages were generally brought under state tort law.  See Wheeldin v. Wheeler,

373 U.S. 647, 652 (1963).  Bivens thus opened the door to a new avenue for recovering damages from federal officers.  In the wake of that decision, the Court recognized an implied cause of action for damages against a Member of Congress accused of sex discrimination in violation of the
 
Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause, Davis v. Passman,

442 U.S. 228 (1979), and against prison officials accused of denying medical care in violation of the
 
Eighth Amendment’s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, Carlson v. Green,

446 U.S. 14 (1980).  Given this Court’s trend of creating implied causes of action, “there was a possibility that the Court would keep expanding Bivens until it became the substantial equivalent of

42 U. S. C. §1983.”  Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).

															The Court, however, eventually corrected course.  In the statutory context, the Court “retreated from [its] previous willingness to imply a cause of action where Congress has not provided one.”  Malesko, 534 U. S., at 67, n. 3.  After a series of decisions limiting courts’ discretion to create statutory causes of action, we renounced the Court’s freewheeling approach in Alexander v. Sandoval,

532 U.S. 275 (2001), explicitly repudiating the precedent used to support Bivens, 532 U. S., at 287 (abrogating Borak,

377 U. S. 426).  We explained that, “[l]ike substantive federal law itself, private rights of action to enforce federal law must be created by Congress.”  532 U. S., at 286.  “The judicial task is to interpret the statute Congress has passed to determine whether it displays an intent to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.”  Ibid.  Without such intent, “a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute.”  Id., at 286–287.

															The Court’s method of implying causes of action for damages in the statutory context provided the foundation for the approach taken in Bivens.  Therefore, as the Court backed away from creating statutory causes of action, it also effectively cabined the Bivens doctrine to the facts of Bivens, Davis, and Carlson.  For nearly 40 years, the Court has “ ‘consistently refused to extend Bivens liability to any new context or new category of defendants.’ ”  Abbasi, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (quoting Malesko, 534 U. S., at 68); see also ante, at 7.[1]*

															In doing so, our decisions have undermined the validity of the Bivens doctrine.  As the Court recognizes, “[w]e have stated that expansion of Bivens is a disfavored judicial activity.”  Ante, at 6–7 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And we have now repeatedly acknowledged the shaky foundation on which Bivens rests, stating that “in light of the changes to the Court’s general approach to recognizing implied damages remedies, it is possible that the analysis in the Court’s three Bivens cases might have been different if they were decided today.”  Abbasi, 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10–11); see also ante, at 7 (noting that it is “doubtful that we would have reached the same result” if Bivens were decided today).  Thus, it appears that we have already repudiated the foundation of the Bivens doctrine; nothing is left to do but overrule it.

															Our continued adherence to even a limited form of the Bivens doctrine appears to “perpetuat[e] a usurpation of the legislative power.”  Gamble, 587 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 9).  Federal courts lack the authority to engage in the distinctly legislative task of creating causes of action for damages to enforce federal positive law.  We have clearly recognized as much in the statutory context.  See supra, at 3.  I see no reason for us to take a different approach if the right asserted to recover damages derives from the Constitution, rather than from a federal statute.  Either way, we are exercising legislative power vested in Congress.  Cf. Carlson, 446 U. S., at 51 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (“The policy questions at issue in the creation of any tort remedies, constitutional or otherwise, involve judgments as to diverse factors that are more appropriately made by the legislature than by this Court in an attempt to fashion a constitutional common law”).

															This usurpation of legislative power is all the more troubling because Congress has demonstrated that it knows how to create a cause of action to recover damages for constitutional violations when it wishes to do so.  In

42 U. S. C. §1983, Congress provided a cause of action that allows persons to recover damages for certain deprivations of constitutional rights by state officers.  Congress has chosen not to provide such a cause of action against federal officers.  In fact, it has pre-empted the state tort suits that traditionally served as the mechanism by which damages were recovered from federal officers.

28 U. S. C. §2679(b); Minneci v. Pollard,

565 U.S. 118, 126 (2012).  “[I]t is not for us to fill any hiatus Congress has left in this area.”  Wheeldin, 373 U. S., at 652.

															*  *  *

															The analysis underlying Bivens cannot be defended.  We have cabined the doctrine’s scope, undermined its foundation, and limited its precedential value.  It is time to correct this Court’s error and abandon the doctrine altogether.
