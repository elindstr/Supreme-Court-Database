															[August 5, 2008]

															   Justice Souter, dissenting.

															   I joined the dissent in
Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. —,
— (2008) (Breyer, J., dissenting), and invoke the rule that
it is reasonable to adhere to a dissenting position throughout the
Term of Court in which it was announced. See North
Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 744
(1969) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The
only chance to apply the treaty provisions the dissent would have
held presently enforceable is now through action by the other
branches of the Government. A bill on the subject has been
introduced in the Congress, Avena Case Implementation Act of 2008,
H. R. 6481, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. (2008), and the Government
has represented to the International Court of Justice it will take
further steps to give effect to that court’s judgment
pertinent to Medellín’s conviction, among others,
Request for Interpretation of the Judgment of 31 March 2004 in
the Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v.
U. S.), 2008 I. C. J. No. 139, ¶ 37 (Order
of July 16). I would therefore enter the requested stay of
execution for as long as the remainder of the 2007 Term, to allow
for a current statement of the views of the Solicitor General and
for any congressional action that could affect the disposition of
petitioner’s filings. I would defer action on the petition
for a writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas,
the petition for an original writ of habeas corpus, and the motion
to recall and stay the mandate in Medellín v.
Texas, supra.
