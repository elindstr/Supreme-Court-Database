															 exhibits, it is, on consideration, ordered that it be referred to a special master, to be hereinafter designated, to ascertain and report to the Court:

															1. The amount of the public debt of the Commonwealth of Virginia on the first day of January, 1861, stating specifically how and in what form the same was evidenced, by what authority of law, and for what purposes the same was created, and the dates and nature of the bonds or other evidence of said indebtedness.

															2. The extent and value of the territory of Virginia and of West Virginia June 20, 1863, and the population thereof, with and without slaves, separately.

															3. All expenditures made by the Commonwealth of Virginia within the territory now constituting the State of West Virginia since any part of the debt was contracted.

															4. Such proportion of the ordinary expenses of the government of Virginia since any of said debt was contracted, as was properly assignable to the counties which were created into the State of West Virginia, on the basis of the average total population of Virginia, with and without slaves, as shown by the census of the United States.

															5. And also on the basis of the fair estimated valuation of the property, real and personal, by counties, of the State of Virginia.

															6. All moneys paid into the treasury of the commonwealth from the counties included within the State of West Virginia during the period prior to the admission of the latter state into the Union.

															7. The amount and value of all money, property, stocks, and credits which West Virginia received from the Commonwealth of Virginia, not embraced in any of the preceding items, and

															The answers to these inquiries to be without prejudice to any question in the cause.

															It is further ordered that the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of West Virginia shall each, when required, produce before the master, upon oath, all such records, books, papers, and public documents as may be in their possession or under their control, and which may, in his judgment, be pertinent to the said inquiries and accounts, or any of them.

															And the master is authorized to make, or cause to be made, such examination as he may deem desirable of the books of account, vouchers, documents, and public records of either state, relating to the inquiries he is herein directed to make, and to cause copies thereof or extracts therefrom to be made for use in making up his report.

															All public records published by authority of the Commonwealth of Virginia prior to the seventeenth day of April, 1861, and all papers and documents and other matter constituting parts of the public files and records of Virginia prior to the date aforesaid, which, in the judgment of the master, may be relevant and pertinent to any of said inquiries, or copies thereof, if duly authenticated, may be used in evidence and considered by the master, but all such evidence shall be subject to exceptions to its competency.  The public acts and records of the two states since the admission of West Virginia into the Union shall be evidence, if pertinent and duly authenticated, but all such evidence tendered by either party shall be subject to proper legal exceptions to its competency.

															The master is empowered to summon any persons whose testimony he or either party may deem to be material, and to cause their depositions to be taken before him, or by a notary public or other officer authorized to take the same, after reasonable notice to the adverse party.
