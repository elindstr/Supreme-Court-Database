															MERRICK B. GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL,
PETITIONER

															22–331v.

															FERNANDO CORDERO-GARCIA, aka FERNANDO
CORDERO

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 22, 2023]

															

															Justice Jackson, concurring.

															I agree with the Court that the Ninth Circuit
wrongly embraced a pending-proceeding requirement when it assessed
what types of prior offenses qualify as “offense[s] relating
to obstruction of justice” under 8 U. S. C.
§1101(a)(43)(S), for purposes of determining the
“aggravated felon[ies]” that render noncitizens
deportable, §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). This means, of course, that I
also agree with the Court’s conclusion that the Fourth
Circuit rightly rejected any such pending-proceeding
requirement.

															I write separately to highlight one (possibly
sufficient) reason why a predicate offense need not have a nexus to
a pending or ongoing investigation or judicial proceeding in order
to qualify as “an offense relating to obstruction of
justice” within the meaning of this immigration statute. The
reason is that, when Congress inserted the phrase “offense
relating to obstruction of justice” into
§1101(a)(43)(S), it might well have been referencing a
specific and previously designated category of offenses—the
offenses that are grouped together in Chapter 73 of Title 18 of the
U. S. Code, under the heading “Obstruction of
Justice.” 62 Stat. 769, codified at 18 U. S. C.
§1501 et seq. And not all of the offenses that are
addressed in Chapter 73 contain a pending-proceeding
requirement.

															*  *  *

															What counts as “an offense relating to
obstruction of justice” within the meaning of
§1101(a)(43)(S) is nothing more, or less, than what Congress
intended that phrase to mean when it enacted that statute. The
Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) “does not expressly
define” the phrase, so we apply the “normal tools of
statutory interpretation” to “ ‘see what
Congress probably meant’ ” by it.
Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, 581 U.S. 385, 391
(2017) (quoting Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.S.
47, 53 (2006)). In my view, our job in this regard is a limited
one: We are called upon to understand and implement whatever
Congress meant by that unadorned phrase.

															When Congress selected the words “offense
relating to obstruction of justice” and inserted them into
the INA in 1996, 110 Stat. 1277–1278, Congress’s
longest standing and most significant use of the phrase
“obstruction of justice” in the Statutes at Large was
its description of Chapter 73 of Title 18 as concerning
“obstruction of justice.” 62 Stat. 769; see also 104
Stat. 4861 (describing Chapter 73 as “relating to obstruction
of justice” when adding an offense to that Chapter in 1990).
To me, this is a powerful contextual clue that Congress may have
simply—and solely—been drawing on its own existing
understanding of which particular offenses are properly
characterized as such. Accord, Flores v. Attorney
General, 856 F.3d 280, 287–289 (CA3 2017) (refusing to
“look beyond Chapter 73” to “determine whether an
alien’s prior offense ‘relat[es] to obstruction of
justice’ ” because §1101(a)(43)(S)’s
“text . . . indicates Congress’s intention to
reference Chapter 73”). In deciding the cases before us, I
would not want to rule out (even inadvertently) the possibility
that Chapter 73 is Congress’s actual benchmark with respect
to what qualifies as an “offense relating to obstruction of
justice” for §1101(a)(43)(S) purposes, rather than just
a mere clue to some platonic, judicially divined meaning of
Congress’s chosen words.

															I believe that hewing closely to
Congress’s will in this regard is especially important where
(as here) making the determination of which offenses qualify
implicates the “drastic” deportation sanction.
Jordan v. De George, 341 U.S.
223, 231 (1951). In our constitutional system, the Legislature
makes legal policy judgments regarding the particular circumstances
that trigger the consequences that are associated with criminal
convictions. Accord, United States v. Lanier,
520 U.S.
259, 265, and n. 5 (1997). And it seems at least plausible that
Congress’s description of certain “aggravated
felon[ies],” §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as “offense[s]
relating to obstruction of justice,” §1101(a)(43)(S),
may embody its judgment to peg that subset of aggravated felonies
to Chapter 73, not an intent to leave the category without form for
future judicial refinement. Of course, if Congress has
already thus decided which obstruction-related convictions so
trigger the INA’s aggravated-felony provision, this Court
need not, and indeed should not, cobble together a
“generic” offense definition from nonstatutory sources
(which risks sweeping in offenses that Congress did not mean to
capture).

															Here, the Court correctly emphasizes Chapter
73’s importance in the course of analyzing whether a possible
predicate offense must have a nexus to a pending proceeding in
order to qualify as an aggravated felony. Ante, at 4. But
these parties have not fully ventilated the arguments for and
against the possibility that Chapter 73 might define (in substance)
the universe of offenses that “relat[e] to obstruction of
justice,” §1101(a)(43)(S), as Congress meant that phrase
to be interpreted. Nor would running that issue to ground here
change the outcome.[1] As the
Court notes, multiple Chapter 73 offenses require no pending
proceeding. §1512(f ); see also 102 Stat. 4397–4398
(1988 Congress describing an amendment to §1512 as an
“obstruction of justice amendmen[t]” (boldface
deleted)). That suffices to resolve the question before us even
under a Chapter 73-focused approach. The issue of whether such an
approach best tracks Congress’s intent can be reserved for
future consideration in a case where the parties joust in earnest
on the question.

Notes
1
Before this Court, Pugin did
not root his arguments in the Chapter 73-focused paradigm that I
sketch here. I agree with the Court that the arguments he
did make do not require reversing the Fourth
Circuit.
