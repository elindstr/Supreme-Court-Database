															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 13–502

															_________________

															CLYDE REED, et al., PETITIONERS v.
TOWN OF GILBERT, ARIZONA, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 18, 2015]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Sotomayor join, concurring.

															I join the opinion of the Court but add a few
words of further explanation.

															As the Court holds, what we have termed
“content-based” laws must satisfy strict scrutiny.
Content-based laws merit this protection because they present,
albeit sometimes in a subtler form, the same dangers as laws that
regulate speech based on viewpoint. Limiting speech based on its
“topic” or “subject” favors those who do
not want to disturb the status quo. Such regulations may interfere
with democratic self-government and the search for truth. See
Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv.
Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 537 (1980) .

															As the Court shows, the regulations at issue in
this case are replete with content-based distinctions, and as a
result they must satisfy strict scrutiny. This does not mean,
however, that municipalities are powerless to enact and enforce
reasonable sign regulations. I will not attempt to provide anything
like a comprehensive list, but here are some rules that would not
be content based:

															Rules regulating the size of signs. These rules
may distinguish among signs based on any content-neutral criteria,
including any relevant criteria listed below.

															Rules regulating the locations in which signs
may be placed. These rules may distinguish between free-standing
signs and those attached to buildings.

															Rules distinguishing between lighted and
unlighted signs.

															Rules distinguishing between signs with fixed
messages and electronic signs with messages that change.

															Rules that distinguish between the placement of
signs on private and public property.

															Rules distinguishing between the placement of
signs on commercial and residential property.

															Rules distinguishing between on-premises and
off-premises signs.

															Rules restricting the total number of signs
allowed per mile of roadway.

															Rules imposing time restrictions on signs
advertising a one-time event. Rules of this nature do not
discriminate based on topic or subject and are akin to rules
restricting the times within which oral speech or music is
allowed.[1]*

															In addition to regulating signs put up by
private actors, government entities may also erect their own signs
consistent with the principles that allow governmental speech. See
Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U. S. 460
–469 (2009). They may put up all manner of signs to promote
safety, as well as directional signs and signs pointing out
historic sites and scenic spots.

															Properly understood, today’s decision will
not prevent cities from regulating signs in a way that fully
protects public safety and serves legitimate esthetic
objectives.

Notes
1
* Of course,
content-neutral restrictions on speech are not necessarily
consistent with the First Amendment. Time, place, and manner
restrictions “must be narrowly tailored to serve the
government’s legitimate, content-neutral interests.”
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 798
(1989) . But they need not meet the high standard imposed on
viewpoint- and content-based restrictions.
