															ROB BONTA, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA

															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[July 1, 2021]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring in Parts I, II–A, II–B–2, and III, and concurring in the judgment.

															I am pleased to join most of The Chief Justice’s opinion.  In particular, I agree that the exacting scrutiny standard drawn from our election-law jurisprudence has real teeth.  It requires both narrow tailoring and consideration of alternative means of obtaining the sought-after information.  See ante, at 9–11, 14–15 (opinion of the Court).  For the reasons The Chief Justice explains, California’s blunderbuss approach to charitable disclosures fails exacting scrutiny and is facially unconstitutional.  See ante, at 12–19 (opinion of the Court).  The question is not even close.  And for the same reasons, California’s approach necessarily fails strict scrutiny.

															The Chief Justice would hold that the particular exacting scrutiny standard in our election-law jurisprudence applies categorically “to
 
First Amendment challenges to compelled disclosure.”  Ante, at 7 (plurality opinion).  Justice Thomas, by contrast, would hold that strict scrutiny applies in all such cases.  See ante, at 1–2 (concurring opinion).  I am not prepared at this time to hold that a single standard applies to all disclosure requirements.  And I do not read our cases to have broadly resolved the question in favor of exacting scrutiny.  This Court decided its seminal compelled disclosure cases before it developed modern strict scrutiny doctrine.  See Fallon, Strict Judicial Scrutiny, 54 UCLA L. Rev. 1267, 1284 (2007) (“Before 1960, what we would now call strict judicial scrutiny . . . did not exist”); id., at 1282 (contending that modern strict scrutiny’s “first unambiguous appearance” in a majority opinion occurred in 1969).  Accordingly, nothing in those cases can be understood as rejecting strict scrutiny.  If anything, their language and reasoning—requiring a compelling interest and a minimally intrusive means of advancing that interest—anticipated and is fully in accord with contemporary strict scrutiny doctrine.  See, e.g., Shelton v. Tucker,

364 U.S. 479, 488 (1960) (the government’s purpose “cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved”); NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,

357 U.S. 449, 463 (1958) (requiring a “compelling” interest (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Similarly, Buckley v. Valeo,

424 U.S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), and its progeny should not be read to have broadly cabined our earlier decisions merely by relying on them in one particular context.

															Because the choice between exacting and strict scrutiny has no effect on the decision in these cases, I see no need to decide which standard should be applied here or whether the same level of scrutiny should apply in all cases in which the compelled disclosure of associations is challenged under the
 
First Amendment.
