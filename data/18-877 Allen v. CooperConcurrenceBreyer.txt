															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															FREDERICK L. ALLEN, et al., PETITIONERS v. ROY A. COOPER, III, GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[March 23, 2020]

															

															Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring in the judgment.

															The Constitution gives Congress certain enumerated powers.  One of them is set forth in the Intellectual Property Clause: Congress may “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.”  Art. I, §8, cl. 8.  “And the monopoly rights so given,” the Court acknowledges, operate against “States no less than private parties.”  Ante, at 6.  States, in other words, have “a specific duty” not to infringe that “is assigned by law” and upon which “individual rights depend.”  Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 166 (1803).  One might therefore expect that someone injured by a State’s violation of that duty could “resort to the laws of his country for a remedy,” ibid., especially where, as here, Congress has sought to provide one.  Or more concretely, one might think that Walt Disney Pictures could sue a State (or anyone else) for hosting an unlicensed screening of the studio’s 2003 blockbuster film, Pirates of the Caribbean (or any one of its many sequels).

															Yet the Court holds otherwise.  In its view, Congress’ power under the Intellectual Property Clause cannot support a federal law providing that, when proven to have pirated intellectual property, States must pay for what they plundered.  Ante, at 6–10.  To subject nonconsenting States to private suits for copyright or patent infringement, says the Court, Congress must endeavor to pass a more “tailored statute” than the one before us, relying not on the Intellectual Property Clause, but on §5 of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment.  Ante, at 16.  Whether a future legislative effort along those lines will pass constitutional muster is anyone’s guess.  But faced with the risk of unfairness to authors and inventors alike, perhaps Congress will venture into this great constitutional unknown.

															That our sovereign-immunity precedents can be said to call for so uncertain a voyage suggests that something is amiss.  Indeed, we went astray in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,

517 U.S. 44 (1996), as I have consistently maintained.  See College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,

527 U.S. 666, 699–701 (1999) (dissenting opinion); Federal Maritime Comm’n v. South Carolina Ports Authority,

535 U.S. 743, 787–788 (2002) (same).  We erred again in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank,

527 U.S. 627 (1999), by holding that Congress exceeded its §5 powers when it passed a patent counterpart to the copyright statute at issue here.  See id., at 652–664 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  But recognizing that my longstanding view has not carried the day, and that the Court’s decision in Florida Prepaid controls this case, I concur in the judgment.  See ante, 9–10, 15–16; Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC,

576 U.S. 446, 455–456 (2015); Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Breyer, J., dissenting).
