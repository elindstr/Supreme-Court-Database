															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–138

															_________________

															BILLY RAYMOND COUNTERMAN, PETITIONER v.
COLORADO

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals
of colorado

															[June 27, 2023]

															

															Justice Thomas, dissenting.

															I join Justice Barrett’s dissent in full.
I write separately to address the majority’s surprising and
misplaced reliance on New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S.
254 (1964). In New York Times, this Court held that the
First Amendment bars public figures from recovering damages for
defamation unless they can show that the statement at issue was
made with “ ‘actual malice’—that is,
with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of
whether it was false or not.” Id., at 280. Like the
majority’s decision today, “New York Times and
the Court’s decisions extending it were policy-driven
decisions masquerading as constitutional law.” McKee
v. Cosby, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J.,
concurring in denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 2). Instead of
simply applying the First Amendment as it was understood at the
time of the Founding, “the Court fashioned its own
‘ “federal rule[s]” ’ by
balancing the ‘competing values at stake in defamation
suits.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Gertz v.
Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S.
323, 334, 348 (1974)); see also Bose Corp. v.
Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S.
485, 501–502 (1984) (acknowledging that “the rule
enunciated in the New York Times case” is
“largely a judge-made rule of law,” the
“content” of which is “given meaning through the
evolutionary process of common-law adjudication”). “The
constitutional libel rules adopted by this Court in New York
Times and its progeny broke sharply from the common law of
libel, and there are sound reasons to question whether the First
and Fourteenth Amendments displaced this body of common law.”
McKee, 586 U. S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip
op., at 6). Thus, as I have previously noted, “[w]e should
reconsider our jurisprudence in this area.” Id., at
___ (slip op., at 14); see also Berisha v. Lawson,
594 U. S. ___ (2021) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of
certiorari).

															I am far from alone. Many Members of this Court
have questioned the soundness of New York Times and its
numerous extensions. See, e.g., Berisha, 594
U. S., at ___–___ (Gorsuch, J., dissenting from denial
of certiorari) (slip op., at 5–8); Coughlin v.
Westinghouse Broadcasting & Cable, Inc., 476 U.S.
1187 (1986) (Burger, C. J., joined by Rehnquist, J.,
dissenting from denial of certiorari); Gertz, 418
U. S., at 370 (White, J., dissenting); Rosenbloom v.
Metromedia, Inc., 403 U.S.
29, 62 (1971) (Harlan, J., dissenting); id., at 78
(Marshall, J., dissenting); Rosenblatt v. Baer,
383 U.S.
75, 92 (1966) (Stewart, J., concurring); see also E. Kagan, A
Libel Story: Sullivan Then and Now, 18 L. & Soc. Inquiry
197, 207 (1993); J. Lewis & B. Ottley, New York Times v.
Sullivan at 50, 64 DePaul L. Rev. 1, 35–36 (2014)
(collecting statements from Justice Scalia); cf. Tah v.
Global Witness Publishing, Inc., 991 F.3d 231, 251–256
(CADC 2021) (Silberman, J., dissenting in part) (questioning the
doctrine). It is thus unfortunate that the majority chooses not
only to prominently and uncritically invoke New York Times,
but also to extend its flawed, policy-driven First Amendment
analysis to true threats, a separate area of this Court’s
jurisprudence.
