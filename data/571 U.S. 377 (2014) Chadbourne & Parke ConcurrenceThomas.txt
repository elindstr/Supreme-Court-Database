court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[February 26, 2014]

															

															     Justice Thomas,
concurring.

															     I join the opinion of
the Court on the understanding that the “misrepresentation[s]
. . . of . . . material fact” alleged in
this case are not properly considered “in connection
with” transactions in covered securities. 15
U. S. C. §78bb(f)(1)(A). We have said that the
statutory phrase “in connection with” warrants a
“broad interpretation,” Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
& Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U. S. 71, 85 (2006) , though not so
broad as to reach any “common-law fraud that happens to
involve securities,” see SECv. Zandford, 535 U. S. 813, 820
(2002) . Considered in isolation, however, that phrase “is
essentially ‘indeterminat[e]’ because connections, like
relations, ‘stop nowhere.’ ” Maracich v.
Spears, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9) (some
internal quotation marks omitted). The phrase thus “provides
little guidance without a limiting principle consistent with the
structure of the statute and its other provisions.” Ibid. As
I understand it, the opinion of the Court resolves this case by
applying a limiting principle to the phrase “in connection
with” that is “consistent with the statutory framework
and design” of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards
Act of 1998, id., at ___ (slip op., at 10), and also consistent
with our precedents.
