ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS
OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY
Syllabus 

															Decided on authority of Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, ante, p.  219 U. S. 186.

															The facts are stated in the opinion.

															MR. JUSTICE LURTON delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The facts are not substantially different, and the judgment of the court of Appeals of the State of Kentucky is affirmed upon the authority of that case.

															Affirmed.
