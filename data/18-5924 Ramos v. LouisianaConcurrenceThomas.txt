															EVANGELISTO RAMOS, PETITIONER v. LOUISIANA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of louisiana, fourth circuit

															[April 20, 2020]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

															I agree with the Court that petitioner Evangelisto Ramos’ felony conviction by a nonunanimous jury was unconstitutional.  I write separately because I would resolve this case based on the Court’s longstanding view that the
 
Sixth Amendment includes a protection against nonunanimous felony guilty verdicts, without undertaking a fresh analysis of the meaning of “trial . . . by an impartial jury.”  I also would make clear that this right applies against the States through the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment, not the Due Process Clause.

															I

															I begin with the parties’ dispute as to whether the
 
Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury includes a protection against nonunanimous felony guilty verdicts.  On this question, I do not write on a blank slate.  As the Court acknowledges, our decisions have long recognized that unanimity is required.  See ante, at 6–7.  Because this interpretation is not demonstrably erroneous, I would resolve the
 
Sixth Amendment question on that basis.

															A

															This Court first decided that the
 
Sixth Amendment protected a right to unanimity in Thompson v. Utah,

170 U.S. 343 (1898).  The Court reasoned that Thompson, a Utah prisoner, was protected by the
 
Sixth Amendment when Utah was still a Territory because “the right of trial by jury in suits at common law appl[ied] to the Territories of the United States.”  Id., at 346.  The Court then stated that this right “made it impossible to deprive him of his liberty except by [a] unanimous verdict.”  Id., at 355; see also id., at 351, 353.

															The Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the
 
Sixth Amendment’s unanimity requirement.  In Patton v. United States,

281 U.S. 276 (1930), the Court stated that the
 
Sixth Amendment protects the right “that the verdict should be unanimous,” id., at 288.  In Andres v. United States,

333 U.S. 740 (1948), the Court repeated that “[u]nanimity in jury verdicts is required” by the
 
Sixth Amendment, id., at 748.  And in Apodaca v. Oregon,

406 U.S. 404 (1972), five Justices agreed that “the
 
Sixth Amendment’s guarantee of trial by jury embraces a guarantee that the verdict of the jury must be unanimous,” id., at 414 (Stewart, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., dissenting); see also Johnson v. Louisiana,

406 U.S. 356, 371 (1972) (Powell, J., concurring) (explaining views in Apodaca and its companion case); id., at 382–383 (Douglas, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., dissenting) (same).  We have accepted this interpretation of the
 
Sixth Amendment in recent cases.  See Southern Union Co. v. United States,

567 U.S. 343, 356 (2012); Blakely v. Washington,

542 U.S. 296, 301 (2004); Apprendi v. New Jersey,

530 U.S. 466, 477 (2000).

															B

															The question then becomes whether these decisions are entitled to stare decisis effect.  As I have previously explained, “the Court’s typical formulation of the stare decisis standard does not comport with our judicial duty under Article III because it elevates demonstrably erroneous decisions—meaning decisions outside the realm of permissible interpretation—over the text of the Constitution and other duly enacted federal law.”  Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (concurring opinion) (slip op., at 2).  There is considerable evidence that the phrase “trial . . . by . . . jury” in the
 
Sixth Amendment was understood since the founding to require that a felony guilty verdict be unanimous.  Because our precedents are thus not outside the realm of permissible interpretation, I will apply them.

															1

															Blackstone—“the preeminent authority on English law for the founding generation,” Alden v. Maine,

527 U.S. 706, 715 (1999)—wrote that no subject can “be affected either in his property, his liberty, or his person, but by the unanimous consent” of a jury, 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 379 (1772); see also 4 id., at 343.  Another influential treatise author, Hale, wrote that “the law of England hath afforded the best method of trial, that is possible, . . . namely by a jury . . . all concurring in the same judgment.”  1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 33 (1736) (emphasis deleted).  Such views continued in scholarly works throughout the early Republic.  See, e.g., 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §777, p. 248 (1833); 6 N. Dane, Digest of American Law, ch. LXXXII, Art. 2, §1, p. 226 (1824); 2 J. Wilson, Works of the Honourable James Wilson 349–350 (1804).

															The uniform practice among the States was in accord.  Despite isolated 17th-century colonial practices allowing nonunanimous juries, “unanimity became the accepted rule during the 18th century, as Americans became more familiar with the details of English common law and adopted those details in their own colonial legal systems.”  Apodaca, supra, at 408, n. 3 (plurality opinion).  In the founding era, six States explicitly mentioned unanimity in their constitutions.  See Del. Declaration of Rights §14 (1776); Md. Declaration of Rights, Art. XIX (1776); N. C. Declaration of Rights §IX (1776); Pa. Declaration of Rights, Art. IX (1776); Vt. Const., Art. XI (1786); Va. Declaration of Rights §8 (1776).  Four more States clearly referred to the common-law jury right, which included unanimity.  Ky. Const., Art. XII, §6 (1792); N. J. Const., Art. XXII (1776); N. Y. Const., Art. XLI (1777); S. C. Const., Art. IX, §6 (1790).  Some States did not explicitly refer to either the common law or unanimity.  See, e.g., Ga. Const., Art. LXI (1777); Mass. Declaration of Rights, Art. XII (1780).  But there is reason to believe that they nevertheless understood unanimity to be required.  See, e.g., Rouse v. State, 4 Ga. 136, 147 (1848).

															In light of the express language used in some State Constitutions, respondent Louisiana argues that the omission of an express unanimity requirement in the
 
Sixth Amendment reflects a deliberate choice.  This argument fails to establish that the Court’s decisions are demonstrably erroneous.  The House of Representatives passed a version of the amendment providing that “[t]he trial of all crimes . . . shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the vicinage, with the requisite of unanimity for conviction, of the right of challenge, and other accustomed requisites,” 1 Annals of Cong. 435 (1789), but the final Amendment contained no reference to vicinage or unanimity.  See Amdt. 6.  I agree with Justice Harlan and the Court that “the meaning of this change is wholly speculative” and that there is “no concrete evidence” that the Senate rejected the requirement of unanimity.  Baldwin v. New York,

399 U.S. 66, 123, n. 9 (1970) (Harlan, J., dissenting); see also ante, at 11–12; Letter from J. Madison to E. Pendleton (Sept. 14, 1789), in 1 Letters and Other Writings of James Madison 491 (1867).  There is thus sufficient evidence to support this Court’s prior interpretation that the
 
Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury requires unanimity.

															2

															There is also considerable evidence that this understanding persisted up to the time of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment’s ratification.  State courts, for example, continued to interpret the phrase “trial by jury” to require unanimity in felony guilty verdicts.  The New Hampshire Superior Court of Judicature expounded on the point:

															“The terms ‘jury,’ and ‘trial by jury,’ are, and for ages have been well known in the language of the law.  They were used at the adoption of the constitution, and always, it is believed, before that time, and almost always since, in a single sense.

															“A jury for the trial of a cause . . . must return their unanimous verdict upon the issue submitted to them.

															“All the books of the law describe a trial jury substantially as we have stated it.  And a ‘trial by jury’ is a trial by such a body, so constituted and conducted.  So far as our knowledge extends, these expressions were used at the adoption of the constitution and always before, in these senses alone by all classes of writers and speakers.”  Opinion of Justices, 41 N. H. 550, 551–552 (1860).

															Other state courts held the same view.  The Missouri Supreme Court in 1860 called unanimity one of the “essential requisites in a jury trial,” Vaughn v. Scade, 30 Mo. 600, 603, and the Ohio Supreme Court in 1853 called it one of “the essential and distinguishing features of the trial by jury, as known at common law, and generally, if not universally, adopted in this country,” Work v. State, 2 Ohio St. 296, 306.

															Treatises from the Reconstruction era likewise adopted this position.  A leading work on criminal procedure explained that if a “statute authorizes [a jury] to find a verdict upon anything short of . . . unanimous consent,” it “is void.”  1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure §761, p. 532 (1866).  A widely read treatise on constitutional law reiterated that “ ‘by a jury’ is generally understood to mean” a body that “must unanimously concur in the guilt of the accused before a conviction can be had.”  G. Paschal, The Constitution of the United States 210 (1876) (capitalization omitted).  And a volume on the jury trial was in agreement.  See J. Proffatt, Trial by Jury §77, p. 112 (1877).

															*  *  *

															Based on this evidence, the Court’s prior interpretation of the
 
Sixth Amendment’s guarantee is not demonstrably erroneous.  It is within the realm of permissible interpretations to say that “trial . . . by . . . jury” in that Amendment includes a protection against nonunanimous felony guilty verdicts.

															II

															The remaining question is whether that right is protected against the States.  In my view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause provides this protection.  I do not adhere to this Court’s decisions applying due process incorporation, including Apodaca and—it seems—the Court’s opinion in this case.

															The Privileges or Immunities Clause provides that “[n]o State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.”  Amdt. 14, §1.  At the time of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment’s ratification, “the terms ‘privileges’ and ‘immunities’ had an established meaning as synonyms of ‘rights.’ ”  McDonald v. Chicago,

561 U.S. 742, 813 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  “[T]he ratifying public understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights” against abridgment by the States.  Id., at 837.  The
 
Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury is certainly a constitutionally enumerated right.  See Maxwell v. Dow,

176 U.S. 581, 606–608 (1900) (Harlan, J., dissenting).

															The Court, however, has made the Due Process Clause serve the function that the Privileges or Immunities Clause should serve.  Although the Privileges or Immunities Clause grants “United States citizens a certain collection of rights—i.e., privileges or immunities—attributable to that status,” the Court has interpreted the Clause “quite narrowly.”  McDonald, 561 U. S., at 808 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  Perhaps to compensate for this limited view of the Privileges or Immunities Clause, it has incorporated individual rights against the States through the Due Process Clause.  Id., at 809.

															Due process incorporation is a demonstrably erroneous interpretation of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment.  As I have explained before, “[t]he notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only ‘process’ before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the most casual user of words.”  Id., at 811.  The unreasonableness of this interpretation is underscored by the Court’s struggle to find a “guiding principle to distinguish ‘fundamental’ rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental rights that do not,” ibid., as well as its many incorrect decisions based on this theory, see Obergefell v. Hodges,

576 U.S. 644 (2015); Roe v. Wade,

410 U.S. 113 (1973); Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857). 

															I “decline to apply the legal fiction” of due process incorporation.  Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted).  As a result, I part ways with the Court on both its affirmative argument about the
 
Fourteenth Amendment and its treatment of Apodaca, in which five Justices agreed the
 
Sixth Amendment included a right to unanimity but a different majority concluded that the right did not apply to the States.  See ante, at 7–11.

															I would accept petitioner’s invitation to decide this case under the Privileges or Immunities Clause.  The Court conspicuously avoids saying which clause it analyzes.  See, e.g., ante, at 3, 7.  But one assumes from its silence that the Court is either following our due process incorporation precedents or believes that “nothing in this case turns on” which clause applies, Timbs, supra, at ___ (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1).  

															I have already rejected our due process incorporation cases as demonstrably erroneous, and I fundamentally disagree with applying that theory of incorporation simply because it reaches the same result in the case before us.  Close enough is for horseshoes and hand grenades, not constitutional interpretation.  The textual difference between protecting “citizens” (in the Privileges or Immunities Clause) and “person[s]” (in the Due Process Clause) will surely be relevant in another case.  And our judicial duty—not to mention the candor we owe to our fellow citizens—requires us to put an end to this Court’s due process prestidigitation, which no one is willing to defend on the merits.

															I would simply hold that, because all of the opinions in Apodaca addressed the Due Process Clause, its
 
Fourteenth Amendment ruling does not bind us because the proper question here is the scope of the Privileges or Immunities Clause.  I cannot understand why the Court, having decided to abandon Apodaca, refuses to correctly root its holding in the Privileges or Immunities Clause.[1]

															III

															There is no need to prove the original meaning of the   

															
 
Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury in this case.[2]  The evidence that I have recounted is enough to establish that our previous interpretations of the
 
Sixth Amendment are not demonstrably erroneous.  What is necessary, however, is a clear understanding of the means by which the
 
Sixth Amendment right applies against the States.  We should rely on the Privileges or Immunities Clause, not the Due Process Clause or the
 
Fourteenth Amendment in some vague sense.  Accordingly, I concur only in the judgment.
Notes
1
 I also note that, under my approach to stare decisis, there is no need to decide which reliance interests are important enough to save an incorrect precedent.  I doubt that this question is susceptible of principled resolution in this case, compare ante, at 22–26 (principal opinion), with ante, at 3 (Sotomayor, J., concurring); ante, at 15–17 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring); and post, at 19–26 (Alito, J., dissenting), or in any other case for that matter, see, e.g., Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC,

576 U.S. 446, 457–458 (2015); Lawrence v. Texas,

539 U.S. 558, 577 (2003); Dickerson v. United States,

530 U.S. 428, 443 (2000); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,

505 U.S. 833, 855–856 (1992).

 Similarly, I express no view on how fundamental the right to unanimity is, what other attributes of a criminal jury are protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause, what rights are protected in misdemeanor cases, or what rights are protected in civil trials.
