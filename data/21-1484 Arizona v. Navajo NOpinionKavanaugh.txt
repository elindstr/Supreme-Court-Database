															on writs of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 22, 2023]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															In 1848, the United States won the
Mexican-American War and acquired vast new territory from Mexico in
what would become the American West. The Navajos lived within a
discrete portion of that expansive and newly American territory.
For the next two decades, however, the United States and the
Navajos periodically waged war against one another. In 1868, the
United States and the Navajos agreed to a peace treaty. In exchange
for the Navajos’ promise not to engage in further war, the
United States established a large reservation for the Navajos in
their original homeland in the western United States. Under the
1868 treaty, the Navajo Reservation includes (among other things)
the land, the minerals below the land’s surface, and the
timber on the land, as well as the right to use needed water on the
reservation.

															The question in this suit concerns
“reserved water rights”—a shorthand for the water
rights implicitly reserved to accomplish the purpose of the
reservation. Cappaert v. United States, 426
U.S. 128, 138 (1976); see also Winters v. United
States, 207 U.S.
564, 576–577 (1908). The Navajos’ claim is not that
the United States has interfered with their water access.
Instead, the Navajos contend that the treaty requires the United
States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the
Navajos—for example, by assessing the Tribe’s water
needs, developing a plan to secure the needed water, and
potentially building pipelines, pumps, wells, or other water
infrastructure—either to facilitate better access to water on
the reservation or to transport off-reservation water onto the
reservation. In light of the treaty’s text and history, we
conclude that the treaty does not require the United States to take
those affirmative steps. And it is not the Judiciary’s role
to rewrite and update this 155-year-old treaty. Rather, Congress
and the President may enact—and often have enacted—laws
to assist the citizens of the western United States, including the
Navajos, with their water needs.

															I

															The Navajo Tribe is one of the largest in the
United States, with more than 300,000 enrolled members, roughly
170,000 of whom live on the Navajo Reservation. The Navajo
Reservation is the geographically largest in the United States,
spanning more than 17 million acres across the States of Arizona,
New Mexico, and Utah. To put it in perspective, the Navajo
Reservation is about the size of West Virginia.

															Two treaties between the United States and the
Navajo Tribe led to the establishment of the Navajo Reservation.
After the Mexican-American War ended in 1848, the United States
acquired control over massive new territory throughout what is now
the western United States—spanning west from Texas through
New Mexico and Arizona to California, and north into Oklahoma,
Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada. The Navajos lived in a
portion of that formerly Mexican territory.

															In 1849, the United States entered into a treaty
with the Navajos. See Treaty Between the United States of America
and the Navajo Tribe of Indians, Sept. 9, 1849, 9 Stat. 974
(ratified Sept. 24, 1850). In that 1849 treaty, the Navajo Tribe
recognized that the Navajos were now within the jurisdiction of the
United States, and the Navajos agreed to cease hostilities and to
maintain “perpetual peace” with the United States.
Ibid. In return, the United States agreed to
“designate, settle, and adjust” the
“boundaries” of the Navajo territory. Id., at
975.

															Over the next two decades, however, the United
States and the Navajos often were at war with one another. During
that period, the United States forcibly moved many Navajos from
their original homeland to a relatively barren area in New Mexico
known as the Bosque Redondo Reservation.

															In 1868, the two sides agreed to a second treaty
to put an end to “all war between the parties.” The
United States “set apart” a large reservation
“for the use and occupation of the Navajo tribe” within
the new American territory in the western United States. Treaty
Between the United States of America and the Navajo Tribe of
Indians, June 1, 1868, 15 Stat. 667–668 (ratified Aug. 12,
1868). Importantly, the reservation would be on the Navajos’
original homeland, not the Bosque Redondo Reservation. The new
reservation would enable the Navajos to once again become
self-sufficient, a substantial improvement from the situation at
Bosque Redondo. The United States also agreed (among other things)
to build schools, a chapel, and other buildings; to provide
teachers for at least 10 years; to supply seeds and agricultural
implements for up to three years; and to provide funding for the
purchase of sheep, goats, cattle, and corn.

															In “consideration of the advantages and
benefits conferred” on the Navajos by the United States in
the 1868 treaty, the Navajos pledged not to engage in further war
against the United States or other Indian tribes. Id., at
669–670. The Navajos also agreed to “relinquish all
right to occupy any territory outside their
reservation”—with the exception of certain rights to
hunt. Id., at 670. The Navajos promised to “make the
reservation” their “permanent home.” Id.,
at 671. In short, the treaty enabled the Navajos to live on their
original land. See Treaty Between the United States of America and
the Navajo Tribe of Indians With a Record of the Discussions That
Led to Its Signing 2, 4, 10–11, 15 (1968).

															Under the 1868 treaty, the Navajo Reservation
includes not only the land within the boundaries of the
reservation, but also water rights. Under this Court’s
longstanding reserved water rights doctrine, sometimes referred to
as the Winters doctrine, the Federal Government’s
reservation of land for an Indian tribe also implicitly reserves
the right to use needed water from various sources—such as
groundwater, rivers, streams, lakes, and springs—that arise
on, border, cross, underlie, or are encompassed within the
reservation. See Winters v. United States, 207 U.S.
564, 576–577 (1908); see also Cappaert v.
United States, 426
U.S. 128, 138–139, 143 (1976); Arizona v.
California, 373 U.S.
546, 598–600 (1963); F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian
Law §19.03(2)(a), pp. 1212–1213 (N. Newton ed.
2012). Under the Winters doctrine, the Federal Government
reserves water only “to the extent needed to accomplish the
purpose of the reservation.” Sturgeon v. Frost,
587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 13) (internal
quotation marks omitted); United States v. New
Mexico, 438 U.S.
696, 700–702 (1978).

															The Navajo Reservation lies almost entirely
within the Colorado River Basin, and three vital rivers—the
Colorado, the Little Colorado, and the San Juan—border the
reservation. To meet their water needs for household, agricultural,
industrial, and commercial purposes, the Navajos obtain water from
rivers, tributaries, springs, lakes, and aquifers on the
reservation.

															Much of the western United States is arid. Water
has long been scarce, and the problem is getting worse. From 2000
through 2022, the region faced the driest 23-year period in more
than a century and one of the driest periods in the last 1,200
years. And the situation is expected to grow more severe in future
years. So even though the Navajo Reservation encompasses numerous
water sources and the Tribe has the right to use needed water from
those sources, the Navajos face the same water scarcity problem
that many in the western United States face.

															Over the decades, the Federal Government has
taken various steps to assist the people in the western States with
their water needs. The Solicitor General explains that, for the
Navajo Tribe in particular, the Federal Government has secured
hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of water and authorized billions
of dollars for water infrastructure on the Navajo Reservation. See
Tr. of Oral Arg. 5; see also, e.g., Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116–260, 134 Stat. 3227,
3230; Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Projects Act,
§§10402, 10609, 10701, 123 Stat. 1372, 1395–1397;
Central Arizona Project Settlement Act of 2004, §104, 118
Stat. 3487; Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 2000, 114
Stat. 2763A–261, 2763A–263; Act of June 13, 1962, 76
Stat. 96; Act of Apr. 19, 1950, 64 Stat. 44–45.

															In the Navajos’ view, however, those
efforts did not fully satisfy the United States’s obligations
under the 1868 treaty. The Navajos therefore sued the U. S.
Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other
federal parties. As relevant here, the Navajos asserted a
breach-of-trust claim arising out of the 1868 treaty and sought to
“compel the Federal Defendants to determine the water
required to meet the needs” of the Navajos in Arizona and to
“devise a plan to meet those needs.” App. 86. The
States of Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado intervened against the
Tribe to protect those States’ interests in water from the
Colorado River.

															According to the Navajos, the United States must
do more than simply not interfere with the reserved water
rights. The Tribe argues that the United States also must take
affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe—
including by assessing the Tribe’s water needs, developing a
plan to secure the needed water, and potentially building
pipelines, pumps, wells, or other water infrastructure. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 102 (counsel for Navajo Nation: “I can’t say
that” the United States’s obligation “to ensure
access” to water “would never require any
infrastructure whatsoever”).

															The U. S. District Court for the District
of Arizona dismissed the Navajo Tribe’s complaint. In
relevant part, the District Court determined that the 1868 treaty
did not impose a duty on the United States to take affirmative
steps to secure water for the Tribe.

															The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit reversed, holding in relevant part that the United States
has a duty under the 1868 treaty to take affirmative steps to
secure water for the Navajos. Navajo Nation v. United
States Dept. of Interior, 26 F. 4th 794, 809–814 (2022).
This Court granted certiorari. 598 U. S. ___ (2022).

															II

															When the United States establishes a tribal
reservation, the reservation generally includes (among other
things) the land, the minerals below the land’s surface, the
timber on the land, and the right to use needed water on the
reservation, referred to as reserved water rights. See United
States v. Shoshone Tribe, 304 U.S.
111, 116–118 (1938); Winters v. United
States, 207 U.S.
564, 576–577 (1908); see also Cappaert v.
United States, 426
U.S. 128, 138–139 (1976). Each of those rights is a stick
in the bundle of property rights that makes up a reservation.

															This suit involves water. To help meet their
water needs, the Navajos obtain water from, among other sources,
rivers, tributaries, springs, lakes, and aquifers on the
reservation. As relevant here, the Navajos do not contend that the
United States has interfered with their access to water. Rather,
the Navajos argue that the United States must take affirmative
steps to secure water for the Tribe—for example, by assessing
the Tribe’s water needs, developing a plan to secure the
needed water, and potentially building pipelines, pumps, wells, or
other water infrastructure.

															The Tribe asserts a breach-of-trust claim. To
maintain such a claim here, the Tribe must establish, among other
things, that the text of a treaty, statute, or regulation imposed
certain duties on the United States. See United States v.
Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S.
162, 173–174, 177–178 (2011); United States
v. Navajo Nation, 537 U.S.
488, 506–507 (2003); United States v.
Mitchell, 445 U.S.
535, 542, 546 (1980). The Federal Government owes judicially
enforceable duties to a tribe “only to the extent it
expressly accepts those responsibilities.” Jicarilla,
564 U. S., at 177. Whether the Government has expressly
accepted such obligations “must train on specific
rights-creating or duty-imposing” language in a treaty,
statute, or regulation. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S., at
506. That requirement follows from separation of powers principles.
As this Court recognized in Jicarilla, Congress and the
President exercise the “sovereign function” of
organizing and managing “the Indian trust
relationship.” 564 U. S., at 175. So the federal courts
in turn must adhere to the text of the relevant law—here, the
treaty.[1]

															In the Tribe’s view, the 1868 treaty
imposed a duty on the United States to take affirmative steps to
secure water for the Navajos. With respect, the Tribe is incorrect.
The 1868 treaty “set apart” a reservation for the
“use and occupation of the Navajo tribe.” 15 Stat. 668.
But it contained no “rights-creating or duty-imposing”
language that imposed a duty on the United States to take
affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe. Navajo
Nation, 537 U. S., at 506.

															Notably, the 1868 treaty did impose a number of
specific duties on the United States. Cf. Jicarilla, 564
U. S., at 184–185. For example, the treaty required the
United States to construct a number of buildings on the
reservation, including schools, a chapel, a carpenter shop, and a
blacksmith shop. 15 Stat. 668–669. The treaty also mandated
that the United States provide teachers for the Navajos’
schools for at least 10 years, and to provide articles of clothing
or other goods to the Navajos. Id., at 669. And the treaty
required the United States to supply seeds and agricultural
implements for up to three years. Ibid.

															But the treaty said nothing about any
affirmative duty for the United States to secure water. And as this
Court has stated, “Indian treaties cannot be rewritten or
expanded beyond their clear terms.” Choctaw Nation v.
United States, 318 U.S.
423, 432 (1943); cf. Jicarilla, 564 U. S., at
173–174, 177–178; Navajo Nation, 537 U. S.,
at 506–507; Mitchell, 445 U. S., at 542, 546. So
it is here.

															Moreover, it would be anomalous to conclude that
the United States must take affirmative steps to secure water given
that the United States has no similar duty with respect to the land
on the reservation. For example, under the treaty, the United
States has no duty to farm the land, mine the minerals, or harvest
the timber on the reservation—or, for that matter, to build
roads and bridges on the reservation. Cf. id., at
542–543. Just as there is no such duty with respect to the
land, there likewise is no such duty with respect to the water.

															To be sure, this Court’s precedents have
stated that the United States maintains a general trust
relationship with Indian tribes, including the Navajos.
Jicarilla, 564 U. S., at 176. But as the Solicitor
General explains, the United States is a sovereign, not a private
trustee, meaning that “Congress may style its relations with
the Indians a trust without assuming all the fiduciary duties of a
private trustee, creating a trust relationship that is limited or
bare compared to a trust relationship between private parties at
common law.” Id., at 174 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Therefore, unless Congress has created a conventional
trust relationship with a tribe as to a particular trust asset,
this Court will not “apply common-law trust principles”
to infer duties not found in the text of a treaty, statute, or
regulation. Id., at 178. Here, nothing in the 1868 treaty
establishes a conventional trust relationship with respect to
water.

															In short, the 1868 treaty did not impose a duty
on the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for
the Tribe—including the steps requested by the Navajos here,
such as determining the water needs of the Tribe, providing an
accounting, or developing a plan to secure the needed water.

															Of course, it is not surprising that a treaty
ratified in 1868 did not envision and provide for all of the
Navajos’ current water needs 155 years later, in 2023. Under
the Constitution’s separation of powers, Congress and the
President may update the law to meet modern policy priorities and
needs. To that end, Congress may enact—and often has
enacted—legislation to address the modern water needs of
Americans, including the Navajos, in the West. Indeed, Congress has
authorized billions of dollars for water infrastructure for the
Navajos. See, e.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, 11; Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. 116–260, 134 Stat.
3230.[2]

															But it is not the Judiciary’s role to
update the law. And on this issue, it is particularly important
that federal courts not do so. Allocating water in the arid regions
of the American West is often a zero-sum situation. See Brief for
Western Water Users and Trade Associations as Amici Curiae
13–14, 18–21. And the zero-sum reality of water in the
West underscores that courts must stay in their proper
constitutional lane and interpret the law (here, the treaty)
according to its text and history, leaving to Congress and the
President the responsibility to enact appropriations laws and to
otherwise update federal law as they see fit in light of the
competing contemporary needs for water.

															III

															The Navajo Tribe advances several other
arguments in support of its claim that the 1868 treaty requires the
United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the
Navajos. None is persuasive.

															First, the Navajos note that the text of
the 1868 treaty established the Navajo Reservation as a
“permanent home.” 15 Stat. 671. In the Tribe’s
view, that language means that the United States agreed to take
affirmative steps to secure water. But that assertion finds no
support in the treaty’s text or history, or in any of this
Court’s precedents. The 1868 treaty granted a reservation to
the Navajos and imposed a variety of specific obligations on the
United States—for example, building schools and a chapel,
providing teachers, and supplying seeds and agricultural
implements. The reservation contains a number of water sources that
the Navajos have used and continue to rely on. But as explained
above, the 1868 treaty imposed no duty on the United States to take
affirmative steps to secure water for the Tribe. The 1868 treaty,
as demonstrated by its text and history, helped to ensure that the
Navajos could return to their original land. See Treaty Between the
United States of America and the Navajo Tribe of Indians With a
Record of the Discussions That Led to Its Signing 2, 4,
10–11, 15 (1968).

															Second, the Navajos rely on the provision
of the 1868 treaty in which the United States agreed to provide the
Tribe with certain “seeds and agricultural implements”
for up to three years. 15 Stat. 669. In the Navajos’ view,
those seeds and implements would be unusable without water. But the
reservation contains a number of water sources that the Navajos
have used and continue to rely on. And the United States’s
duty to temporarily provide seeds and agricultural implements for
three years did not include an additional duty to take affirmative
steps to secure water, and to do so indefinitely into the future.
If anything, the treaty’s express requirement that the United
States supply seeds and agricultural implements for a 3-year
period—like the treaty’s requirement that the United
States build schools, a chapel, and the like—demonstrates
that the United States and the Navajos knew how to impose specific
affirmative duties on the United States when they wanted to do
so.

															Third, the Navajos refer to the lengthy
Colorado River water rights litigation that unfolded in a series of
cases decided by this Court from the 1960s to the early 2000s, and
they note that the United States once opposed the intervention of
the Navajos in that litigation. See Response of United States to
Motion of Navajo Tribe To Intervene in Arizona v.
California, O. T. 1961, No. 8, Orig. The Navajos point to
the United States’s opposition as evidence that the United
States has control over the reserved water rights. According to the
Navajos, the United States’s purported control supports their
view that the United States owes trust duties to the Navajos. But
the “Federal Government’s liability” on a
breach-of-trust claim “cannot be premised on control
alone.” United States v. Navajo Nation,
556 U.S.
287, 301 (2009). Again, the Federal Government must
“expressly accep[t]” trust responsibilities in a
treaty, statute, or regulation that contains “rights-creating
or duty-imposing” language. United States v.
Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S.
162, 177 (2011); United States v. Navajo Nation,
537 U.S.
488, 506 (2003). The Navajos have not identified anything of
the sort. In addition, the Navajos may be able to assert the
interests they claim in water rights litigation, including by
seeking to intervene in cases that affect their claimed interests,
and courts will then assess the Navajos’ claims and motions
as appropriate. See 28 U. S. C. §1362;
Arizona v. California, 460 U.S.
605, 615 (1983); see also Blatchford v. Native
Village of Noatak, 501 U.S.
775, 784 (1991); Moe v. Confederated Salish and
Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U.S.
463, 472–474 (1976).[3]

															Fourth, the Tribe argues that, in 1868,
the Navajos would have understood the treaty to mean that the
United States must take affirmative steps to secure water for the
Tribe. But the text of the treaty says nothing to that effect. And
the historical record does not suggest that the United States
agreed to undertake affirmative efforts to secure water for the
Navajos—any more than the United States agreed to farm land,
mine minerals, harvest timber, build roads, or construct bridges on
the reservation. The record of the treaty negotiations makes no
mention of any water-related obligations of the United States at
all. See Treaty Between the United States of America and the Navajo
Tribe of Indians With a Record of the Discussions That Led to Its
Signing.[4]

															*  *  *

															The 1868 treaty reserved necessary water to
accomplish the purpose of the Navajo Reservation. See
Winters v. United States, 207
U.S. 564, 576–577 (1908). But the treaty did not require
the United States to take affirmative steps to secure water for the
Tribe. We reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 The Navajos have
suggested that the Jicarilla line of cases mightapply only
in the context of claims seeking damages from the United States
pursuant to the Tucker Act and Indian Tucker Act. See 28
U. S. C. §§1491, 1505; see also Brief for
Navajo Nation 29. But Jicarilla’s framework for
determining the trust obligations of the United States applies to
any claim seeking to impose trust duties on the United States,
including claims seeking equitable relief. That is because
Jicarilla’s reasoning rests upon separation of powers
principles—not on the particulars of the Tucker Acts. As
Jicarilla explains, the United States is a sovereign, not a
private trustee, and therefore the trust obligations of the United
States to the Indian tribes are established and governed by treaty,
statute, or regulation, rather than by the common law of trusts.
See 564 U. S., at 165, 177. Stated otherwise, the trust
obligations of the United States to the Indian tribes are
established by Congress and the Executive, not created by the
Judiciary.
2
 In this Court, the
Navajos also briefly point to the 1849 treaty. But that treaty did
not grant the Navajos a reservation. In that treaty, the United
States agreed to “designate, settle, and adjust” the
boundaries of the Navajo territory at some future point. 9 Stat.
975. No provision of the 1849 treaty obligated the United States to
take affirmative steps to secure water for the
Navajos.
3
 Similarly, the Navajos
argue that the United States’s control over the Colorado
River “drives home the duty to secure water.” Brief for
Navajo Nation 33, 40. But as already explained, the Tribe has
failed to identify any such duty in the 1868 treaty.
4
 The intervenor States
separately argue that the Navajo Tribe’s claimed remedies
with respect to the Lower Colorado River wouldinterfere with this
Court’s decree in Arizona v. California, 547
U.S. 150 (2006). The question of whether certain remedies would
violate thesubstance of this Court’s 2006 decree is a merits
question, not a question of subject-matter jurisdiction. Because we
conclude that the treatyimposes no duty on the United States to
take affirmative steps to secure water in the first place, we need
not reach the question of whetherparticular remedies would conflict
with this Court’s 2006 decree.
