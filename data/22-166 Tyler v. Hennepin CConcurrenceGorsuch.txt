															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–166

															_________________

															GERALDINE TYLER, PETITIONER v. HENNEPIN
COUNTY, MINNESOTA, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[May 25, 2023]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Jackson
joins, concurring.

															The Court reverses the Eighth Circuit’s
dismissal of Geraldine Tyler’s suit and holds that she has
plausibly alleged a violation of the Fifth Amendment’s
Takings Clause. I agree. Given its Takings Clause holding, the
Court understandably declines to pass on the question whether the
Eighth Circuit committed a further error when it dismissed Ms.
Tyler’s claim under the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive
Fines Clause. Ante, at 14. But even a cursory review of the
District Court’s excessive-fines analysis—which the
Eighth Circuit adopted as “well-reasoned,” 26 F. 4th
789, 794 (2022)—reveals that it too contains mistakes future
lower courts should not be quick to emulate.

															First, the District Court concluded that
the Minnesota tax-forfeiture scheme is not punitive because
“its primary purpose” is
“remedial”—aimed, in other words, at
“compensat[ing] the government for lost revenues due to the
non-payment of taxes.” 505 F. Supp. 3d 879, 896 (Minn.
2020). That primary-purpose test finds no support in our law.
Because “sanctions frequently serve more than one
purpose,” this Court has said that the Excessive Fines Clause
applies to any statutory scheme that “serv[es] in
part to punish.” Austin v. United States,
509 U.S.
602, 610 (1993) (emphasis added). It matters not whether the
scheme has a remedial purpose, even a predominantly remedial
purpose. So long as the law “cannot fairly be said
solely to serve a remedial purpose,” the Excessive
Fines Clause applies. Ibid. (emphasis added; internal
quotation marks omitted). Nor, this Court has held, is it
appropriate to label sanctions as “remedial” when (as
here) they bear “ ‘no correlation to any damages
sustained by society or to the cost of enforcing the
law,’ ” and “any relationship between the
Government’s actual costs and the amount of the sanction is
merely coincidental.” Id., at 621–622, and
n. 14.

															Second, the District Court asserted that
the Minnesota tax-forfeiture scheme cannot “be punitive
because it actually confers a windfall on the delinquent taxpayer
when the value of the property that is forfeited is less than the
amount of taxes owed.” 505 F. Supp. 3d, at 896. That
observation may be factually true, but it is legally irrelevant.
Some prisoners better themselves behind bars; some addicts credit
court-ordered rehabilitation with saving their lives. But
punishment remains punishment all the same. See Tr. of Oral Arg.
61. Of course, no one thinks that an individual who profits from an
economic penalty has a winning excessive-fines claim. But
nor has this Court ever held that a scheme producing fines that
punishes some individuals can escape constitutional scrutiny merely
because it does not punish others.

															Third, the District Court appears to have
inferred that the Minnesota scheme is not “punitive”
because it does not turn on the “culpability” of the
individual property owner. 505 F. Supp. 3d, at 897. But while
a focus on “culpability” can sometimes make a provision
“look more like punishment,” this Court has never
endorsed the converse view. Austin, 509 U. S., at 619.
Even without emphasizing culpability, this Court has said a
statutory scheme may still be punitive where it serves another
“goal of punishment,” such as
“[d]eterrence.” United States v.
Bajakajian, 524 U.S.
321, 329 (1998). And the District Court expressly approved the
Minnesota tax-forfeiture scheme in this case in large part because
“ ‘the ultimate possibility of loss of property
serves as a deterrent to those taxpayers considering tax
delinquency.’ ” 505 F. Supp. 3d, at 899
(emphasis added). Economic penalties imposed to deter willful
noncompliance with the law are fines by any other name. And the
Constitution has something to say about them: They cannot be
excessive.
