															BILL SCHUETTE, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MICHI-GAN,
PETITIONER v. COALITION TO DEFEND AF-FIRMATIVE ACTION, INTEGRATION
AND IMMI-GRANT RIGHTS AND FIGHT FOR EQUALITYBY ANY MEANS NECESSARY
(BAMN), et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[April 22, 2014]

															     Chief Justice
Roberts, concurring.

															     The dissent devotes 11
pages to expounding its own policy preferences in favor of taking
race into account in college admissions, while nonetheless
concluding that it “do[es] not mean to suggest that the
virtues of adopting race-sensitive admissions policies should
inform the legal question before the Court.” Post, at 57
(opinion of Sotomayor, J.). The dissent concedes that the governing
boards of the State’s various universities could have
implemented a policy making it illegal to “discriminate
against, or grant preferential treatment to,” any individ-ual
on the basis of race. See post, at 3, 34–35. On the
dissent’s view, if the governing boards conclude that drawing
racial distinctions in university admissions is undesirable or
counterproductive, they are permissibly exercising their
policymaking authority. But others who might reach the same
conclusion are failing to take race seriously.

															     The dissent states that
“[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to
speak openly and candidly on the subject of race.” Post, at
46. And it urges that “[r]ace matters because of the slights,
the snickers, the silent judgments that reinforce that most
crippling of thoughts: ‘I do not belong
here.’ ” Ibid. But it is not “out of touch
with reality” to conclude that racial preferences may
themselves have the debilitating effect of reinforcing precisely
that doubt, and—if so—that the preferences do more harm
than good. Post, at 45. To disagree with the dissent’s views
on the costs and benefits of racial preferences is not to
“wish away, rather than confront” racial inequality.
Post, at 46. People can disagree in good faith on this issue, but
it similarly does more harm than good to question the openness and
candor of those on either side of the debate.[1]*

Notes

*  and question the
relationship between v. , , and v. , . See at 6, n. 2 (, concurring
in judgment); at 23, n. 9 (, dissenting). The plurality today
addresses that issue, explaining that the race-conscious action in
was unconstitutional given the absence of a showing of prior
segregation. , , at 720–721 (majority opinion), 736
(plurality opinion); see at 9. Today’s plurality notes that
the Court in “assumed” the constitutionality of the
busing remedy at issue there, “ ‘even absent a
finding of prior segregation.’ ” at 10 (quoting ,
, at 472, n. 15). The assumption on which proceeded did not
constitute a finding sufficient to justify the race-conscious
action in , though it is doubtless pertinent in analyzing .
“As this Court held in , the [Seattle] school board’s
purported remedial action would not be permissible today absent a
of segregation,” but “we must understand as understood
itself.” at 9–10 (emphasis added).
