SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-855

															CITY OF SHERRILL, NEW YORK, PETITIONER v.
ONEIDA INDIAN NATION OF NEW YORK et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the second circuit

															[March 29, 2005]

															   Justice Souter, concurring.

															   I join the opinion of the Court
with one qualification that goes to the appropriateness of
considering the long dormancy of any claim to tribal authority over
the parcels in question, as a basis to hold that the Oneida Indian
Nation is not now immune from the taxing authority of local
government. The Tribe’s claim, whether affirmative or
defensive, see ante, at 14, n. 7, is one of
territorial sovereign status entitled to recognition by the
territorial state sovereign and its subdivisions. The claim of
present sovereign status turns not only on background law and the
provisions of treaties, but also on the Tribe’s behavior over
a long period of time: the absence of the Tribe and tribal members
from the particular lots of land, and the Tribe’s failure to
assert sovereignty over them. The Tribe’s inaction cannot,
therefore, be ignored here as affecting only a remedy to be
considered later; it is, rather, central to the very claims of
right made by the contending parties. Since the subject of inaction
was not expressly raised as a separate question presented for
review, see ante, at 14, n. 8, there is some question
whether we should order reargument before dealing with it. I think
that is unnecessary; the issue was addressed by each side in the
argument prior to submission of the case, notwithstanding the terms
of the questions on which review was granted.
