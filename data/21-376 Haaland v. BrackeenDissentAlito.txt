court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 15, 2023]

															

															Justice Alito, dissenting.

															The first line in the Court’s opinion
identifies what is most important about these cases: they are
“about children who are among the most vulnerable.”
Ante, at 1. But after that opening nod, the Court loses
sight of this overriding concern and decides one question after
another in a way that disserves the rights and interests of these
children and their parents, as well as our Constitution’s
division of federal and state authority.

															Decisions about child custody, foster care, and
adoption are core state functions. The paramount concern in these
cases has long been the “best interests” of the
children involved. See, e.g., 3 T. Zeller, Family Law and
Practice §§32.06, 32.08 (2022); 6 id.,
§64.06. But in many cases, provisions of the Indian Child
Welfare Act (ICWA) compel actions that conflict with this
fundamental state policy, subordinating what family-court
judges—and often biological parents—determine to be in
the best interest of a child to what Congress believed is in the
best interest of a tribe.

															The cases involved in this litigation illustrate
the distressing consequences. To its credit, the Court acknowledges
what happened to these children, but its decision does nothing to
prevent the repetition of similar events. Take A. L. M.
His adoption by a loving non-Indian couple, with whom he had lived
for over a year and had developed a strong emotional bond, was
initially blocked even though it was supported by both of his
biological parents, his grandmother, and the testimony of both his
court-appointed guardian and a psychological expert. Because a
Tribe objected, he would have been sent to an Indian couple that he
did not know in another State had the non-Indian couple not sought
and obtained an emergency judicial order.

															Baby O.’s story is similar. A non-Indian
couple welcomed Baby O. into their home when she was three days old
and cared for her for more than two years while seeking to adopt
her. The couple ensured that Baby O.’s serious medical needs
were met and maintained regular visits with Baby O.’s
biological mother so that Baby O. could have a continuing
relationship with her biological family. Even though both
biological parents supported the couple’s adoption of Baby
O., a Tribe objected and sought to send Baby O. to live in foster
care on a reservation in another State. Only after the couple
joined this lawsuit did the Tribe agree to a settlement that would
permit the couple to finalize the adoption.

															After nearly two years moving between
foster-care placements, Child P., whose maternal grandmother is a
member of an Indian Tribe, was placed with a non-Indian couple who
provided her a stable home. After the placement, the Tribe, which
had told the state court years earlier that Child P. was not
eligible for tribal membership, reversed its position without
explanation and enrolled her as a member. The Tribe then objected
to the couple’s efforts to adopt Child P., even though her
court-appointed guardian believed that the adoption was in Child
P.’s best interest. “To comply with the ICWA,”
the state court removed Child P. from the couple’s custody
and placed her with her maternal grandmother, “who had lost
her foster license due to a criminal conviction.”
Ante, at 8 (majority opinion).

															Does the Constitution give Congress the
authority to bring about such results? I would hold that it does
not. Whatever authority Congress possesses in the area of Indian
affairs, it does not have the power to sacrifice the best interests
of vulnerable children to promote the interests of tribes in
maintaining membership. Nor does Congress have the power to force
state judges to disserve the best interests of children or the
power to delegate to tribes the authority to force those judges to
abide by the tribes’ priorities regarding adoption and
foster-care placement.

															I

															The Court makes a valiant effort to bring
coherence to what has been said in past cases about
Congress’s power in this area, but its attempt falls short.
At the end of a lengthy discussion, the majority distills only this
nugget: Congress’s power over Indian affairs is
“plenary” but not “absolute.” Ante,
at 13–14. The majority in today’s cases did not coin
this formulation; it merely repeats what earlier cases have said.
See, e.g., Delaware Tribal Business Comm. v.
Weeks, 430 U.S.
73, 84 (1977) (quoting United States v. Alcea Band of
Tillamooks, 329 U.S.
40, 54 (1946) (plurality opinion)). But the formulation’s
pedigree cannot make up for its vacuity. The term
“plenary” is defined in one dictionary after another as
“absolute.” See, e.g., New Oxford American
Dictionary 1343 (3d ed. 2010); Webster’s Third New
International Dictionary 1739 (2002); The Random House Dictionary
of the English Language 1486 (2d ed. 1987). If we accept these
definitions, what the Court says is that absolute ≠ absolute and
plenary ≠ plenary, violating one of the most basic laws of
logic. Surely we can do better than that.

															We need not map the outer bounds of
Congress’s Indian affairs authority to hold that the
challenged provisions of ICWA lie outside it. We need only
acknowledge that even so-called plenary powers cannot override
foundational constitutional constraints. By attempting to control
state judicial proceedings in a field long-recognized to be the
virtually exclusive province of the States, ICWA violates the
fundamental structure of our constitutional order.

															In reaching this conclusion, I do not question
the proposition that Congress has broad power to regulate Indian
affairs. We have “consistently described”
Congress’s “powers to legislate in respect to Indian
tribes” as “ ‘plenary and
exclusive.’ ” United States v. Lara,
541 U.S.
193, 200 (2004) (collecting cases). Reflecting this
understanding, we have sanctioned a wide range of enactments that
bear on Indian tribes and their members, sometimes (regrettably)
without tracing the source of Congress’s authority to a
particular enumerated power. See, e.g., Santa Clara
Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S.
49, 56–58 (1978) (modifying tribal governments’
powers of self-government); Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock,
187 U.S.
553, 565–566 (1903) (transferring tribal land). Nor do I
dispute the notion that Congress has undertaken responsibilities
that have been roughly analogized to those of a trustee. In
exercising its constitutionally-granted powers, the Federal
Government, “following ‘a humane and self imposed
policy,’ ” has committed itself to
“ ‘moral obligations of the highest responsibility
and trust’ ” to the Indian people. United
States v. Jicarilla Apache Nation, 564 U.S.
162, 176 (2011).[1]

															Nevertheless, we have repeatedly cautioned that
Congress’s Indian affairs power is not unbounded. And while
we have articulated few limits, we have acknowledged what should be
one obvious constraint: Congress’s authority to regulate
Indian affairs is limited by other “pertinent constitutional
restrictions” that circumscribe the legislative power.
United States v. Creek Nation, 295 U.S.
103, 109–110 (1935); see also New York v.
United States, 505 U.S.
144, 156 (1992) (“Congress exercises its conferred powers
subject to the limitations contained in the
Constitution”).

															For example, in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.
Florida, 517 U.S.
44 (1996), we held that Congress’s power under the Indian
Commerce Clause was limited by “the background principle of
state sovereign immunity embodied in the Eleventh Amendment.”
Id., at 72. We rejected the Tribe’s argument that
Congress’s Indian affairs power could exceed other
constitutional restrictions when “necessary” to
“ ‘protect the tribes’ ” from
state interference. Id., at 60. Foundational constitutional
principles like state sovereign immunity, we observed, are
“not so ephemeral as to dissipate when the subject of the
suit is [in] an area, like the regulation of Indian commerce, that
is under the exclusive control of the Federal Government.”
Id., at 72. Even when we have sustained legislation, we have
cautioned against congressional overreach. See Lara, 541
U. S., at 203–205. We have suggested that a law may
exceed Congress’s power to regulate Indian affairs if it has
“an unusual legislative objective,” brings about
“radical changes in tribal status,” or
“interfere[s] with the power or authority of any
State.” Ibid.

															We have rarely had occasion to enforce these
limits, in part because the enactments before us have often fallen
comfortably within the historical bounds of Congress’s
enumerated powers. See ante, at 33–38 (Thomas, J.,
dissenting). But that does not mean that we should shy away from
enforcement when presented with a statute that exceeds what the
Constitution allows.

															II

															Congress’s power in the area of Indian
affairs cannot exceed the limits imposed by the “system of
dual sovereignty between the States and the Federal
Government” established by the Constitution. Gregory
v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S.
452, 457 (1991). “The powers delegated . . . to
the federal government are few and defined,” while
“[t]hose which . . . remain in the State
governments are numerous and indefinite.” The Federalist No.
45, p. 292 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The powers retained
by the States constitute “ ‘a residuary and
inviolable sovereignty,’ ” secure against federal
intrusion. Printz v. United States, 521 U.S.
898, 919 (1997) (quoting The Federalist No. 39, at 245 (J.
Madison)). This structural principle, reinforced in the Tenth
Amendment, “confirms that the power of the Federal Government
is subject to limits that may, in a given instance, reserve power
to the States.” New York, 505 U. S., at 157. The
corollary is also true: in some circumstances, the powers reserved
to the States inform the scope of Congress’s power.
Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 584
U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 15). This includes in the
area of Indian affairs. Dick v. United States,
208 U.S.
340, 353 (1908) (Congress’s primacy over Indian tribes
and States’ “full and complete jurisdiction over all
persons and things within [their] limits” are
“fundamental principles . . . of equal dignity, and
neither must be so enforced as to nullify or substantially impair
the other”).

															While we have never comprehensively enumerated
the States’ reserved powers, we have long recognized that
governance of family relations—including marriage
relationships and child custody—is among them. It is not
merely that these matters “have traditionally been governed
by state law” or that the responsibility over them
“remains primarily with the States,” ante, at 14
(majority opinion), but that the field of domestic relations
“has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive
province of the States,” Sosna v. Iowa,
419 U.S.
393, 404 (1975) (emphasis added). “The whole subject of
the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child,
belongs to the laws of the States, and not to the laws of the
United States.” In re Burrus, 136
U.S. 586, 593–594 (1890). “Cases decided by this
Court over a period of more than a century bear witness to this
historical fact.” Sosna, 419 U. S., at 404. See,
e.g., United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S.
744, 766 (2013); McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U.S.
210, 220 (1981); Simms v. Simms, 175 U.S.
162, 167 (1899); Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S.
714, 722, 734–735 (1878).

															This does not mean that federal law may never
touch on family matters. As the majority observes, ante, at
14, we have held that federal legislation that regulates certain
“economic aspects of domestic relations” can preempt
conflicting state law. Ridgway v. Ridgway, 454 U.S.
46, 55–56 (1981) (providing an order of precedence for
beneficiaries of a service member’s life insurance policy);
see, e.g., Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U.S.
483, 485–486 (2013) (allocating federal death benefits);
McCarty, 453 U. S., at 211, 235–236 (allocating
military retirement pay). But we have never held that Congress
under any of its enumerated powers may regulate the very nature of
those relations or dictate their creation, dissolution, or
modification. Nor could we and remain faithful to our founding.
“No one denies that the States, at the time of the adoption
of the Constitution, possessed full power over” ordinary
family relations; and “the Constitution delegated no
authority to the Government of the United States” in this
area. Haddock v. Haddock, 201
U.S. 562, 575 (1906). It is a “most important aspect of
our federalism” that “the domestic relations of husband
and wife”—and parent and child—are “matters
reserved to the States and do not belong to the United
States.” Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U.S.
226, 233 (1945) (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted).

															As part of that reserved power, state courts
have resolved child custody matters arising among state citizens
since the earliest days of the Nation. See, e.g.,
Nickols v. Giles, 2 Root 461, 461–462 (Conn.
Super. Ct. 1796) (declining to remove daughter from mother’s
care); Wright v. Wright, 2 Mass. 109, 110–111
(1806) (awarding custody of child to mother following divorce);
Commonwealth v. Nutt, 1 Browne 143, 145 (Pa. Ct.
Common Pleas 1810) (assigning custody of child to her sister).
Then, as now, state courts’ overriding concern was the best
interests of the children. See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
Addicks, 5 Binn. 520, 521 (Pa. 1813) (court’s
“anxiety is principally directed” to the child’s
welfare); In re Waldron, 13 Johns. Cas. 418, 421
(N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1816) (court is “principally to be
directed” by “the benefit and the welfare” of the
child). By the mid-19th century, States had begun enacting
statutory adoption schemes, enforceable through state courts,
“to provide for the welfare of dependent children,”
starting with Massachusetts in 1851. S. Presser, The Historical
Background of the American Law of Adoption, 11 J. Fam. L. 443, 453,
465 (1971) (Presser); 1851 Mass. Acts ch. 324. Over the next 25
years, 23 other States followed suit. Presser 465–466, and
nn. 111, 112. As the cases before us attest, this historic
tradition of state oversight of child custody and welfare through
state judicial proceedings continues to the present day.

															The ICWA provisions challenged here do not
simply run up against this traditional state authority, they run
roughshod over it when the State seeks to protect one of its young
citizens who also happens to be a member of an Indian tribe or who
is the biological child of a member and eligible for tribal
membership, herself. 25 U. S. C. §1903(4). In those
circumstances, ICWA requires a State to abandon the
carefully-considered judicial procedures and standards it has
established to provide for a child’s welfare and instead
apply a scheme devised by Congress that focuses not solely on the
best interest of the child, but also on “the stability and
security of Indian tribes.” §1902. That scheme requires
States to invite tribal authorities with no existing relationship
to a child to intervene in judicial custody proceedings,
§§1911(c), 1912(a), 1914. It requires States to replace
their reasoned standards for termination of parental rights and
placement in foster care with standards that favor the interests of
an Indian custodian over those of the child. §§1912(e),
(f ). It forces state courts to give Indian couples (even
those of different tribes) priority in adoption and foster-care
placements, even over a non-Indian couple who would better serve a
child’s emotional and other needs.
§§1915(a), (b). And it requires state judges to
subordinate the State’s typical custodial considerations to a
tribe’s alternative preference. §1915(c).

															It is worth underscoring that ICWA’s
directives apply even when the child is not a member of a tribe and
has never been involved in tribal life, and even when a
child’s biological parents object. As seen in the cases
before us, the sad consequence is that ICWA’s provisions may
delay or prevent a child’s adoption by a family ready to
provide her a permanent home.

															ICWA’s mandates do not simply touch on
family matters. They override States’ authority to
determine—and implement through their courts—the child
custody and welfare policies they deem most appropriate for their
citizens. And in doing so, the mandates harm vulnerable children
and their parents. In my view, the Constitution cannot countenance
this result. The guarantee of dual sovereignty embodied in the
constitutional structure “is not so ephemeral as to
dissipate” simply because Congress invoked a so-called
plenary power. Seminole Tribe of Fla., 517 U. S., at
72. The challenged ICWA provisions effectively
“nullify” a State’s authority to conduct state
child custody proceedings in accordance with its own preferred
family relations policies, a prerogative that States have exercised
for centuries. Dick, 208 U. S., at 353.
Congress’s Indian affairs power, broad as it is, does not
extend that far.[2]

															The indicators we previously identified also
signal that ICWA exceeds Congress’s constitutional bounds.
See Lara, 541 U. S., at 203–205. First, the law
has “an unusual legislative objective.” Id., at
203. ICWA’s attempt to control local judicial proceedings in
a core field of state concern departs significantly from other
Indian affairs legislation that we have sanctioned—laws that
typically regulated actual commerce, related to tribal lands and
governance, or fulfilled treaty obligations. See ante, at
33–38 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Second, the law brings about
“radical changes in tribal status,” effectively
granting tribes veto power over state judgments regarding the
welfare of resident Indian children. Lara, 541 U. S.,
at 205. And third, the law “interfere[s] with the power [and]
authority of [every] State” in the conduct of state judicial
proceedings and determination of child custody arrangements.
Ibid. That is, in fact, its express design. See,
e.g., §§1911(c), 1912, 1915. These indicators
confirm that ICWA surpasses even a generous understanding of
Congress’s Indian affairs authority.

															*  *  *

															I am sympathetic to the challenges that tribes
face in maintaining membership and preserving their cultures. And I
do not question the idea that the best interests of children may in
some circumstances take into account a desire to enable children to
maintain a connection with the culture of their ancestors. The
Constitution provides Congress with many means for promoting such
interests. But the Constitution does not permit Congress to
displace long-exercised state authority over child custody
proceedings to advance those interests at the expense of vulnerable
children and their families.

															Because I would hold that Congress lacked
authority to enact the challenged ICWA provisions, I respectfully
dissent.

Notes
1
The state of affairs on many
Indian reservations, however, does not speak well of the way in
which these duties have been discharged by this putative trustee.
See, e.g., U. S. Commission on Civil Rights, Broken
Promises: Continuing Federal Funding Shortfall for Native Americans
102–107, 135–138, 156–157, 165–166 (Dec.
2018) (discussing poor performance of students in tribal schools,
substandard housing and physical infrastructure on reservations,
and high rates of unemployment among Indians living on
reservations).
2
 Because ICWA’s
provisions comprise a comprehensive child custody scheme relevant
only to state court proceedings, I generally do not believe they
can be severed without engaging in “quintessentially
legislative work.” Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of
Northern New Eng., 546 U.S.
320, 329 (2006). An exception is §1911(a), which gives
Indian tribes exclusive jurisdiction over child custody proceedings
involving Indian children living within a reservation; that section
is not implicated by my analysis. See also Fisher v.
District Court of Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont.,
424 U.S.
382, 383, 388–389 (1976) (per curiam) (recognizing
exclusive tribal court jurisdiction over adoption proceedings,
where all parties are members of a tribe living on a
reservation).
