															[December 10, 2003]

															   Justice Breyer delivered the
opinion of the Court with respect to BCRA Title V.*

															   We consider here the
constitutionality of §504 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform
Act of 2002 (BCRA), amending the Communications Act of 1934. That
section requires broadcasters to keep publicly available records of
politically related broadcasting requests. 47 U. S. C. A.
§315(e) (Supp. 2003). The McConnell plaintiffs, who include
the National Association of Broadcasters, argue that §504
imposes onerous administrative burdens, lacks any offsetting
justification, and consequently violates the First Amendment. For
similar reasons, the three judges on the District Court found BCRA
§504 unconstitutional on its face. 251 F. Supp. 2d 176,
186 (DC 2003) (per curiam) (case below). We disagree, and
we reverse that determination.

															I

															   BCRA §504’s key
requirements are the following:

															   (1) A “candidate
request” requirement calls for broadcasters to keep records
of broadcast requests “made by or on behalf of” any
“legally qualified candidate for public office.” 47 U.
S. C. A. §315(e)(1)(A) (Supp. 2003).

															   (2) An “election message request”
requirement calls for broadcasters to keep records of requests
(made by anyone) to broadcast “message[s]” that refer
either to a “legally qualified candidate” or to
“any election to Federal office.”
§§315(e)(1)(B)(i), (ii).

															   (3) An “issue request” requirement
calls for broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by anyone)
to broadcast “message[s]” related to a “national
legislative issue of public importance,”
§315(e)(1)(B)(iii), or otherwise relating to a
“political matter of national importance,”
§315(e)(1)(B).

															   We shall consider each provision in turn.

															II

															   BCRA §504’s
“candidate request” requirements are virtually
identical to those contained in a regulation that the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) promulgated as early as 1938 and
which with slight modifications the FCC has maintained in effect
ever since. 47 CFR §73.1943 (2002); compare 3 Fed. Reg. 1692
(1938) (47 CFR §36a4); 13 Fed. Reg. 7486 (1948) (47 CFR
§§3.190(d), 3.290(d), 3.690(d)); 17 Fed. Reg. 4711 (1952)
(47 CFR §3.590(d)); 19 Fed. Reg. 5949 (1954); 23 Fed. Reg.
7817 (1958); 28 Fed. Reg. 13593 (1963) (47 CFR §73.120(d)); 43
Fed. Reg. 32795 (1978) (47 CFR §73.1940(d)); 57 Fed. Reg. 210
(1992) (47 CFR §73.1943). See generally Brief in Opposition to
Motion of Appellee National Association of Broadcasters for Summary
Affirmance in No. 02–1676, pp. 9–10 (hereinafter
Brief Opposing Summary Affirmance).

															   In its current form the FCC
regulation requires broadcast licensees to “keep” a
publicly available file “of all requests for broadcast time
made by or on behalf of a candidate for public office,” along
with a notation showing whether the request was granted, and (if
granted) a history that includes “classes of time,”
“rates charged,” and when the “spots actually
aired.” 47 CFR §73.1943(a) (2002); §76.1701(a)
(same for cable systems). These regulation-imposed requirements
mirror the statutory requirements imposed by BCRA §504 with
minor differences which no one here challenges. Compare 47 CFR
§73.1943 with 47 U. S. C. A. §315(e)(2) (see
Appendix, infra).

															   The McConnell plaintiffs argue that these
requirements are “intolerabl[y]” “burdensome and
invasive.” Brief for Appellants/Cross-Appellees Senator Mitch
McConnell et al. in No. 02–1674 et al., p. 74
(hereinafter Brief for McConnell Plaintiffs). But we do not see how
that could be so. The FCC has consistently estimated that its
“candidate request” regulation imposes upon each
licensee an additional administrative burden of six to seven hours
of work per year. See 66 Fed. Reg. 37468 (2001); id., at
18090; 63 Fed. Reg. 26593 (1998); id., at 10379; 57 Fed.
Reg. 18492 (1992); see also 66 Fed. Reg. 29963 (2001) (total annual
burden of one hour per cable system). That burden means annual
costs of a few hundred dollars at most, a microscopic amount
compared to the many millions of dollars of revenue broadcasters
receive from candidates who wish to advertise.

															   Perhaps for this reason, broadcasters in the
past did not strongly oppose the regulation or its extension. Cf.,
e.g., 17 Fed. Reg. 4711 (1952) (“No comments adverse
to the adoption of the proposed rule have been received”); 43
Fed. Reg. 32794 (1978) (no adverse comments). Indeed in 1992,
“CBS” itself “suggest[ed]” that the
candidate file “include a record of all requests for
time.” 57 Fed. Reg. 206 (1992); cf. 63 Fed. Reg. 49493 (1998)
(FCC “not persuaded that the current retention period [two
years] is overly burdensome to licensees”).

															   In any event, as the FCC wrote in an analogous
context, broadcaster recordkeeping requirements
“ ‘simply run with the
territory.’ ” 40 Fed. Reg. 18398 (1975).
Broadcasters must keep and make publicly available numerous
records. See 47 CFR §73.3526 (2002) (general description of
select recordkeeping requirements for commercial stations); see
also §§73.1202, 73.3526(e)(9)(i) (retention of all
“written comments and suggestions [including letters and
e-mail] received from the public regarding operation of the
station” for three years); §73.1212(e) (sponsorship
identification records, including the identification of a
sponsoring entity’s executive officers and board-level
members when sponsoring “political matter or matter involving
the discussion of a controversial issue of public
importance”); §73.1840 (retention of station logs);
§73.1942 (candidate broadcast records); §73.2080 (equal
employment oppor- tunities records); §§73.3526(e)(11)(i),
(e)(12) (“list of programs that have provided the
station’s most significant treatment of community issues
during the preceding three month period,” including
“brief narrative describing [the issues, and] time, date,
duration, and title”); §§73.3526(e)(11)(ii), (iii)
(reports of children’s program, and retention of records
sufficient to substantiate “compliance with the commercial
limits on children’s programming”); §73.3613(a)
(network affiliation contracts); §§73.3613(b), 73.3615,
73.3526(e)(5) (ownership-related reports); §73.3613(c)
(“[m]anagement consultant agreements”);
§73.3613(d) (“[t]ime brokerage agreements”).
Compared to these longstanding recordkeeping requirements, an
additional six to seven hours is a small drop in a very large
bucket.

															   The McConnell plaintiffs also
claim that the “candidate requests” requirement fails
significantly to further any important governmental interest. Brief
for McConnell Plaintiffs 74. But, again, we cannot agree. The FCC
has pointed out that “[t]hese records are necessary to permit
political candidates and others to verify that licensees have
complied with their obligations relating to use of their facilities
by candidates for political office” pursuant to the
“equal time” provision of 47 U. S. C.
§315(a). 63 Fed. Reg. 49493 (1998). They also help the FCC
determine whether broadcasters have violated their obligation to
sell candidates time at the “lowest unit charge.” 47 U.
S. C. §315(b). As reinforced by BCRA, the
“candidate request” requirements will help the FCC, the
Federal Election Commission, and “the public to evaluate
whether broadcasters are processing [candidate] requests in an
evenhanded fashion,” Brief Opposing Summary Affirmance 9,
thereby helping to assure broadcasting fairness. 47 U. S. C.
§315(a); Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.
FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 390
(1969). They will help make the public aware of how much money
candidates may be prepared to spend on broadcast messages. 2 U.
S. C. A. §434 (main ed. and Supp. 2003); see
ante, at 87–93 (joint opinion of Stevens and
O’Connor, JJ.) (hereinafter joint opinion). And they will
provide an independently compiled set of data for purposes of
verifying candidates’ compliance with the disclosure
requirements and source limitations of BCRA and the Federal
Election Campaign Act of 1971. 2 U. S. C. A. §434;
cf. Adventure Communications, Inc. v. Kentucky
Registry of Election Finance, 191 F. 3d 429, 433 (CA4
1999) (candidate compliance verification); 63 Fed. Reg. 49493
(1998) (FCC finding record retention provision provides public with
“necessary and adequate access”).   

															   We note, too, that the
FCC’s regulatory authority is broad. Red Lion,
supra, at 380 (“broad” mandate to assure
broadcasters operate in public interest); National Broadcasting
Co. v. United States, 319 U. S. 190, 219
(1943) (same). And we have previously found broad governmental
authority for agency information demands from regulated entities.
Compare United States v. Morton Salt
Co., 338
U. S. 632, 642–643 (1950); Oklahoma Press Publishing
Co. v. Walling, 327 U. S. 186, 209
(1946); Donovan v. Lone Steer,
Inc., 464
U. S. 408, 414–415 (1984).    

															   The Chief Justice suggests that the Government
has not made these particular claims. But it has—though
succinctly—for it has cross-referenced the relevant
regulatory rules. Compare post, at 12–13 (opinion of
Rehnquist, C. J.), with Brief Opposing Summary Affirmance; Brief
for McConnell Plaintiffs 73–74; Brief for FEC et al. in
No. 02–1674 et al., pp. 132–133. And succinctness
through cross-reference was necessary given our procedural
requirement that the Government set forth in a 140-page brief
all its arguments concerning each of the 20 BCRA
provisions here under contest. 251 F. Supp. 2d, at
186–188.

															   In sum, given the Government’s reference
to the 65-year-old FCC regulation and the related considerations we
have mentioned, we cannot accept the argument that the
constitutionality of the “candidate request” provision
lacks evidentiary support. The challengers have made no attempt to
explain away the FCC’s own contrary conclusions and the mass
of evidence in related FCC records and proceedings. E.g.,
57 Fed. Reg. 189 (1992); cf. supra, at 4–5;
ante, at 117–118 (joint opinion) (upholding
BCRA’s coordination provision based, in part, on prior
experience under similar provision). Because we cannot, on the
present record, find the longstanding FCC regulation
unconstitutional, we likewise cannot strike down the
“candidate request” provision in BCRA §504; for
the latter simply embodies the regulation in a statute, thereby
blocking any agency attempt to repeal it.

															III

															   BCRA §504’s
“election message request” requirements call for
broadcasters to keep records of requests (made by any member of the
public) to broadcast a “message” about “a legally
qualified candidate” or “any election to Federal
office.” 47 U. S. C. A.
§§315(e)(1)(B)(i), (ii) (Supp. 2003). Although these
requirements are somewhat broader than the “candidate
request” requirement, they serve much the same purposes. A
candidate’s supporters or opponents account for many of the
requests to broadcast “message[s]” about a
“candidate.” Requests to broadcast messages about an
“election” may include messages that favor one
candidate or another, along with other messages that may be more
neutral.

															   Given the nature of many of the
messages, recordkeeping can help both the regulatory agencies and
the public evaluate broadcasting fairness, and determine the amount
of money that individuals or groups, supporters or opponents,
intend to spend to help elect a particular candidate. Cf.
ante, at 100–101 (joint opinion) (upholding
stringent restrictions on all election-time advertising
that refers to a candidate because such advertising will
often convey message of support or opposition). Insofar as
the request is to broadcast neutral material about a candidate or
election, the disclosure can help the FCC carry out other statutory
functions, for example, determining whether a broadcasting station
is fulfilling its licensing obligation to broadcast material
important to the community and the public. 47 U. S. C.
§315(a) (“obligation … to afford reasonable
opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of
public importance”); 47 CFR §73.1910 (2002);
§§73.3526(e)(11)(i), (e)(12) (recordkeeping requirements
for issues important to the community).

															   For reasons previously discussed,
supra, at 4–5, and on the basis of the material
presented, we cannot say that these requirements will impose
disproportionate administrative burdens. They ask the broadcaster
to keep information about the disposition of the request, and
information identifying the individual or company requesting the
broadcast time (name, address, contact information, or, if the
requester is not an individual, the names of company officials). 47
U. S. C. A. §315(e)(2) (Supp. 2003). Insofar as the
“request” is made by a candidate’s
“supporters,” the “candidate request”
regulation apparently already requires broadcasters to keep such
records. 43 Fed. Reg. 32794 (1978). Regardless, the information
should prove readily available, for the individual requesting a
broadcast must provide it to the broadcaster should the broadcaster
accept the request. 47 CFR §73.1212(e) (2002). And as we have
previously pointed out, the recordkeeping requirements do not reach
significantly beyond other FCC recordkeeping rules, for example,
those requiring broadcasting licensees to keep material showing
com- pliance with their license-related promises to broad- cast
material on issues of public importance. See, e.g.,
§§73.3526(e)(11)(i), (e)(12) (recordkeeping requirements
for issues important to the community); supra, at
4–5 (collecting regulations); Office of Communication of
United Church of Christ v. FCC, 707 F. 2d 1413,
1421–1422 (CADC 1983) (describing FCC rules, in force during
1960–1981, that required nonentertainment programming in 14
specific areas and mandated publicly available records detailing
date, time, source, and description to substantiate compliance).
If, as we have held, the “candidate request”
requirements are constitutional, supra, at 7, the
“election message” requirements, which serve similar
governmental interests and impose only a small incremental burden,
must be constitutional as well.

															IV

															   The “issue request”
requirements call for broadcasters to keep records of requests
(made by any member of the public) to broadcast
“message[s]” about “a national legislative issue
of public importance” or “any political matter of
national importance.” 47 U. S. C. A.
§§315(e)(1)(B), (e)(1)(B)(iii) (Supp. 2003). These
recordkeeping requirements seem likely to help the FCC determine
whether broadcasters are carrying out their “obligations to
afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting
views on issues of public importance,” 47 CFR §73.1910
(2002), and whether broadcasters are too heavily favoring
entertainment, and discriminating against broadcasts devoted to
public affairs, see ibid.; 47 U. S. C §315(a);
Red Lion, 395 U. S., at 380.

															   The McConnell plaintiffs claim
that the statutory language—“political matter of
national importance” or “national legislative issue of
public importance”—is unconstitutionally vague or
overbroad. Brief for McConnell Plaintiffs 74–75. But that
language is no more general than the language that Congress has
used to impose other obligations upon broadcasters. Compare 47 U.
S. C. A. §315(e)(1)(B) (Supp. 2003)
(“political matter of national importance”) and
§315(e)(1)(B)(iii) (“national legislative issue of
public importance”) (both added by BCRA §504), with 47
U. S. C. §315(a) (“obligation … to operate
in the public interest” and to afford reasonable opportunity
for discussion of “issues of public importance”);
§317(a)(2) (FCC disclosure requirements relating to any
“political program” or “discussion of any
controversial issue”); cf. 47 CFR §73.1212(e) (2002)
(“political matter or … a controversial issue of
public importance”); and 9 Fed. Reg. 14734 (1944)
(“public controversial issues”); ante, at
117–118 (joint opinion) (noting that the experience under
longstanding regulations undermines claims of chilling effect). And
that language is also roughly comparable to other language in BCRA
that we uphold today. E.g., ante, at 61–62,
and n. 64 (joint opinion) (upholding 2 U. S. C. A.
§431(20)(A)(iii) (Supp. 2003) (“public communication
that refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office
… and that promotes or supports a candidate for that office,
or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office”)),
ante, at 117–118 (upholding 2 U. S. C. A.
§441a(a)(7)(B)(ii) (Supp. 2003) (counting as coordinated
disbursements that are made “in cooperation, consultation, or
concert with, or at the request or suggestion of [a political
party]”) against challenge and noting that an
“agreement” is not necessary for precision).

															   Whether these requirements impose
disproportionate administrative burdens is more difficult to say.
On the one hand, the burdens are likely less heavy than many that
other FCC regulations have imposed, for example, the burden of
keeping and disclosing “[a]ll written comments and
suggestions” received from the public, including every
e-mail. 47 CFR §§73.1202, 73.3526(e)(9) (2002); see also
supra, at 4–5. On the other hand, the burdens are
likely heavier than those imposed by BCRA §504’s other
provisions, previously discussed.

															   The regulatory burden, in practice, will
depend on how the FCC interprets and applies this provision. The
FCC has adequate legal authority to write regulations that may
limit, and make more specific, the provision’s potential
linguistic reach. 47 U. S. C. §315(d). It has often
ameliorated regulatory burdens by interpretation in the past, and
there is no reason to believe it will not do so here. See 14 FCC
Rcd. 4653, ¶ ;25 (1999) (relaxing the recordkeeping
requirements in respect to cable systems that serve fewer than
5,000 subscribers); 14 FCC Rcd. 11121, ¶ ;¶ ;20–22
(1999) (requiring candidates to inspect the political file at a
station rather than requiring licensees to send out photocopies of
the files to candidates upon telephone request). The parties remain
free to challenge the provisions, as interpreted by the FCC in
regulations, or as otherwise applied. Any such challenge will
likely provide greater information about the provisions’
justifications and administrative burdens. Without that additional
information, we cannot now say that the burdens are so great, or
the justifications so minimal, as to warrant finding the provisions
unconstitutional on their face.

															   The McConnell plaintiffs and The Chief Justice
make one final claim. They say that the “issue request”
requirement will force them to disclose information that will
reveal their political strategies to opponents, perhaps prior to a
broadcast. See post, at 14–15 (dissenting opinion).
We are willing to assume that the Constitution includes some form
of protection against premature disclosure of campaign
strategy—though, given the First Amendment interest in free
and open discussion of campaign issues, we make this assumption
purely for argument’s sake. Nonetheless, even on that
assumption we do not see how BCRA §504 can be unconstitutional
on its face.

															   For one thing, the statute requires disclosure
of names, addresses, and the fact of a request; it does not require
disclosure of substantive campaign content. See 47 U.
S. C. A. §315(e)(2) (Supp. 2003). For another, the
statutory words “as soon as possible,” §315(e)(3),
would seem to permit FCC disclosure-timing rules that would avoid
any premature disclosure that the Constitution itself would forbid.
Further, the plaintiffs do not point to—and our own research
cannot find—any specific indication of such a
“strategy-disclosure” problem arising during the past
65 years in respect to the existing FCC “candidate
request” requirement, where the strategic problem might be
expected to be more acute. Finally, we today reject an analogous
facial attack—premised on speculations of “advance
disclosure”—on a similar BCRA provision. See
ante, at 94 (joint opinion). Thus, the “strategy
disclosure” argument does not show that BCRA §504 is
unconstitutional on its face, but the plaintiffs remain free to
raise this argument when §504 is applied.

															V

															   The Chief Justice makes two
important arguments in response to those we have set forth. First,
he says that we “approac[h] §504 almost exclusively from
the perspective of the broadcast licensees, ignoring the interests
of candidates and other purchasers, whose speech and association
rights are affected.” Post, at 11 (dissenting
opinion). The Chief Justice is certainly correct in emphasizing the
importance of the speech interests of candidates and other
potential speakers, but we have not ignored their First Amendment
“perspective.”

															   To the contrary, we have
discussed the speakers’ interests together with the
broadcasters’ interests because the two sets of interests
substantially overlap. For example, the speakers’ vagueness
argument is no different from the broadcasters’, and it fails
for the same reasons, e.g., the fact that BCRA
§504’s language is just as definite and precise as other
language that we today uphold. See supra, at 10.

															   We have separately discussed the one and
only speech-related claim advanced on behalf of candidates (or
other speakers) that differs from the claims set forth by the
broadcasters. See supra, at 11–12. This is the claim
that the statute’s disclosure requirements will require
candidates to reveal their political strategies to opponents. We
just said, and we now repeat, that BCRA §504 can be applied,
in a significant number of cases, without requiring any such
political-strategy disclosure—either because disclosure in
many cases will not create any such risk or because the FCC may
promulgate rules requiring disclosure only after any such risk
disappears, or both.

															   Moreover, candidates (or other speakers) whom
§504 affects adversely in this way (or in other ways) remain
free to challenge the lawfulness of FCC implementing regulations
and to challenge the constitutionality of §504 as applied. To
find that the speech-related interests of candidates and others may
be vindicated in an as-applied challenge is not to
“ignor[e]” those interests.

															   Second, The Chief Justice says that “the
Government, in its brief, proffers no interest whatever to support
§504 as a whole,” adding that the existence of
“pre-existing unchallenged agency regulations imposing
similar disclosure requirements” cannot “compel the
conclusion that §504 is constitutional,” nor somehow
“relieve the Government of its burden of advancing a
constitutionally sufficient justification for §504.”
Post, at 12–13 (dissenting opinion).

															   Again The Chief Justice is correct in saying
that the mere existence of similar FCC regulation-imposed
requirements—even if unchallenged for at least 65
years—cannot prove that those requirements are
constitutional. But the existence of those regulations means that
we must read beyond the briefs in this case before holding those
requirements unconstitutional. Before evaluating the relevant
burdens and justifications, we must at least become acquainted with
the FCC’s own view of the matter. We must follow the
Government’s regulation-related references to the relevant
regulatory records, related FCC regulatory conclusions, and the
FCC’s enforcement experience. We must take into account, for
example, the likelihood that the reason there is
“nothing in the record that indicates licensees have treated
purchasers unfairly,” post, at 13 (Rehnquist,
C. J., dissenting), is that for many decades similar FCC
regulations have made that unfair treatment unlawful. And, if we
are to avoid disrupting related agency law, we must evaluate what
we find in agency records and related experience before holding
this similar statutory provision unconstitutional on its face.

															   Even a superficial examination of
those relevant agency materials reveals strong supporting
justifications, and a lack of significant administrative burdens.
And any additional burden that the statute, viewed facially,
imposes upon interests protected by the First Amendment seems
slight compared to the strong enforcement-related interests that it
serves. Given the FCC regulations and their history, the statutory
requirements must survive a facial attack under any
potentially applicable First Amendment standard, including that of
heightened scrutiny.

															   That is why the regulations are relevant. That
is why the brevity of the Government’s discussion here cannot
be determinative. That is why we fear that The Chief
Justice’s contrary view would lead us into an
unfortunate—and at present unjustified—revolution in
communications law. And that is why we disagree with his
dissent.

															   The portion of the judgment of the District
Court invalidating BCRA §504 is reversed.

															It is so ordered.

															APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT

															   Title 47 U. S. C. A.
§315(e) (Supp. 2003), as amended by BCRA §504,
provides:
