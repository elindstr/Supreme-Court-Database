v. AUBREY ELENIS, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the tenth circuit

															[June 30, 2023]

															

															Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Like many States, Colorado has a law forbidding
businesses from engaging in discrimination when they sell goods and
services to the public. Laws along these lines have done much to
secure the civil rights of all Americans. But in this particular
case Colorado does not just seek to ensure the sale of goods or
services on equal terms. It seeks to use its law to compel an
individual to create speech she does not believe. The question we
face is whether that course violates the Free Speech Clause of the
First Amendment.

															I

															A

															Through her business, 303 Creative LLC, Lorie
Smith offers website and graphic design, marketing advice, and
social media management services. Recently, she decided to expand
her offerings to include services for couples seeking websites for
their weddings. As she envisions it, her websites will provide
couples with text, graphic arts, and videos to
“celebrate” and “conve[y ]” the
“details” of their “unique love story.”
App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a, 187a, 198a. The websites will discuss
how the couple met, explain their backgrounds, families, and future
plans, and provide information about their upcoming wedding. All of
the text and graphics on these websites will be
“original,” “customized,” and
“tailored” creations. Id., at 187a. The websites
will be “expressive in nature,” designed “to
communicate a particular message.” Id., at 181a.
Viewers will know, too, “that the websites are [Ms.
Smith’s] original artwork,” for the name of the company
she owns and operates by herself will be displayed on every one.
Id., at 187a.

															While Ms. Smith has laid the groundwork for her
new venture, she has yet to carry out her plans. She worries that,
if she does so, Colorado will force her to express views with which
she disagrees. Ms. Smith provides her website and graphic services
to customers regardless of their race, creed, sex, or sexual
orientation. Id., at 184a. But she has never created
expressions that contradict her own views for anyone—whether
that means generating works that encourage violence, demean another
person, or defy her religious beliefs by, say, promoting atheism.
See ibid.; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–20. Ms. Smith
does not wish to do otherwise now, but she worries Colorado has
different plans. Specifically, she worries that, if she enters the
wedding website business, the State will force her to convey
messages inconsistent with her belief that marriage should be
reserved to unions between one man and one woman. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 177a–190a. Ms. Smith acknowledges that her views about
marriage may not be popular in all quarters. But, she asserts, the
First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause protects her from being
compelled to speak what she does not believe. The Constitution, she
insists, protects her right to differ.

															B

															To clarify her rights, Ms. Smith filed a
lawsuit in federal district court. In that suit, she sought an
injunction to prevent the State from forcing her to create wedding
websites celebrating marriages that defy her beliefs. App.
303–305. To secure relief, Ms. Smith first had to establish
her standing to sue. That required her to show “a credible
threat” existed that Colorado would, in fact, seek to compel
speech from her that she did not wish to produce. Susan B.
Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S.
149, 159 (2014).

															Toward that end, Ms. Smith began by directing
the court to the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA). That law
defines a “public accommodation” broadly to include
almost every public-facing business in the State. Colo. Rev. Stat.
§24–34–601(1) (2022). In what some call its
“Accommodation Clause,” the law prohibits a public
accommodation from denying “the full and equal
enjoyment” of its goods and services to any customer based on
his race, creed, disability, sexual orientation, or other
statutorily enumerated trait. §24–34–601(2)(a).
Either state officials or private citizens may bring actions to
enforce the law. §§24–34–306,
24–34–602(1). And a variety of penalties can follow.
Courts can order fines up to $500 per violation.
§24–34–602(1)(a). The Colorado Commission on Civil
Rights can issue cease-and-desist orders,
§24–34–306(9), and require violators to take
various other “affirmative action[s].”
§24–34–605; §24–34–306(9). In the
past, these have included participation in mandatory educational
programs and the submission of ongoing compliance reports to state
officials. See Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado
Civil Rights Comm’n, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip
op., at 8).[1]

															In her lawsuit, Ms. Smith alleged that, if she
enters the wedding website business to celebrate marriages she does
endorse, she faces a credible threat that Colorado will seek to use
CADA to compel her to create websites celebrating marriages she
does not endorse. 6 F. 4th 1160, 1173–1174 (CA10 2021).
As evidence, Ms. Smith pointed to Colorado’s record of past
enforcement actions under CADA, including one that worked its way
to this Court five years ago. See Masterpiece Cakeshop, 584
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see also App. 25–155
(discussing Colorado’s other past enforcement actions).

															To facilitate the district court’s
resolution of the merits of her case, Ms. Smith and the State
stipulated to a number of facts:

															bullet10Ms. Smith is “willing to work
with all people regardless of classifications such as race, creed,
sexual orientation, and gender,” and she “will gladly
create custom graphics and websites” for clients of any
sexual orientation. App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a.

															bullet10She will not produce content that
“contradicts biblical truth” regardless of who orders
it. Ibid.

															bullet10Her belief that marriage is a union
between one man and one woman is a sincerely held religious
conviction. Id., at 179a.

															bullet10All of the graphic and website design
services Ms. Smith provides are “expressive.”
Id., at 181a.

															bullet10The websites and graphics Ms. Smith
designs are “original, customized” creations that
“contribut[e] to the overall messages” her business
conveys “through the websites” it creates. Id.,
at 181a–182a.

															bullet10Just like the other services she
provides, the wedding websites Ms. Smith plans to create
“will be expressive in nature.” Id., at
187a.

															bullet10Those wedding websites will be
“customized and tailored” through close collaboration
with individual couples, and they will “express Ms.
Smith’s and 303 Creative’s message celebrating and
promoting” her view of marriage. Id., at
186a–187a.

															bullet10Viewers of Ms. Smith’s websites
“will know that the websites are [Ms. Smith’s and 303
Creative’s] original artwork.” Id., at 187a.

															bullet10To the extent Ms. Smith may not be able
to provide certain services to a potential customer, “[t]here
are numerous companies in the State of Colorado and across the
nation that offer custom website design services.”
Id., at 190a.

															C

															Ultimately, the district court ruled against
Ms. Smith. 405 F. Supp. 3d 907, 912 (Colo. 2019). So did the
Tenth Circuit. 6 F. 4th, at 1168. For its part, the Tenth
Circuit held that Ms. Smith had standing to sue. In that
court’s judgment, she had established a credible threat that,
if she follows through on her plans to offer wedding website
services, Colorado will invoke CADA to force her to create speech
she does not believe or endorse. Id., at 1172–1175.
The court pointed to the fact that “Colorado has a history of
past enforcement against nearly identical
conduct—i.e., Masterpiece Cakeshop”; that
anyone in the State may file a complaint against Ms. Smith and
initiate “a potentially burdensome administrative
hearing” process; and that “Colorado [has] decline[d]
to disavow future enforcement” proceedings against her.
Id., at 1174. Before us, no party challenges these
conclusions.

															Turning to the merits, however, the Tenth
Circuit held that Ms. Smith was not entitled to the injunction she
sought. The court acknowledged that Ms. Smith’s planned
wedding websites qualify as “pure speech” protected by
the First Amendment. Id., at 1176. As a result, the court
reasoned, Colorado had to satisfy “strict scrutiny”
before compelling speech from her that she did not wish to create.
Id., at 1178. Under that standard, the court continued, the
State had to show both that forcing Ms. Smith to create speech
would serve a compelling governmental interest and that no less
restrictive alternative exists to secure that interest.
Ibid. Ultimately, a divided panel concluded that the State
had carried these burdens. As the majority saw it, Colorado has a
compelling interest in ensuring “equal access to publicly
available goods and services,” and no option short of
coercing speech from Ms. Smith can satisfy that interest because
she plans to offer “unique services” that are,
“by definition, unavailable elsewhere.” Id., at
1179–1180 (internal quotation marks omitted).

															Chief Judge Tymkovich dissented. He observed
that “ensuring access to a particular
person’s” voice, expression, or artistic talent has
never qualified as “a compelling state interest” under
this Court’s precedents. Id., at 1203. Nor, he
submitted, should courts depart from those precedents now.
“Taken to its logical end,” Chief Judge Tymkovich
warned, his colleagues’ approach would permit the government
to “regulate the messages communicated by all
artists”—a result he called
“unprecedented.” Id., at 1204.

															We granted certiorari to review the Tenth
Circuit’s disposition. 595 U. S. ___ (2022).

															II

															The framers designed the Free Speech Clause of
the First Amendment to protect the “freedom to think as you
will and to speak as you think.” Boy Scouts of America
v. Dale, 530 U.S.
640, 660–661 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).
They did so because they saw the freedom of speech “both as
an end and as a means.” Whitney v. California,
274 U.S.
357, 375 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring); see also 12 The
Papers of James Madison 193–194 (C. Hobson & R. Rutland
eds. 1979). An end because the freedom to think and speak is among
our inalienable human rights. See, e.g., 4 Annals of Cong.
934 (1794) (Rep. Madison). A means because the freedom of thought
and speech is “indispensable to the discovery and spread of
political truth.” Whitney, 274 U. S., at 375
(Brandeis, J., concurring). By allowing all views to flourish, the
framers understood, we may test and improve our own thinking both
as individuals and as a Nation. For all these reasons, “[i]f
there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation,”
West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S.
624, 642 (1943), it is the principle that the government may
not interfere with “an uninhibited marketplace of
ideas,” McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U.S.
464, 476 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).

															From time to time, governments in this country
have sought to test these foundational principles. In
Barnette, for example, the Court faced an effort by the
State of West Virginia to force schoolchildren to salute the
Nation’s flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. If the
students refused, the State threatened to expel them and fine or
jail their parents. Some families objected on the ground that the
State sought to compel their children to express views at odds with
their faith as Jehovah’s Witnesses. When the dispute arrived
here, this Court offered a firm response. In seeking to compel
students to salute the flag and recite a pledge, the Court held,
state authorities had “transcend[ed] constitutional
limitations on their powers.” 319 U. S., at 642. Their
dictates “invade[d] the sphere of intellect and spirit which
it is the purpose of the First Amendment . . . to reserve
from all official control.” Ibid.

															A similar story unfolded in Hurley v.
Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston,
Inc., 515 U.S.
557 (1995). There, veterans organizing a St. Patrick’s
Day parade in Boston refused to include a group of gay, lesbian,
and bisexual individuals in their event. The group argued that
Massachusetts’s public accommodations statute entitled it to
participate in the parade as a matter of law. Id., at
560–561. Lower courts agreed. Id., at 561–566.
But this Court reversed. Id., at 581. Whatever state law may
demand, this Court explained, the parade was constitutionally
protected speech and requiring the veterans to include voices they
wished to exclude would impermissibly require them to “alter
the expressive content of their parade.” Id., at
572–573. The veterans’ choice of what to say (and not
say) might have been unpopular, but they had a First Amendment
right to present their message undiluted by views they did not
share.

															Then there is Boy Scouts of America v.
Dale. In that case, the Boy Scouts excluded James Dale, an
assistant scoutmaster, from membership after learning he was gay.
Mr. Dale argued that New Jersey’s public accommodations law
required the Scouts to reinstate him. 530 U. S., at
644–645. The New Jersey Supreme Court sided with Mr. Dale,
id., at 646–647, but again this Court reversed,
id., at 661. The decision to exclude Mr. Dale may not have
implicated pure speech, but this Court held that the Boy Scouts
“is an expressive association” entitled to First
Amendment protection. Id., at 656. And, the Court found,
forcing the Scouts to include Mr. Dale would “interfere with
[its] choice not to propound a point of view contrary to its
beliefs.” Id., at 654.

															As these cases illustrate, the First Amendment
protects an individual’s right to speak his mind regardless
of whether the government considers his speech sensible and well
intentioned or deeply “misguided,” Hurley, 515
U. S., at 574, and likely to cause “anguish” or
“incalculable grief,” Snyder v. Phelps,
562 U.S.
443, 456 (2011). Equally, the First Amendment protects acts of
expressive association. See, e.g., Dale, 530
U. S., at 647–656; Hurley, 515 U. S., at
568–570, 579. Generally, too, the government may not compel a
person to speak its own preferred messages. See Tinker v.
Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S.
503, 505–506 (1969); see also, e.g., Miami
Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S.
241, 256 (1974); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S.
705, 714 (1977); National Institute of Family and Life
Advocates v. Becerra, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018)
(NIFLA) (slip op., at 8). Nor does it matter whether the
government seeks to compel a person to speak its message when he
would prefer to remain silent or to force an individual to include
other ideas with his own speech that he would prefer not to
include. See Hurley, 515 U. S., at 568–570, 576;
see also Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic &
Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S.
47, 63–64 (2006) (FAIR) (discussing cases). All
that offends the First Amendment just the same.

															III

															Applying these principles to this case, we
align ourselves with much of the Tenth Circuit’s analysis.
The Tenth Circuit held that the wedding websites Ms. Smith seeks to
create qualify as “pure speech” under this
Court’s precedents. 6 F. 4th, at 1176. We agree. It is a
conclusion that flows directly from the parties’
stipulations. They have stipulated that Ms. Smith’s websites
promise to contain “images, words, symbols, and other modes
of expression.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 181a. They have
stipulated that every website will be her “original,
customized” creation. Id., at 181a–182a. And
they have stipulated that Ms. Smith will create these websites to
communicate ideas—namely, to “celebrate and promote the
couple’s wedding and unique love story” and to
“celebrat[e] and promot[e]” what Ms. Smith understands
to be a true marriage. Id., at 186a–187a.

															A hundred years ago, Ms. Smith might have
furnished her services using pen and paper. Those services are no
less protected speech today because they are conveyed with a
“voice that resonates farther than it could from any
soapbox.” Reno v. American Civil Liberties
Union, 521 U.S.
844, 870 (1997). All manner of speech—from
“pictures, films, paintings, drawings, and engravings,”
to “oral utterance and the printed word”—qualify
for the First Amendment’s protections; no less can hold true
when it comes to speech like Ms. Smith’s conveyed over the
Internet. Kaplan v. California, 413 U.S.
115, 119–120 (1973); see also Shurtleff v.
Boston, 596 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2022) (slip op.,
at 7–8) (flags); Brown v. Entertainment Merchants
Assn., 564 U.S.
786, 790 (2011) (video games); Hurley, 515 U. S.,
at 568–570 (parades); Ward v. Rock Against
Racism, 491 U.S.
781, 790 (1989) (music); Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v.
Wilson, 343 U.S.
495, 501–502 (1952) (movies).

															We further agree with the Tenth Circuit that the
wedding websites Ms. Smith seeks to create involve her
speech. 6 F. 4th, at 1181, and n. 5. Again, the
parties’ stipulations lead the way to that conclusion. See
App. to Pet. for Cert. 181a, 187a. As the parties have described
it, Ms. Smith intends to “ve[t]” each prospective
project to determine whether it is one she is willing to endorse.
Id., at 185a. She will consult with clients to discuss
“their unique stories as source material.” Id.,
at 186a. And she will produce a final story for each couple using
her own words and her own “original artwork.”
Id., at 182a–183a. Of course, Ms. Smith’s speech
may combine with the couple’s in the final product. But for
purposes of the First Amendment that changes nothing. An individual
“does not forfeit constitutional protection simply by
combining multifarious voices” in a single communication.
Hurley, 515 U. S., at 569.

															As surely as Ms. Smith seeks to engage in
protected First Amendment speech, Colorado seeks to compel speech
Ms. Smith does not wish to provide. As the Tenth Circuit observed,
if Ms. Smith offers wedding websites celebrating marriages she
endorses, the State intends to “forc[e her] to create custom
websites” celebrating other marriages she does not. 6
F. 4th, at 1178. Colorado seeks to compel this speech in order
to “excis[e] certain ideas or viewpoints from the public
dialogue.” Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
FCC, 512 U.S. 633, 642 (1994). Indeed, the Tenth Circuit
recognized that the coercive “[e]liminati[on]” of
dissenting “ideas” about marriage constitutes
Colorado’s “very purpose” in seeking to apply its
law to Ms. Smith. 6 F. 4th, at 1178.

															We part ways with the Tenth Circuit only when it
comes to the legal conclusions that follow. While that court
thought Colorado could compel speech from Ms. Smith consistent with
the Constitution, our First Amendment precedents laid out above
teach otherwise. In Hurley, the Court found that
Massachusetts impermissibly compelled speech in violation of the
First Amendment when it sought to force parade organizers to accept
participants who would “affec[t] the[ir] message.” 515
U. S., at 572. In Dale, the Court held that New Jersey
intruded on the Boy Scouts’ First Amendment rights when it
tried to require the group to “propound a point of view
contrary to its beliefs” by directing its membership choices.
530 U. S., at 654. And in Barnette, this Court found
impermissible coercion when West Virginia required schoolchildren
to recite a pledge that contravened their convictions on threat of
punishment or expulsion. 319 U. S., at 626–629. Here,
Colorado seeks to put Ms. Smith to a similar choice: If she wishes
to speak, she must either speak as the State demands or face
sanctions for expressing her own beliefs, sanctions that may
include compulsory participation in “remedial . . .
training,” filing periodic compliance reports as officials
deem necessary, and paying monetary fines. App. 120; supra,
at 3. Under our precedents, that “is enough,” more than
enough, to represent an impermissible abridgment of the First
Amendment’s right to speak freely. Hurley, 515
U. S., at 574.

															Consider what a contrary approach would mean.
Under Colorado’s logic, the government may compel anyone who
speaks for pay on a given topic to accept all commissions on that
same topic—no matter the underlying message—if the
topic somehow implicates a customer’s statutorily protected
trait. 6 F. 4th, at 1198 (Tymkovich, C. J., dissenting).
Taken seriously, that principle would allow the government to force
all manner of artists, speechwriters, and others whose services
involve speech to speak what they do not believe on pain of
penalty. The government could require “an unwilling Muslim
movie director to make a film with a Zionist message,” or
“an atheist muralist to accept a commission celebrating
Evangelical zeal,” so long as they would make films or murals
for other members of the public with different messages.
Id., at 1199. Equally, the government could force a male
website designer married to another man to design websites for an
organization that advocates against same-sex marriage. See Brief
for Petitioners 26–27. Countless other creative
professionals, too, could be forced to choose between remaining
silent, producing speech that violates their beliefs, or speaking
their minds and incurring sanctions for doing so. See, e.g.,
Brief for Creative Professionals et al. as Amici Curiae
5–10; Brief for First Amendment Scholars as Amici
Curiae 19–22. As our precedents recognize, the First
Amendment tolerates none of that.

															In saying this much, we do not question the
vital role public accommodations laws play in realizing the civil
rights of all Americans. This Court has recognized that governments
in this country have a “compelling interest” in
eliminating discrimination in places of public accommodation.
Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468
U.S. 609, 628 (1984); see also Hurley, 515 U. S.,
at 571–572. This Court has recognized, too, that public
accommodations laws “vindicate the deprivation of personal
dignity that surely accompanies denials of equal access to public
establishments.” Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.
United States, 379 U.S.
241, 250 (1964) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also,
e.g., Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S.
294 (1964); Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises,
Inc., 390 U.S.
400 (1968) (per curiam).

															Over time, governments in this country have
expanded public accommodations laws in notable ways too. Statutes
like Colorado’s grow from nondiscrimination rules the common
law sometimes imposed on common carriers and places of traditional
public accommodation like hotels and restaurants. Dale, 530
U. S., at 656–657. Often, these enterprises exercised
something like monopoly power or hosted or transported others or
their belongings much like bailees. See, e.g., Liverpool
& Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co.,
129 U.S.
397, 437 (1889); Primrose v. Western Union Telegraph
Co., 154 U.S.
1, 14 (1894). Over time, some States, Colorado included, have
expanded the reach of these nondiscrimination rules to cover
virtually every place of business engaged in any sales to the
public. Compare 1885 Colo. Sess. Laws pp. 132–133 (a short
list of entities originally bound by the State’s public
accommodations law) with Colo. Rev. Stat.
§24–34–601(1) (currently defining a public
accommodation to include “any place of business engaged in
any sales to the public”).

															Importantly, States have also expanded their
laws to prohibit more forms of discrimination. Today, for example,
approximately half the States have laws like Colorado’s that
expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation.[2] And, as we have
recognized, this is entirely “unexceptional.”
Masterpiece Cakeshop, 584 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
10). States may “protect gay persons, just as [they] can
protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever
products and services they choose on the same terms and conditions
as are offered to other members of the public. And there are no
doubt innumerable goods and services that no one could argue
implicate the First Amendment.” Ibid.; see also
Hurley, 515 U. S., at 571–572; 6 F. 4th, at
1203 (Tymkovich, C. J., dissenting). Consistent with all of this,
Ms. Smith herself recognizes that Colorado and other States are
generally free to apply their public accommodations laws, including
their provisions protecting gay persons, to a vast array of
businesses. Reply Brief 15; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 45–46.

															At the same time, this Court has also recognized
that no public accommodations law is immune from the demands of the
Constitution. In particular, this Court has held, public
accommodations statutes can sweep too broadly when deployed to
compel speech. In Hurley, the Court commented favorably on
Massachusetts’ public accommodations law, but made plain it
could not be “applied to expressive activity” to compel
speech. 515 U. S., at 571, 578. In Dale, the Court
observed that New Jersey’s public accommodations law had many
lawful applications but held that it could “not justify such
a severe intrusion on the Boy Scouts’ rights to freedom of
expressive association.” 530 U. S., at 659. And, once
more, what was true in those cases must hold true here. When a
state public accommodations law and the Constitution collide, there
can be no question which must prevail. U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl.
2.

															Nor is it any answer, as the Tenth Circuit
seemed to suppose, that Ms. Smith’s services are
“unique.” 6 F. 4th, at 1180. In some sense, of
course, her voice is unique; so is everyone’s. But that
hardly means a State may coopt an individual’s voice for its
own purposes. In Hurley, the veterans had an
“enviable” outlet for speech; after all, their parade
was a notable and singular event. 515 U. S., at 560,
577–578. In Dale, the Boy Scouts offered what some
might consider a unique experience. 530 U. S., at
649–650. But in both cases this Court held that the State
could not use its public accommodations statute to deny speakers
the right “to choose the content of [their] own
message[s].” Hurley, 515 U. S., at 573; see
Dale, 530 U. S., at 650–656. Were the rule
otherwise, the better the artist, the finer the writer, the more
unique his talent, the more easily his voice could be conscripted
to disseminate the government’s preferred messages. That
would not respect the First Amendment; more nearly, it would spell
its demise.

															IV

															Before us, Colorado appears to distance itself
from the Tenth Circuit’s reasoning. Now, the State seems to
acknowledge that the First Amendment does forbid it from
coercing Ms. Smith to create websites endorsing same-sex marriage
or expressing any other message with which she disagrees. See Brief
for Respondents 12 (disclaiming any interest in
“interfer[ing] with [Ms. Smith’s] choice to offer only
websites of [her] own design”); see also Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 19 (conceding that
“constitutional concerns” would arise if Colorado
“require[d] petitione[r] to design a website” that she
“would not create or convey for any client”). Instead,
Colorado devotes most of its efforts to advancing an alternative
theory for affirmance.

															The State’s alternative theory runs this
way. To comply with Colorado law, the State says, all Ms. Smith
must do is repurpose websites she will create to celebrate
marriages she does endorse for marriages she does
not. She sells a product to some, the State reasons, so she
must sell the same product to all. Brief for Respondents 15, 20. At
bottom, Colorado’s theory rests on a belief that the Tenth
Circuit erred at the outset when it said this case implicates pure
speech. Id., at 19. Instead, Colorado says, this case
involves only the sale of an ordinary commercial product and any
burden on Ms. Smith’s speech is purely
“incidental.” Id., at 18, 25–28; see Tr.
of Oral Arg. 65, 97–98. On the State’s telling, then,
speech more or less vanishes from the picture—and, with it,
any need for First Amendment scrutiny. In places, the dissent seems
to advance the same line of argument. Post, at 29 (opinion
of Sotomayor, J.).

															This alternative theory, however, is difficult
to square with the parties’ stipulations. As we have seen,
the State has stipulated that Ms. Smith does not seek to
sell an ordinary commercial good but intends to create
“customized and tailored” speech for each couple. App.
to Pet. for Cert. 181a, 187a. The State has stipulated that
“[e]ach website 303 Creative designs and creates is an
original, customized creation for each client.” Id.,
at 181a. The State has stipulated, too, that Ms. Smith’s
wedding websites “will be expressive in nature, using text,
graphics, and in some cases videos to celebrate and promote the
couple’s wedding and unique love story.” Id., at
187a. As the case comes to us, then, Colorado seeks to compel just
the sort of speech that it tacitly concedes lies beyond the reach
of its powers.

															Of course, as the State emphasizes, Ms. Smith
offers her speech for pay and does so through 303 Creative LLC, a
company in which she is “the sole member-owner.”
Id., at 181a; see also post, at 33 (opinion of
Sotomayor, J.) (emphasizing Ms. Smith’s
“commercial” activity). But none of that makes a
difference. Does anyone think a speechwriter loses his First
Amendment right to choose for whom he works if he accepts money in
return? Or that a visual artist who accepts commissions from the
public does the same? Many of the world’s great works of
literature and art were created with an expectation of
compensation. Nor, this Court has held, do speakers shed their
First Amendment protections by employing the corporate form to
disseminate their speech. This fact underlies our cases involving
everything from movie producers to book publishers to newspapers.
See, e.g., Joseph Burstyn, Inc., 343 U. S., at
497–503; Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of
N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502
U.S. 105, 114–116 (1991); Grosjean v. American
Press Co., 297 U.S.
233, 240–241, 249 (1936).

															Colorado next urges us to focus on the
reason Ms. Smith refuses to offer the speech it seeks to
compel. She refuses, the State insists, because she objects to the
“protected characteristics” of certain customers. Brief
for Respondents 16; see also post, at 26–27,
31–32 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.) (reciting the same
argument). But once more, the parties’ stipulations speak
differently. The parties agree that Ms. Smith “will gladly
create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, or bisexual
clients or for organizations run by gay, lesbian, or bisexual
persons so long as the custom graphics and websites” do not
violate her beliefs. App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a. That is a
condition, the parties acknowledge, Ms. Smith applies to “all
customers.” Ibid. Ms. Smith stresses, too, that she
has not and will not create expressions that defy any of her
beliefs for any customer, whether that involves encouraging
violence, demeaning another person, or promoting views inconsistent
with her religious commitments. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18–20.
Nor, in any event, do the First Amendment’s protections
belong only to speakers whose motives the government finds worthy;
its protections belong to all, including to speakers whose motives
others may find misinformed or offensive. See Federal Election
Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U.S.
449, 468–469 (2007) (opinion of Roberts, C. J.)
(observing that “a speaker’s motivation is entirely
irrelevant” (internal quotation marks omitted)); National
Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S.
43, 43–44 (1977) (per curiam) (upholding
free-speech rights of participants in a Nazi parade);
Snyder, 562 U. S., at 456–457 (same for
protestors of a soldier’s funeral).[3]

															Failing all else, Colorado suggests that this
Court’s decision in FAIR supports affirmance. See also
post, at 25–26 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.) (making the
same argument). In FAIR, a group of schools challenged a law
requiring them, as a condition of accepting federal funds, to
permit military recruiters space on campus on equal terms with
other potential employers. 547 U. S., at 51–52, 58. The
only expressive activity required of the law schools, the Court
found, involved the posting of logistical notices along these
lines: “ ‘The U. S. Army recruiter will meet
interested students in Room 123 at 11 a.m.’ ”
Id., at 61–62. And, the Court reasoned, compelled
speech of this sort was “incidental” and a “far
cry” from the speech at issue in our “leading First
Amendment precedents [that] have established the principle that
freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what
they must say.” Ibid.; see also NIFLA, 585
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).

															It is a far cry from this case too. To be sure,
our cases have held that the government may sometimes
“requir[e] the dissemination of purely factual and
uncontroversial information,” particularly in the context of
“commercial advertising.” Hurley, 515
U. S., at 573 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also
NIFLA, 585 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8); Riley
v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc.,
487 U.S.
781, 795–796 (1988). But this case involves nothing like
that. Here, Colorado does not seek to impose an incidental burden
on speech. It seeks to force an individual to “utter what is
not in [her] mind” about a question of political and
religious significance. Barnette, 319 U. S., at 634.
And that, FAIR reaffirmed, is something the First Amendment
does not tolerate. No government, FAIR recognized, may
affect a “speaker’s message” by
“forc[ing]” her to “accommodate” other
views, 547 U. S., at 63; no government may
“ ‘alter’ ” the
“ ‘expressive content’ ” of her
message, id., at 63–64 (alteration omitted); and no
government may “interfer[e] with” her “desired
message,” id., at 64.

															V

															It is difficult to read the dissent and
conclude we are looking at the same case. Much of it focuses on the
evolution of public accommodations laws, post, at
7–13, and the strides gay Americans have made towards
securing equal justice under law, post, at 14–17. And,
no doubt, there is much to applaud here. But none of this answers
the question we face today: Can a State force someone who provides
her own expressive services to abandon her conscience and speak
its preferred message instead?

															When the dissent finally gets around to that
question—more than halfway into its opinion—it
reimagines the facts of this case from top to bottom. The dissent
claims that Colorado wishes to regulate Ms. Smith’s
“conduct,” not her speech. Post, at 24–29.
Forget Colorado’s stipulation that Ms. Smith’s
activities are “expressive,” App. to Pet. for Cert.
181a, and the Tenth Circuit’s conclusion that the State seeks
to compel “pure speech,” 6 F. 4th, at 1176. The
dissent chides us for deciding a pre-enforcement challenge.
Post, at 23. But it ignores the Tenth Circuit’s
finding that Ms. Smith faces a credible threat of sanctions unless
she conforms her views to the State’s. 6 F. 4th, at
1172–1175. The dissent suggests (over and over again) that
any burden on speech here is “incidental.” Post,
at 24, 26–30, 32–33. All despite the Tenth
Circuit’s finding that Colorado intends to force Ms. Smith to
convey a message she does not believe with the “very
purpose” of “[e]liminating . . . ideas”
that differ from its own. 6 F. 4th, at 1178.[4]

															Nor does the dissent’s reimagination end
there. It claims that, “for the first time in its
history,” the Court “grants a business open to the
public” a “right to refuse to serve members of a
protected class.” Post, at 1; see also id., at
26, n. 10, 35. Never mind that we do no such thing and
Colorado itself has stipulated Ms. Smith will (as CADA
requires) “work with all people regardless of . . .
sexual orientation.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a. Never mind,
too, that it is the dissent that would have this Court do something
truly novel by allowing a government to coerce an individual to
speak contrary to her beliefs on a significant issue of personal
conviction, all in order to eliminate ideas that differ from its
own.

															There is still more. The dissent asserts that we
“sweep under the rug petitioners’ challenge to
CADA’s Communication Clause.” Post, at 26. This
despite the fact the parties and the Tenth Circuit recognized that
Ms. Smith’s Communication Clause challenge hinges on her
Accommodation Clause challenge. (So much so that Colorado devoted
less than two pages at the tail end of its brief to the
Communication Clause and the Tenth Circuit afforded it just three
paragraphs in its free-speech analysis. See Brief for Respondents
44–45; 6 F. 4th, at 1182–1183.)[5] The dissent even suggests that our
decision today is akin to endorsing a “separate but
equal” regime that would allow law firms to refuse women
admission into partnership, restaurants to deny service to Black
Americans, or businesses seeking employees to post something like a
“White Applicants Only” sign. Post, at 1,
16–21, 26, 28–29, 32, and n. 13, 37. Pure fiction
all.

															In some places, the dissent gets so turned
around about the facts that it opens fire on its own position. For
instance: While stressing that a Colorado company cannot refuse
“the full and equal enjoyment of [its] services” based
on a customer’s protected status, post, at 27, the
dissent assures us that a company selling creative services
“to the public” does have a right “to
decide what messages to include or not to include,”
post, at 28. But if that is true, what are we even
debating?

															Instead of addressing the parties’
stipulations about the case actually before us, the dissent spends
much of its time adrift on a sea of hypotheticals about
photographers, stationers, and others, asking if they too provide
expressive services covered by the First Amendment. Post, at
27–29, 31–32, 37. But those cases are not this
case. Doubtless, determining what qualifies as expressive activity
protected by the First Amendment can sometimes raise difficult
questions. But this case presents no complication of that kind. The
parties have stipulated that Ms. Smith seeks to engage in
expressive activity. And the Tenth Circuit has recognized her
services involve “pure speech.” See supra, at 6,
9. Nothing the dissent says can alter this—nor can it
displace the First Amendment protections that follow.

															The dissent’s treatment of precedent
parallels its handling of the facts. Take its remarkable suggestion
that a government forcing an individual to create speech on weighty
issues with which she disagrees—all, as the Tenth Circuit
found, with the goal of “[e]liminating” views it does
not share, 6 F. 4th, at 1178—only
“incidental[ly]” burdens First Amendment liberties.
Post, at 26–35. Far from embracing a notion
like that, our cases have rejected it time after
time—including in the context of public accommodations laws.
See Parts II–IV, supra; FAIR, 547 U. S.,
at 61–64 (no government may affect a “speaker’s
own message” by “forc[ing]” her to
“accommodate” views she does not hold); Hurley,
515 U. S., at 563, 566 (using a public accommodations law to
compel parade organizers to include speech they did not believe was
no mere “ ‘incidental’ ”
infringement on First Amendment rights); Dale, 530
U. S., at 659 (employing a public accommodations law to
require the Boy Scouts to alter their admissions policies had more
than “an incidental effect on protected
speech”).[6]

															When it finally gets around to discussing these
controlling precedents, the dissent offers a wholly unpersuasive
attempt to distinguish them. The First Amendment protections
furnished in Barnette, Hurley, and Dale, the
dissent declares, were limited to schoolchildren and
“nonprofit[s],” and it is “dispiriting” to
think they might also apply to Ms. Smith’s
“commercial” activity. Post, at 32–35. But
our precedents endorse nothing like the limits the dissent would
project on them. Instead, as we have seen, the First Amendment
extends to all persons engaged in expressive conduct, including
those who seek profit (such as speechwriters, artists, and website
designers). See supra, at 16–17. If anything is truly
dispiriting here, it is the dissent’s failure to take
seriously this Court’s enduring commitment to protecting the
speech rights of all comers, no matter how controversial—or
even repugnant—many may find the message at hand.

															Finally, the dissent comes out and says what it
really means: Once Ms. Smith offers some speech, Colorado
“would require [her] to create and sell speech,
notwithstanding [her] sincere objection to doing
so”—and the dissent would force her to comply with that
demand. Post, at 29–30. Even as it does so, however,
the dissent refuses to acknowledge where its reasoning leads. In a
world like that, as Chief Judge Tymkovich highlighted, governments
could force “an unwilling Muslim movie director to make a
film with a Zionist message,” they could compel “an
atheist muralist to accept a commission celebrating Evangelical
zeal,” and they could require a gay website designer to
create websites for a group advocating against same-sex marriage,
so long as these speakers would accept commissions from the public
with different messages. 6 F. 4th, at 1199 (dissenting
opinion). Perhaps the dissent finds these possibilities untroubling
because it trusts state governments to coerce only
“enlightened” speech. But if that is the calculation,
it is a dangerous one indeed.[7]

															The dissent is right about one
thing—“[w]hat a difference” time can make. See
post, at 2 (internal quotation marks omitted). Eighty years
ago in Barnette, this Court affirmed that “no
official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in
politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of
opinion.” 319 U. S., at 642. The Court did so despite
the fact that the speech rights it defended were deeply unpopular;
at the time, the world was at war and many thought respect for the
flag and the pledge “essential for the welfare of the
state.” Id., at 662–663 (Frankfurter, J.,
dissenting); see also id., at 636, 640 (majority opinion).
Fifty years ago, this Court protected the right of Nazis to march
through a town home to many Holocaust survivors and along the way
espouse ideas antithetical to those for which this Nation stands.
See Skokie, 432 U. S., at 43–44; supra, at
17–18. Five years ago, in a case the dissenters highlight at
the outset of their opinion, the Court stressed that “it is
not . . . the role of the State or its officials to
prescribe what shall be offensive.” Masterpiece
Cakeshop, 584 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 16). And just
days ago, Members of today’s dissent joined in holding that
the First Amendment restricts how States may prosecute stalkers
despite the “harm[ful],” “low-value,” and
“upsetting” nature of their speech. Counterman
v. Colorado, 600 U. S. ___, ___ (2023) (slip op., at
6); id., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 5).

															Today, however, the dissent abandons what this
Court’s cases have recognized time and time again: A
commitment to speech for only some messages and some
persons is no commitment at all. By approving a government’s
effort to “[e]liminat[e]” disfavored
“ideas,” 6 F. 4th, at 1178, today’s dissent
is emblematic of an unfortunate tendency by some to defend First
Amendment values only when they find the speaker’s message
sympathetic. But “[i]f liberty means anything at all, it
means the right to tell people what they do not want to
hear.” 6 F. 4th, at 1190 (Tymkovich, C. J.,
dissenting) (quoting G. Orwell).

															*

															In this case, Colorado seeks to force an
individual to speak in ways that align with its views but defy her
conscience about a matter of major significance. In the past, other
States in Barnette, Hurley, and Dale have
similarly tested the First Amendment’s boundaries by seeking
to compel speech they thought vital at the time. But, as this Court
has long held, the opportunity to think for ourselves and to
express those thoughts freely is among our most cherished liberties
and part of what keeps our Republic strong. Of course, abiding the
Constitution’s commitment to the freedom of speech means all
of us will encounter ideas we consider “unattractive,”
post, at 38 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), “misguided, or
even hurtful,” Hurley, 515 U. S., at 574. But
tolerance, not coercion, is our Nation’s answer. The First
Amendment envisions the United States as a rich and complex place
where all persons are free to think and speak as they wish, not as
the government demands. Because Colorado seeks to deny that
promise, the judgment is

															

															Reversed.

Notes
1
 In addition to the
Accommodation Clause, CADA contains a “Com-munication
Clause” that prohibits a public accommodation from
“publish[ing] . . . any written . . .
communication” indicating that a person will be denied
“the full and equal enjoyment” of services or that he
will be “unwelcome, objectionable, unacceptable, or
undesirable” based on a pro-tected classification. Colo. Rev.
Stat. §24–34–601(2)(a) (2022). The Communication
Clause, Ms. Smith notes, prohibits any speech inconsistent with the
Accommodation Clause. Because Colorado concedes that its authority
to apply the Communication Clause to Ms. Smith stands or falls with
its authority to apply the Accommodation Clause, see Brief for
Respondents 44–45, we focus our attention on the
Accommodation Clause.

The dissent labels the
distinction between status and message “amusing” and
“embarrassing.” Post, at 32. But in doing so,
the dissent ignores a fundamental feature of the Free Speech
Clause. While it does not protect status-based
discrimination unrelated to expression, generally it does
protect a speaker’s right to control her own
message—even when we may disapprove of the speaker’s
motive or the message itself. The dissent’s derision is no
answer to any of this. It ignores, too, the fact that Colorado
itself has, in other contexts, distinguished status-based
discrimination (forbidden) from the right of a speaker to control
his own message (protected). See App. 131, 137, 140, 143–144,
149, 152, 154. (Truth be told, even the dissent acknowledges
“th[is] distinction” elsewhere in its opinion.
Post, at 31, n. 11.) Nor is the distinction unusual in
societies committed both to nondiscrimination rules and free
expression. See, e.g., Lee v. Ashers Baking Co.
Ltd., [2018] UKSC 49, p. 14 (“The less favourable
treatment was afforded to the message not to the man.”). Does
the dissent really find all that amusing and
embarrassing?
4
Perplexingly, too, the dissent
suggests that, by recounting the Tenth Circuit’s conclusion
on this score, we “misunderstan[d] this case” and
“invo[ke] . . . Orwellian thought policing.”
Post, at 34, n. 14.
5
Why does the dissent try to
refocus this case around the Communication Clause? Perhaps because
the moment one acknowledges the parties’
stipulations—and the fact Colorado seeks to use its
Accommodation Clause to compel speech in order to ensure conformity
to its own views on a topic of major significance—the First
Amendment implications become obvious. As does the fact that our
case is nothing like a typical application of a public
accommodations law requiring an ordinary, non-expressive business
to serve all customers or consider all applicants. Our decision
today does not concern—much less endorse—anything like
the “ ‘straight couples only’ ”
notices the dissent conjures out of thin air. Post, at 26,
n. 10. Nor do the parties discuss anything of the sort in
their stipulations.
6
The dissent observes that
public accommodations laws may sometimes touch on speech
incidentally as they work to ensure ordinary, non-expressive goods
and services are sold on equal terms. Cf. post, at
24–27 (citing Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.,
564 U.S.
552 (2011); Rumsfeld v. FAIR, 547 U.S.
47 (2006); United States v. O’Brien,
391 U.S.
367 (1968)). But as Hurley observed, there is nothing
“incidental” about an infringement on speech when a
public accommodations law is applied “peculiar[ly]” to
compel expressive activity. Hurley v. Irish-American Gay,
Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U.S.
557, 572 (1995).The dissent notes that our case law has not
sustained every First Amendment objection to an antidiscrimination
rule, as with a law firm that sought to exclude women from
partnership. Post, at 19–21 (citing Hishon v.
King & Spalding, 467 U.S.
69 (1984); Roberts v. United States Jaycees,
468 U.S.
609 (1984)). But the dissent disregards Dale’s
holding that context matters and that very different considerations
come into play when a law is used to force individuals to toe the
government’s preferred line when speaking (or associating to
express themselves) on matters of significance. Boy Scouts of
America v. Dale, 530 U.S.
640, 648–653 (2000).
7
Perhaps the dissent finds these
possibilities untroubling for another reason. It asserts that CADA
does not apply to “[m]any filmmakers, visual artists, and
writers” because they do not “hold out” their
services to the public. Post, at 27. But the dissent cites
nothing to support its claim and instead, once more, fights the
facts. As we have seen, Colorado’s law today applies to
“any place of business engaged in any sales to
the public.” Colo. Rev. Stat. §24–34–601(1)
(emphasis added); see also Part III, supra. And the dissent
can hardly dispute that many artists and writers accept commissions
from the public. Brief for Creative Professionals et al. as
Amici Curiae 5–21. Certainly, Colorado does not
advance anything like the dissent’s argument; it calls any
exemption to its law for “artists” and others who
provide “custom” services “unworkable.”
