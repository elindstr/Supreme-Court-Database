SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-221

															CHERYL K. PLILER, WARDEN, PETITIONER v.
RICHARD HERMAN FORD

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 21, 2004]

															   Justice Stevens, with whom
Justice Souter joins, concurring in the judgment.

															   While I fully agree with the
views expressed by Justice Ginsburg, post, p. 1, and
Justice Breyer, post, p. 1 (dissenting opinions), I
am persuaded that the judgment entered by the Court—remanding
to the Ninth Circuit to determine the propriety of equitable
tolling—is both consistent with those views and correct. I
therefore concur in that judgment.
