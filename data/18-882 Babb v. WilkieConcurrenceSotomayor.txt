															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 18–882

															_________________

															NORIS BABB, PETITIONER v. ROBERT WILKIE, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

															[April 6, 2020]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.

															I join the majority opinion because I agree that

29 U. S. C. §633a imposes liability even when age is not a “ ‘but-for cause’ ” of a personnel action.  Ante, at 1.  I write separately to make two observations.

															First, the Court does not foreclose §633a claims arising from discriminatory processes.  Cf. Comcast Corp. v. National Assn. of African American-Owned Media, ante, p. ___ (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  If, for example, an employer hires a 50-year-old person who passed a computer-aptitude test administered only to applicants above 40, clearly a question could arise as to whether the hiring decision was “made free from” differential treatment.

															Second, this same example may suggest that §633a permits damages remedies, even when the Government engages in nondispositive “age discrimination in the ‘ma[king]’ of a personnel decision.”  Ante, at 10.  If an applicant incurs costs to prepare for the discriminatorily administered aptitude test, a damages award compensating for such out-of-pocket expenses could restore the applicant to the “position tha[t] he or she would have enjoyed absent discrimination.”  Ante, at 14.
