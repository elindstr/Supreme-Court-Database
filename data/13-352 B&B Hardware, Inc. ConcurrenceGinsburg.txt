															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
															_________________
															No. 13–352
															_________________
															B & B HARDWARE, INC., PETITIONER v. HARGIS INDUSTRIES, INC., dba SEALTITE BUILDING FASTENERS, dba EAST TEXAS FASTENERS et al.
															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit
															[March 24, 2015]
															                    Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
															                    The Court rightly recognizes that “for a great many registration decisions issue preclusion obviously will not apply.”  Ante, at 14–15.  That is so because contested registrations are often decided upon “a comparison of the marks in the abstract and apart from their marketplace usage.”  6 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition §32:101, p. 32–247 (4th ed. 2014).  When the registration proceeding is of that character, “there will be no [preclusion] of the likel[ihood] of confusion issue . . . in a later infringement suit.”  Ibid.  On that understanding, I join the Court’s opinion.
