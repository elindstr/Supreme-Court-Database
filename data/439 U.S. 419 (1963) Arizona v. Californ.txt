															PER CURIAM AND SUPPLEMENTAL DECREE.

															The United States of America, Intervenor, State of Arizona, Complainant, the California Defendants (State of California, Palo Verde Irrigation District, Imperial Irrigation District, Coachella Valley County Water District, The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, City of Los Angeles, City of San Diego, County of San Diego), and State of Nevada, Intervenor, pursuant to Art. VI of the Decree entered in the case on March 9, 1964, at  376 U. S. 376 U.S. 340, and amended on February 28, 1966, at  383 U. S. 383 U.S. 268, have agreed to the present perfected rights to the use of mainstream water in each State and their priority dates as set forth herein.  Therefore, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the joint motion of the United States, the State of Arizona, the California Defendants, and the State of Nevada to enter a supplemental decree is granted, and that said present 
															Page 439 U. S. 421
															 perfected rights in each State and their priority dates are determined to be as set forth below, subject to the following:

															"(1) The following listed present perfected rights relate to the quantity of water which may be used by each claimant, and the list is not intended to limit or redefine the type of use otherwise set forth in said Decree."

															"(2) This determination shall in no way affect future adjustments resulting from determinations relating to settlement of Indian reservation boundaries referred to in Art. II(D)(5) of said Decree."

															"(3) Article IX of said Decree is not affected by this list of present perfected rights."

															"(4) Any water right listed herein may be exercised only for beneficial uses."

															"(5) In the event of a determination of insufficient mainstream water to satisfy present perfected rights pursuant to Art. II(b)(3) of said Decree, the Secretary of the Interior shall, before providing for the satisfaction of any of the other present perfected rights except for those listed herein as 'MISCELLANEOUS PRESENT PERFECTED RIGHTS' (rights numbered 7-21 and 29-80 below) in the order of their priority dates without regard to State lines, first provide for the satisfaction in full of all rights of the Chemehuevi Indian Reservation, Cocopah Indian Reservation, Fort Yuma Indian Reservation, Colorado River Indian Reservation, and the Fort Mojave Indian Reservation as set forth in Art. II(D)(1)-(5) of said Decree, provided that the quantities fixed in paragraphs (1) through( 5) of Art. II(D) of said Decree shall continue to be subject to appropriate adjustment by agreement or decree of this Court in the event that the boundaries of the respective reservations are finally determined.  Additional present perfected rights so adjudicated by such adjustment shall be in annual quantities not to exceed the quantities of mainstream water necessary to 
															Page 439 U. S. 422
															 supply the consumptive use required for irrigation of the practicably irrigable acres which are included within any area determined to be within a reservation by such final determination of a boundary and for the satisfaction of related uses.  The quantities of diversions are to be computed by determining net practicably irrigable acres within each additional area using the methods set forth by the Special Master in this case in his Report to this Court dated December 5, 1960, and by applying the unit diversion quantities thereto, as listed below:"

															Unit Diversion

															Quantity Acre-Feet

															Per Irrigable Acre

															------------------

															Cocopah                      6.37

															Colorado River               6.67

															Chemehuevi                   5.97

															Ft. Mojave                   6.46

															Ft. Yuma                     6.67

															"The foregoing reference to a quantity of water necessary to supply consumptive use required for irrigation, and as that provision is included within paragraphs (1) through (5) of Art. II(D) of said Decree, shall constitute the means of determining quantity of adjudicated water rights, but shall not constitute a restriction of the usage of them to irrigation or other agricultural application.  If all or part of the adjudicated water rights of any of the five Indian Reservations is used other than for irrigation or other agricultural application, the total consumptive use, as that term is defined in Art. I(A) of said Decree, for said Reservation shall not exceed the consumptive use that would have resulted if the diversions listed in subparagraph (i) of paragraphs (1) through (5) of Art. II(D) of said Decree and the equivalent portions of any supplement thereto had been used for irrigation of the number of acres specified for that Reservation in said paragraphs and supplement and 
															Page 439 U. S. 423
															 for the satisfaction of related uses.  Effect shall be given to this paragraph notwithstanding the priority dates of the present perfected rights as listed below.  However, nothing in this paragraph (5) shall affect the order in which such rights listed below as 'MISCELLANEOUS PRESENT PERFECTED RIGHTS' (numbered 7-21 and 29-80 below) shall be satisfied.  Furthermore, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to determine the order of satisfying any other Indian water rights claims not herein specified."
