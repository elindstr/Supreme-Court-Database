															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER

															13–212      v.

															BRIMA WURIE

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the first circuit

															[June 25, 2014]

															

															     Justice Alito,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															     I agree with the Court
that law enforcement officers, in conducting a lawful search
incident to arrest, must generally obtain a warrant before
searching information stored or accessible on a cell phone. I write
separately to address two points.

															I

															A

															     First, I am not
convinced at this time that the ancient rule on searches incident
to arrest is based exclusively (or even primarily) on the need to
protect the safety of arresting officers and the need to prevent
the destruction of evidence. Cf. ante, at 9. This rule antedates
the adoption of the Fourth Amendment by at least a century. See T.
Clancy, The Fourth Amendment: Its History and Interpretation 340
(2008); T. Taylor, Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation 28
(1969); Amar, Fourth Amendment First Principles, 107 Harv. L. Rev.
757, 764 (1994). In Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 392
(1914) , we held that the Fourth Amendment did not disturb this
rule. See also Taylor, supra, at 45; Stuntz, The Substantive
Origins of Criminal Procedure, 105 Yale L. J. 393, 401 (1995)
(“The power to search incident to arrest—a search of
the arrested suspect’s person . . .—was well
established in the mid-eighteenth century, and nothing in
. . . the Fourth Amendment changed that”). And
neither in Weeks nor in any of the authorities discussing the old
common-law rule have I found any suggestion that it was based
exclusively or primarily on the need to protect arresting officers
or to prevent the destruction of evidence.

															     On the contrary, when
pre-Weeks authorities discussed the basis for the rule, what was
mentioned was the need to obtain probative evidence. For example,
an 1839 case stated that “it is clear, and beyond doubt, that
. . . constables . . . are entitled, upon a
lawful arrest by them of one charged with treason or felony, to
take and detain prop-erty found in his possession which will form
material evi-dence in his prosecution for that crime.” See
Dillon v. O’Brien, 16 Cox Crim. Cas. 245, 249–251
(1887) (citing Regina, v. Frost, 9 Car. & P. 129, 173 Eng. Rep.
771)). The court noted that the origins of that rule
“deriv[e] from the interest which the State has in a person
guilty (or reasonably believed to be guilty) of a crime being
brought to justice, and in a prosecution, once commenced, being
determined in due course of law.” 16 Cox Crim. Cas., at
249–250. See also Holker v. Hennessey, 141 Mo. 527,
537–540, 42 S. W. 1090, 1093 (1897).

															     Two 19th-century
treatises that this Court has previ-ously cited in connection with
the origin of the search-incident-to-arrest rule, see Weeks, supra,
at 392, suggest the same rationale. See F. Wharton, Criminal
Pleading and Practice §60, p. 45 (8th ed. 1880) (“Those
arresting a defendant are bound to take from his person any
articles which may be of use as proof in the trial of the offense
with which the defendant is charged”); J. Bishop, Criminal
Procedure §§210–212, p. 127 (2d ed. 1872) (if an
arresting officer finds “about the prisoner’s person,
or otherwise in his possession, either goods or moneys which there
is reason to believe are connected with the supposed crime as its
fruits, or as the instruments with which it was committed, or as
directly furnishing evidence relating to the transaction, he may
take the same, and hold them to be disposed of as the court may
direct”).

															     What ultimately
convinces me that the rule is not closely linked to the need for
officer safety and evidence preser-vation is that these rationales
fail to explain the rule’s well-recognized scope. It has long
been accepted that written items found on the person of an arrestee
may be examined and used at trial.[1]* But once these items are taken away from an arrestee
(something that obviously must be done before the items are read),
there is no risk that the arrestee will destroy them. Nor is there
any risk that leaving these items unread will endanger the
arresting officers.

															     The idea that officer
safety and the preservation of evidence are the sole reasons for
allowing a warrantless search incident to arrest appears to derive
from the Court’s reasoning in Chimel v. California, 395
U. S. 752 (1969) , a case that involved the lawfulness of a
search of the scene of an arrest, not the person of an arrestee. As
I have explained, Chimel’s reasoning is questionable, see
Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332 –363 (2009) (Alito, J.,
dissenting), and I think it is a mistake to allow that reasoning to
affect cases like these that concern the search of the person of
arrestees.

															B

															     Despite my view on
the point discussed above, I agree that we should not mechanically
apply the rule used in the predigital era to the search of a cell
phone. Many cell phones now in use are capable of storing and
accessing a quantity of information, some highly personal, that no
person would ever have had on his person in hard-copy form. This
calls for a new balancing of law enforcement and privacy
interests.

															     The Court strikes this
balance in favor of privacy interests with respect to all cell
phones and all information found in them, and this approach leads
to anomalies. For example, the Court’s broad holding favors
information in digital form over information in hard-copy form.
Suppose that two suspects are arrested. Suspect number one has in
his pocket a monthly bill for his land-line phone, and the bill
lists an incriminating call to a long-distance number. He also has
in his a wallet a few snapshots, and one of these is incriminating.
Suspect number two has in his pocket a cell phone, the call log of
which shows a call to the same incriminating number. In addition, a
number of photos are stored in the memory of the cell phone, and
one of these is incriminating. Under established law, the police
may seize and examine the phone bill and the snapshots in the
wallet without obtaining a warrant, but under the Court’s
holding today, the information stored in the cell phone is out.

															     While the Court’s
approach leads to anomalies, I do not see a workable alternative.
Law enforcement officers need clear rules regarding searches
incident to arrest, and it would take many cases and many years for
the courts to develop more nuanced rules. And during that time, the
nature of the electronic devices that ordinary Americans carry on
their persons would continue to change.

															II

															     This brings me to my
second point. While I agree with the holding of the Court, I would
reconsider the question presented here if either Congress or state
legislatures, after assessing the legitimate needs of law
enforcement and the privacy interests of cell phone owners, enact
legislation that draws reasonable distinctions based on categories
of information or perhaps other variables.

															     The regulation of
electronic surveillance provides an instructive example. After this
Court held that electronic surveillance constitutes a search even
when no property interest is invaded, see Katz v. United States,
389 U. S. 347 –359 (1967), Congress responded by
enacting Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act of 1968, 82Stat. 211. See also 18 U. S. C. §2510
et seq. Since that time, electronic surveillance has been
governed primarily, not by decisions of this Court, but by the
stat-ute, which authorizes but imposes detailed restrictions on
electronic surveillance. See ibid.

															     Modern cell phones are
of great value for both lawful and unlawful purposes. They can be
used in committing many serious crimes, and they present new and
difficult law enforcement problems. See Brief for United States in
No. 13–212, pp. 2–3. At the same time, because of the
role that these devices have come to play in contemporary life,
searching their contents implicates very sensitive privacy
interests that this Court is poorly positioned to understand and
evaluate. Many forms of modern technology are making it easier and
easier for both government and private entities to amass a wealth
of information about the lives of ordinary Americans, and at the
same time, many ordinary Americans are choosing to make public much
information that was seldom revealed to outsiders just a few
decades ago.

															     In light of these
developments, it would be very unfortunate if privacy protection in
the 21st century were left primarily to the federal courts using
the blunt instrument of the Fourth Amendment. Legislatures, elected
by the people, are in a better position than we are to assess and
respond to the changes that have already occurred and those that
almost certainly will take place in the future.
