															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, PETITIONER v. ROBERT J.
MacLEAN

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the federal circuit

															[January 21, 2015]

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kennedy joins,
dissenting.

															I agree with much of the Courtâ€™s opinion. I
have no qualms with the Courtâ€™s conclusion that
the phrase â€œspecifically prohibited by
law,â€ as used in the Whistleblower Protection Act of
1989 (WPA),5 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§2302(b)(8)(A), does not encompass disclosures
prohibited only by regulation. See ante, at 7. Nor do I see
any problem in the distinction the Court draws between statutes
that prohibit information from being disclosed, the
violation of which may preclude application of the WPA, and
statutes that simply exempt information from
otherwise-applicable disclosure requirements, which do not trigger
the WPAâ€™s â€œprohibited by
lawâ€ exception. See ante, at
12â€“13.

															I part ways with the Court, however, when it concludes that49
U.Â S.Â C. Â§114(r)(1) does not
itself prohibit the type of disclosure at issue
hereâ€”the release of information regarding the
absence of federal air marshals on overnight flights. Ante,
at 11. That statute provides, in relevant part, that the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA)
â€œshall prescribe regulations prohibiting
the disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out
security .Â .Â . if the Under Secretary
decides that disclosing the information would
.Â .Â . be detrimental to the security of
transportation.â€ Â§114(r)(1) (emphasis
added).

															The Court reasons, first, that Section 114(r)(1) does not
â€œprohibit anything,â€ but instead
simply â€œauthorizesâ€ the TSA
to prescribe regulations. Ante, at 11. But this contention
overlooks the statuteâ€™s use of the word
â€œshall,â€ which, as we have observed,
â€œgenerally means
â€˜must.â€™Â â€
Gutierrez de Martinez v. Lamagno,515
U.Â S. 417,432, n.9 (1995); see also, e.g.,
Federal. Express Corp. v. Holowecki,552
U.Â S. 389,400 (2008)
(â€œCongressâ€™ use of the term
â€˜shallâ€™ indicates an intent
to â€˜impose discretionless
obligationsâ€™Â â€) (some
internal quotation marks omitted)); A. Scalia & B. Garner,
Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 114 (2012)
(â€œ[W]hen the word shall can reasonably
read as mandatory, it ought to be so readâ€). Section
114(r)(1) does not merely authorize the TSA to promulgate
regulations; it directs it to do so, and describes what those
regulations must accomplish.

															The Court focuses, second, on the fact that Section 114(r)
authorizes the TSA to
â€œÂ â€˜decid[e]â€™Â â€
whether the disclosure of a particular item of information would in
fact be
â€œÂ â€˜detrimental to
the security of
transportation.â€™Â â€
Ante, at 11â€“12 (emphasis deleted). I
certainly agree that this language vests some discretion in the
agency.[1] But the agency is required to prevent
the disclosure of any information it determines is within
Congressâ€™ prohibition; its discretion pertains
only to identifying whether a particular piece of
information falls within the scope of Congressâ€™
command. In concluding that such residual agency discretion
deprives Section 114(r) of prohibitory effect, the Court overlooks
the degree of agency involvement that is necessary in the
administration of many antidisclosure statutes. Congress cannot be
expected to identify with particularity each individual document or
datum the release of which it wants to preclude. Often, it will
have to leave to an agency or other enforcing authority the tasks
of definingâ€”perhaps through
regulationsâ€”exactly what type of information
falls within the scope of the congressional prohibition, and of
determining whether a particular item of information fits the bill.
The enforcing authority may, as the Court puts it, sometimes be
required to make some â€œfine-grained
distinction[s]â€ in fulfilling this charge, ante,
at 12, but that does not change the fact that Congress itself is
the source of the prohibition on disclosure.[2]

															Indeed, Congress appears to have anticipated the need for agency
involvement in the interpretation and enforcement of antidisclosure
statutes at the time it enacted the WPA. The Senate Report to the
WPA identified only two statutes the violation of which would
preclude whistleblower protection, the first being Section
102(d)(3) of the National Security Act of 1947,61Stat.498, which
pro-vided that â€œthe Director of Central
Intelligence shall be re-sponsible for protecting intelligence
sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.â€ See
S. Rep. No. 95â€“969, pp. 21â€“22
(1978). This example clearly suggests Congress contemplated that a
statute directing an agency to protect against disclosures and
delegating substantial authority to the agency should nevertheless
be deemed to impose the relevant prohibition. Section
114(r)(1)â€™s delegation to the TSA to
â€œdecideâ€ whether the release of
particular information would be â€œdetrimental to
the security of transportationâ€ likewise simply
reflects Congressâ€™ recognition of the inevitable
fact that the agency will be tasked, in the first instance, with
enforcing its statutory mandate.

															In sum, with Section 114(r)(1), Congress has required agency
action that would preclude the release of information
â€œdetrimental to the security of
transportation.â€ In so doing, Congress has expressed
its clear intent to pro-hibit such disclosures. I would respect its
intent, and hold that a disclosure contravening that mandate is
â€œprohibited by lawâ€ within the
meaning of the WPA.

															Having said all that, I appreciate the narrowness of the
Courtâ€™s holding. The Courtâ€™s
conclusion that Section 114(r) does not itself prohibit any
disclosures depends entirely on the statutory language directing
the agency to â€œprescribe
regulations,â€ and providing that the agency will
â€œdecid[e]â€ what information falls
within the statueâ€™s purview. See ante, at
11. From all that appears in the majority opinion, then, this case
would likely have turned out differently if Section 114(r) instead
provided: â€œThe disclosure of information
detrimental to the security of transportation is prohibited, and
the TSA shall promulgate regulations to that effect,â€
or â€œThe Under Secretary shall prescribe
regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information detrimental
to the security of transportation; and such disclosures are
prohibited.â€ I myself decline to surrender so fully to
sheer formalism, especially where transportation security is at
issue and there is little dispute that the disclosure of air
marshalsâ€™ locations is potentially dangerous and
was proscribed by the relevant implementing regulation. In so
surrendering, however, the Court would appear to have enabled
future courts and Con-gresses to avoid easily the consequences of
its ruling, and thus to have limited much of the potential for
adverse practical effects beyond this case. But in the interim, at
least, the Court has left important decisions regarding the
disclosure of critical information completely to the whims of
individual employees.

															I respectfully dissent.

Notes
1Â The Court does not address
respondentâ€™s alternative argument, accepted by
the Court of Appeals below, that Section 114(r)(1) describes the
information encompassed in its prohibitory scope with insufficient
particularity to qualify the disclosure here as
â€œspecifically prohibited by
lawâ€ within the meaning of the WPA. Some of the
legislative history of the WPA linked its specificity requirement
to the criteria established in Exemption 3 of the Freedom of
Information Act,5 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§552(b)(3), and the Court of Appeals applied this
standard. See 714 F. 3d 1301, 1309 (CA Fed. 2013); see also S. Rep.
No. 95â€“969, pp. 21â€“22 (1978).
MacLean has offered no argument that a WPA anti-disclosure statute
must define the relevant category of information with any greater
degree of particularity. Assuming the Exemption 3 standard is
applicable, I note that Section 114(r) is at least as
â€œspecificâ€ as the statutory
provisions we have previously held to satisfy Exemption
3â€™s requirements. See, e.g.,
Department of Justice v. Julian,486 U.Â S.
1,9 (1988) (holding that provisions of Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 32(c)(3)(A) and former18 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§4208(c)(1982 ed.) prohibiting disclosure of portions
of presentence reports â€œrelat[ed] to
confidential sources, diagnostic opinions, and other information
that may cause harm to the defendant or to third
partiesâ€ could justify withholding under Exemption
3 (emphasis added)).
2Â For the same reasons, the
agencyâ€™s decision that a disclosure contravened
a statute may not necessarily be determinative in any given WPA
case: Although an agency may no doubt receive deference in the
interpretation and implementation of a prohibitory statute,
ultimately WPA protection will not apply if the agency improperly
concluded that a given disclosure was prohibited by that statute.
Cf. CIA v. Sims,471 U.Â S.
159â€“181 (1985) (according deference to Central
Intelligence Agencyâ€™s expertise, but engaging in
an extended analysis of whether the particular information the
agency refused to disclose fell within the scope of the statutory
prohibition).
