															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[June 26, 2019]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring in the judgment.

															I agree with Justice Gorsuch’s conclusion that the Auer deference doctrine should be formally retired.  I write separately to emphasize two points.

															First, I agree with The Chief Justice that “the distance between the majority and Justice Gorsuch is not as great as it may initially appear.”  Ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part).  The majority’s approach in Part II−B of its opinion closely resembles the argument advanced by the Solicitor General to “clarif[y] and narro[w]” Auer.  Brief for Respondent 15.  Importantly, the majority borrows from footnote 9 of this Court’s opinion in Chevron to say that a reviewing court must “exhaust all the ‘traditional tools’ of construction” before concluding that an agency rule is ambiguous and deferring to an agency’s reasonable interpretation.  Ante, at 14 (quoting Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U.S. 837, 843, n. 9 (1984)).  If a reviewing court employs all of the traditional tools of construction, the court will almost always reach a conclusion about the best interpretation of the regulation at issue.  After doing so, the court then will have no need to adopt or defer to an agency’s contrary interpretation.  In other words, the footnote 9 principle, taken seriously, means that courts will have no reason or basis to put a thumb on the scale in favor of an agency when courts interpret agency regulations.

															Formally rejecting Auer would have been a more direct approach, but rigorously applying footnote 9 should lead in most cases to the same general destination.  Umpires in games at Wrigley Field do not defer to the Cubs manager’s in-game interpretation of Wrigley’s ground rules.  So too here.

															To be sure, some cases involve regulations that employ broad and open-ended terms like “reasonable,” “appropriate,” “feasible,” or “practicable.”  Those kinds of terms afford agencies broad policy discretion, and courts allow an agency to reasonably exercise its discretion to choose among the options allowed by the text of the rule.  But that is more State Farm than Auer.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.,

463 U.S. 29 (1983).

															In short, after today’s decision, a judge should engage in appropriately rigorous scrutiny of an agency’s interpretation of a regulation, and can simultaneously be appropriately deferential to an agency’s reasonable policy choices within the discretion allowed by a regulation.

															Second, I also agree with The Chief Justice that “[i]ssues surrounding judicial deference to agency interpretations of their own regulations are distinct from those raised in connection with judicial deference to agency interpretations of statutes enacted by Congress.”  Ante, at 2.  Like The Chief Justice, “I do not regard the Court’s decision” not to formally overrule Auer “to touch upon the latter question.”  Ibid.
