															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 13â€“975

															T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC, PETITIONER v.CITY OF ROSWELL,
GEORGIA

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the eleventh circuit

															[January 14, 2015]

															Justice Thomas, dissenting.

															I join Part I of The Chief Justiceâ€™s
dissent, which says all the Court needed to say to resolve this
case. I write separately to express my concern about the
Courtâ€™s eagerness to reach beyond the bounds of
the present dispute to create a timing requirement that finds no
support in the text or structure of the statute. We have been
unwilling to impose procedural requirements on federal agencies in
the absence of statutory command, even while recognizing that an
agencyâ€™s failure to make its decisions known at
the time it acts may burden regulated parties. See, e.g.,
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp.,496
U.Â S. 633â€“655 (1990). When a State
vests its municipalities with authority to exercise a core state
power, those municipalities deserve at least as much respect as a
fed-eral agency. But today, the majority treats them as less than
conscripts in â€œthe national bureaucratic
army,â€ FERC v. Mississippi,456
U.Â S. 742,775 (1982) (Oâ€™Connor, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part). I respectfully
dissent.
