Supreme Court of the United States

2 U.S. 401

VANSTOPHORST ET AL.  v.  THE STATE OF MARYLAND

 Argued: . . . --- Decided: August 3, 1791

THE Attorney General (Randolph) moved, on behalf of the plaintiffs, that a commission should issue to examine witnesses in Holland; to which the opposite counsel assented, although the commissioners were not named.

But, by the Court:—We will not award the commission, ’till commissioners are named.

This being done, the motion was granted.
