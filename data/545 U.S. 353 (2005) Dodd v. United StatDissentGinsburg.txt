GINSBURG, J., DISSENTING
DODD V. UNITED STATES
545 U. S. ____ (2005)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 04-5286

															MICHAEL DONALD DODD, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the eleventh circuit

															[June 20, 2005]

															   Justice Ginsburg, with whom
Justice Breyer joins, dissenting.

															   Essentially for reasons stated by
Justice Stevens, I conclude that 28 U. S. C. §2255,
¶6(3), is most sensibly read to start the time clock on the
date a right is “made retroactively applicable to cases on
collateral review.” I therefore join, in principal part, Part
II of Justice Stevens’ dissenting opinion.*

															   The Court’s interpretation—that
the limitation period begins on “the date on which the right
asserted was initially recognized by [this] Court,” 28 U.
S. C. §2255, ¶6(3)—presents “a real risk
that the 1-year limitation period will expire before [a §2255
petitioner’s] cause of action accrues,” ante,
at 5 (Stevens, J., dissenting). By contrast, as Justice Breyer
explains in his dissenting opinion in Graham County Soil &
Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel.
Wilson, post, at 5–6, a determination that the
False Claims Act’s six-year statute of limitations, see 31 U.
S. C. §3731(b)(1), governs civil suits for retaliation
under the Act, see §3730(h), ordinarily would work no claim
deprivation. See ante, at 7–8 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting) (In Graham County, “the possibility that
the 6-year statute of limitations period could run before the cause
of action accrued, while plausible, was not particularly likely,
since in most cases the retaliatory conduct that would form the
basis of the cause of action under 31 U. S. C. §3730(h)
would probably occur within six years of the violation of
§3729. [In cases like Dodd, on the other hand,] owing
to the substantially shorter 1-year statute of limitation period,
both requirements of 28 U. S. C. §2255, ¶6(3), will
often not be met before the statute of limitation period has
expired if it is triggered by the decision of the Supreme Court
announcing a new rule.” (footnote omitted)).

															   Nearly 20 years have passed since Congress
amended 31 U. S. C. §3731(b)(1) to provide that
“[a] civil action under section 3730 may not be brought
… more than 6 years after the date on which the violation of
section 3729 is committed.” See Graham County,
post, at 2. Yet petitioner Graham County District has been
unable to cite a single instance in which a suit has been time
barred because the alleged retaliation proscribed by §3730(h)
fell outside the period triggered by submission of a false claim in
violation of §3729. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 04–169,
pp. 4–6; Brief for Respondent in No. 04–169, pp. 4,
15–16; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in
No. 04–169, pp. 27–28; see also Graham County,
post, at 5 (Breyer, J., dissenting). As Dodd’s case
illustrates, however, on the Court’s reading, it is
“highly probable” that the 28 U. S. C. §2255,
¶6(3), limitation “would bar relief before the claim can
be brought.” Ante, at 9 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
Accordingly, I would not, as Justice Stevens does, bracket the
instant case with Graham County.

															   True, the limitation period in Graham
County, like the §2255, ¶6(3), limitation, is
triggered by an event that may precede the accrual date of a claim.
But the resemblance ends there. The generous six-year span in 31 U.
S. C. §3731(b)(1), in practical effect, will give the
plaintiff leeway to commence suit she likely will not have under
the typically shorter state limitation. See Graham County,
post, at 5 (Breyer, J., dissenting). The opposite effect
would attend 28 U. S. C. §2255, ¶6(3). The one-year
limitation specified there, if triggered by the date on which this
Court “initially recognized” the right asserted, bars
Dodd and will bar most “new rule” petitioners from
presenting their claims. It exalts form over reality to equate the
two statutes and cases for time-bar purposes.

															* Petitioner and respondent assume, for the
purpose at hand, that a controlling decision whether a right
operates retroactively may be made by a court of appeals. See Tr.
of Oral Arg. 5–7, 20, 24, 41; Brief for Petitioner
13–14, and n. 2, 25, and n. 5, 26–28; Brief
for United States 17–18, and n. 5, 23. We have no cause
in this case to question that assumption. I therefore do not
subscribe to Justice Stevens’ statements that only this Court
has the prerogative to make the retroactivity determination. See
ante, at 6–7, n. 4. I would await full
adversarial presentation before expressing an opinion on that
issue.
