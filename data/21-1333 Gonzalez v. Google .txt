															Reynaldo Gonzalez, et al., PETITIONERS
v. Google LLC

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 18, 2023]

															

															Per Curiam.

															In 2015, ISIS terrorists unleashed a set of
coordinated attacks across Paris, France, killing 130 victims,
including Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old U. S.
citizen.[1] Gonzalez’s
parents and brothers then sued Google, LLC, under 18
U. S. C. §§2333(a) and (d)(2), alleging that
Google was both directly and secondarily liable for the terrorist
attack that killed Gonzalez.[2]
For their secondary-liability claims, plaintiffs alleged that
Google aided and abetted and conspired with ISIS. All of their
claims broadly center on the use of YouTube, which Google owns and
operates, by ISIS and ISIS supporters.

															The District Court dismissed plaintiffs’
complaint for failure to state a claim, though it offered
plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint. Instead, plaintiffs
stood on their complaint and appealed, and the Ninth Circuit
affirmed in a consolidated opinion that also addressed
Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, ___ U. S. ___
(2023). 2 F. 4th 871 (2021). With respect to this case, the
Ninth Circuit held that most of the plaintiffs’ claims were
barred by §230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996,
110Stat. 137, 47 U. S. C. §230(c)(1). The sole
exceptions were plaintiffs’ direct- and secondary-liability
claims based on allegations that Google approved ISIS videos for
advertisements and then shared proceeds with ISIS through
YouTube’s revenue-sharing system. The Ninth Circuit held that
these potential claims were not barred by §230, but that
plaintiffs’ allegations failed to state a viable claim in any
event.

															We granted certiorari to review the Ninth
Circuit’s application of §230. See 598 U. S. ___
(2022). Plaintiffs did not seek review of the Ninth Circuit’s
holdings regarding their revenue-sharing claims. In light of those
unchallenged holdings and our disposition of Twitter, on
which we also granted certiorari and in which we today reverse the
Ninth Circuit’s judgment, it has become clear that
plaintiffs’ complaint—independent of
§230—states little if any claim for relief. As
plaintiffs concede, the allegations underlying their
secondary-liability claims are materially identical to those at
issue in Twitter. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58. Since we hold
that the complaint in that case fails to state a claim for aiding
and abetting under §2333(d)(2), it appears to follow that the
complaint here likewise fails to state such a claim. And, in
discussing plaintiffs’ revenue-sharing claims, the Ninth
Circuit held that plaintiffs plausibly alleged neither that
“Google reached an agreement with ISIS,” as required
for conspiracy liability, nor that Google’s acts were
“intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, or
to influence or affect a government,” as required for a
direct-liability claim under §2333(a). 2 F. 4th, at 901,
907. Perhaps for that reason, at oral argument, plaintiffs only
suggested that they should receive leave to amend their complaint
if we were to reverse and remand in Twitter. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 58, 163.

															We need not resolve either the viability of
plaintiffs’ claims as a whole or whether plaintiffs should
receive further leave to amend. Rather, we think it sufficient to
acknowledge that much (if not all) of plaintiffs’ complaint
seems to fail under either our decision in Twitter or the
Ninth Circuit’s unchallenged holdings below. We therefore
decline to address the application of §230 to a complaint that
appears to state little, if any, plausible claim for relief.
Instead, we vacate the judgment below and remand the case for the
Ninth Circuit to consider plaintiffs’ complaint in light of
our decision in Twitter.

															

															It is so ordered.

which such act of international terrorism was committed, planned,
or authorized, liability may be asserted as to any person who aids
and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who
conspires with the person who committed such an act of
international terrorism.”
