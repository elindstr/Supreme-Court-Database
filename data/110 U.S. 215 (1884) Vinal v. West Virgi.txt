Vinal v. West Virginia Oil and Oil Land Company
Submitted January 10, 1884
Decided January 21, 1884
110 U.S. 215

IN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED

															STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.

															This judgment is affirmed.  One partner cannot recover his share of a debt due to the partnership in an action at law, prosecuted in his own name alone, against the debtor.  That is the only question presented by the bill of exceptions in this case.  The refusal of the court below to grant a new trial is not reviewable here.

															Affirmed.
