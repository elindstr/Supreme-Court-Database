															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ANTHONY
DAVILA

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

															[June 13, 2013]

															

															Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas
joins, con-curring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I agree with the Court that a defendant must be
prej-udiced by a Rule 11(c)(1) error to obtain relief. That is
because the text of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(h) says
exactly that, in words whose meaning is crystal clear:
“Harmless error. A variance from the requirements of this
rule is harmless error if it does not affect sub-stantial
rights.” (Emphasis added.) As the Court recognizes, this rule
“calls for across-the-board application of the harmless-error
prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error
rule).” Ante, at 12. That is the beginning and the end
of this case. We should not rely on the notes of the Advisory
Committee to unearth Rule 11’s alleged design, for
“[t]he Committee’s view is not authoritative” and
the text of the Rule conclusively resolves the question before us.
See Black v. United States, 561 U. S. ___, ___
(2010) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)
(slip op., at 1).
