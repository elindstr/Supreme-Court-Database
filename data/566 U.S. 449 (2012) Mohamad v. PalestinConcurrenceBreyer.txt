															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 11–88

															ASID MOHAMAD, individually and for the ESTATE
OF AZZAM RAHIM, deceased, et al., PETITIONERS v.
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

															[April 18, 2012]

															

															Justice Breyer, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion with one
qualification. The word “individual” is open to
multiple interpretations, permitting it, linguistically speaking,
to include natural persons, corporations, and other entities. Thus,
I do not believe that word alone is sufficient to decide this
case.

															The legislative history of the statute, however,
makes up for whatever interpretive inadequacies remain after con-
sidering language alone. See, e.g., ante, at 9 (describ- ing
markup session in which one of the bill’s sponsors proposed
an amendment containing the word “individual” to
“make it clear” that the statute applied to
“individuals and not to corporations”); Hearing on S.
1629 et al. be- fore the Subcommittee on Immigration and
Refugee Affairs of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 101st
Cong., 2d Sess., 65 (1990) (witness explaining to committee that
there would be a “problem” with suing an
“independent en- tity or a series of entities that are not
governments,” such as the Palestinian Liberation
Organization); id., at 75 (allaying concerns that there will
be a flood of lawsuits “because of the requirement [in the
statute] that an individual has to identify his or her precise
torture[r] and they have to be both in the United States”);
see also ante, at 8–9 (making clear that
petitioners’ citations to the legislative history “do
not help their cause”). After examining the history in
detail, and considering it along with the reasons that the Court
provides, I join the Court’s judgment and opinion.
