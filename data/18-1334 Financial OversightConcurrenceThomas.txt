															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit

															[June 1, 2020]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

															

															The Court reaches the right conclusion: The appointment process for members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (Board) does not violate the Appointments Clause.  I cannot agree, however, with the ill-defined path that the Court takes to reach this result.  I would resolve these cases based on the original public meaning of the phrase “Officers of the United States” in the Appointments Clause.

															I

															The Appointments Clause provides that the President “shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law.”  Art. II, §2, cl. 2.  The Clause also permits Congress to vest the appointment of “inferior Officers” in “the President alone,” “the Courts of Law,” or “the Heads of Departments.”  Ibid.

															As I have previously explained, the original public meaning of the phrase “Officers of the United States” includes “all federal civil officials who perform an ongoing, statutory duty.”  Lucia v. SEC, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2) (citing Mascott, Who Are “Officers of the United States”? 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443, 454 (2018) (Mascott)).  At the founding, the term “officer” referred to “anyone who performed a continuous public duty.”  585 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  And the phrase “of the United States” limited the Appointments Clause to “federal” officers.  Ibid.; see Mascott 471–479.

															II

															Territorial officials performing duties created under Article IV of the Constitution are not federal officers within the original meaning of the phrase “Officers of the United States.”  Since the founding, this Court has recognized a distinction between Article IV power and the powers of the National Government in Articles I, II, and III.  The founding generation understood the phrase “Officers of the United States” to refer to officers exercising the powers of the National Government, not officers solely exercising Article IV territorial power.  Because the Board’s members perform duties pursuant to Article IV, they do not qualify as “Officers of the United States.”

															A

															The Territory Clause of Article IV provides Congress the “Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory . . . belonging to the United States.”  §3, cl. 2.  This power is “absolute and undisputed.”  Sere v. Pitot, 6 Cranch 332, 337 (1810).  Congress has “full and complete legislative authority over the people of the Territories and all the departments of the territorial governments.”  National Bank v. County of Yankton,

101 U.S. 129, 133 (1880).

															“No one has ever doubted the authority of congress to erect territorial governments within the territory of the United States, under the general language of the clause, ‘to make all needful rules and regulations.’ ”  3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §1319, p. 195 (1833).  These governments are “the creations, exclusively, of [Congress], and subject to its supervision and control.”  Benner v. Porter, 9 How. 235, 242 (1850).[1]

															Because territorial governments “are not organized under the Constitution,” they are not “subject to its complex distribution of the powers of government.”  Ibid.  Congress may give Territories “a legislative, an executive, and a judiciary, with such powers as it has been their will to assign.”  Sere, 6 Cranch, at 337.  And, since the founding, Congress has done so in ways that do not comport with the Constitution’s restrictions on the National Government.  For example, Congress has delegated Article IV legislative authority to territorial officials and legislatures,[2] which it could not do with Article I legislative power.  See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,

531 U.S. 457, 472 (2001); Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads,

575 U.S. 43, 67–88 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  It has also established territorial courts that do not comply with Article III.  See Baude, Adjudication Outside Article III, 133 Harv. L. Rev. 1511, 1525–1530 (2020) (analyzing territorial courts in early Territories).

															The powers vested in territorial governments are distinct from the powers of the National Government.  Territorial legislatures exercise the legislative power of the Territory, not Article I legislative power.  Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States,

301 U.S. 308, 322–323 (1937).  Territorial officials exercise the executive power of the Territory, not Article II executive power.  Snow v. United States, 18 Wall. 317, 321–322 (1873).  And territorial courts exercise the judicial power of the Territory, not the “judicial power of the United States” under Article III.  American Ins. Co. v. 356 Bales of Cotton, 1 Pet. 511, 546 (1828); Clinton v. En-glebrecht, 13 Wall. 434, 447 (1872).

															B

															Given the distinction between territorial and national powers, the question becomes whether officers exercising Article IV territorial power are officers “of the United States” under the original meaning of the Appointments Clause.  They are not.  Both the text of the Appointments Clause and historical practice support this conclusion.

															1

															The text of the Appointments Clause indicates that “Officers of the United States” refers to officers exercising the powers of the National Government, not officers exercising territorial power.  The Clause applies to the appointment of 

															 

															“Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States.”  Art. II, §2, cl. 2.  Each of the officers specifically mentioned in the Clause—“Ambassadors,” “public Ministers,” “Consuls,” and “Judges of the supreme Court”—holds an office that exercises national power.  Ibid.  Although not dispositive, this fact suggests that the phrase “and all other Officers of the United States” refers to “other” officers of the National Government.  See Beecham v. United States,

511 U.S. 368, 371 (1994) (“That several items in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as well”); see also A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 195–198 (2012) (discussing the “associated-words canon,” also known as noscitur a sociis).

															2

															Historical evidence from the founding era confirms that officers exercising Article IV territorial power are not “Officers of the United States.”  The Court acknowledges some of this evidence and surveys the history of appointments in Puerto Rico.  Ante, at 8–14.  I, however, would give more weight and focus to the practices of the First Congress, which provide “powerful evidence of the original understanding of the Constitution.”  Comptroller of Treasury of Md. v. Wynne,

575 U.S. 542, 580 (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (compiling cases relying on the practices of the First Congress to interpret the Constitution).

															Before the Constitution’s ratification, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 set up a territorial government for the Northwest Territory.  Act of Aug. 7, 1789,

1Stat.
51, n. (a) (reproducing the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 enacted by the Continental Congress).  This ordinance granted Congress the power to appoint the Northwest Territory’s Governor, secretary, judges, and general militia officers.  Ibid.  And it provided the Governor the power to appoint “magistrates and other civil officers” of the Territory.  Ibid.

															In 1789, after the ratification of the Constitution, the First Congress amended the Northwest Ordinance “to adapt [it] to the present Constitution of the United States.”  Id., at 51.  One of these amendments provided that “the President shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint all officers which by the said ordinance were to have been appointed by the United States in Congress assembled, and all officers so appointed shall be commissioned by him.”  Id., at 53.  The officers not previously designated for congressional appointment, including “magistrates and other civil officers,” remained subject to appointment by the Governor.  Id., at 51, n. (a), and 53.  These amendments (and lack thereof ) provide strong evidence that the First Congress understood the distinction between territorial officers and officers of the National Government.

															As the Court recognizes, Congress revised the Northwest Ordinance to require “a Presidential-appointment, Senate-confirmation process for high-level territorial appointees who assumed federal, as well as local, duties.”  Ante, at 8 (emphasis added).  For example, Congress revised the appointment process for the Governor of the Northwest Territory, who performed duties under the powers of the National Government in addition to his Article IV territorial duties.  The Governor “discharg[ed] the duties of superintendent of Indian affairs,” Act of Sept. 11, 1789, ch. 13, §1,

1Stat.
68, which required him to execute congressional regulations, manage trade with Indians, and obey instructions received from the Secretary of War with respect to his duties as superintendent.  See Ordinance for the Regulation of Indian Affairs (Aug. 7, 1786); see also F. Prucha, American Indian Policy in the Formative Years: The Indian Trade and Intercourse Acts 1790–1834, p. 36 (1962).  The Governor negotiated treaties with Indians on behalf of the United States.  See 2 The Papers of George Washington: Presidential Series 196–198 (D. Twohig ed. 1987); 33 Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789, p. 711 (R. Hill ed. 1936).  He even had the power to call on the militia of the States in the President’s name to prevent “incursions of the hostile Indians.”  2 The St. Clair Papers 125 (W. Smith ed. 1882).  Thus, at least with respect to the Governor, who wielded powers of the National Government, the First Congress appears to have modified the Northwest Ordinance to ensure its compliance with the Appointments Clause.

															In contrast, Congress did not revise the process for appointing “magistrates and other civil officers,” who remained subject to appointment by the Governor.

1Stat.
51, n. (a), and 53.  The “magistrates and other civil officers” of the Northwest Territory included justices of the peace, clerks of the court, sheriffs, coroners, surveyors, and notaries.  3 The Territorial Papers of the United States: The Territory Northwest of the River Ohio, 1787–1803, pp. 304–307 (C. Carter ed. 1934).  If these officials were exercising a statutory duty under the powers of the National Government, they would have certainly been considered “Officers of the United States” under the Appointments Clause.  See Mascott 484–507, 510–515.  “The Founders considered individuals to be officers even if they performed only ministerial statutory duties—including recordkeepers, clerks, and tidewaiters (individuals who watched goods land at a customhouse).”  Lucia, 585 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3).  But “the powers and duties of magistrates and other civil officers [were] regulated and defined by the [territorial] assembly,”

1Stat.
51, n. (a), and therefore were necessarily exercised pursuant to Article IV, see supra, at 3–5.  It is evident that the First Congress did not consider these officials to be “Officers of the United States,” because it allowed appointment by an official who is not the “hea[d] of a department.”  See United States v. Germaine,

99 U.S. 508, 510 (1879).

															One cannot plausibly conclude that the First Congress—seeking to “adapt” the Northwest Ordinance to the Constitution,

1Stat.
51—prescribed methods of appointing territorial officers that violated the Appointments Clause.  Rather, the First Congress recognized the distinction between territorial and national powers, see supra, at 6–8, and understood that officers performing duties pursuant to only Article IV territorial powers are not officers “of the United States.”  For these reasons, I would hold that the original meaning of the phrase “Officers of the United States” does not include territorial officers exercising only powers conferred under Article IV.

															C

															Under the original meaning of the Appointments Clause, the Board’s members are not “Officers of the United States.”  They are territorial officers exercising power granted under Article IV.

															The Board is “an entity within the territorial government,”

48 U. S. C. §2121(c)(1), created “pursuant to article IV, section 3 of the Constitution of the United States,” §2121(b)(2), and funded by the Territory, §2127(b).  The members of the Board perform duties involving the oversight of Puerto Rico’s finances and fiscal reform efforts, §§2141–2152, and the representation of Puerto Rico in debt restructuring proceedings, §§2161–2177.  Because “they do not exercise the national executive power,” “national judicial power,” or national legislative power, the Board’s members are “Article IV executives,” not Officers of the United States under the Appointments Clause.  See Freytag v. Commissioner,

501 U.S. 868, 913 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted).

															The Court rightfully acknowledges the territorial nature of the Board’s duties.  Ante, at 14–20.  But in the process, the Court sets up a dichotomy between officers with “primarily local versus primarily federal” duties.  Ante, at 18 (emphasis deleted).  I cannot agree with this amorphous test.

															As an initial matter, the Court need not decide whether an officer exercising both national and Article IV powers qualifies as an “Officer of the United States.”  The Board’s members have responsibility for ongoing statutory duties that are entirely within the scope of Article IV.  See ante, at 14–20.

															Resolving this unnecessary issue is especially problematic because the original meaning of the phrase “Officers of the United States” arguably includes all officers exercising the powers of the National Government, even if those officers also exercise power vested under Article IV.  The Governor of the Northwest Territory, for example, seems to have performed “primarily local” duties, yet the First Congress believed the Governor was an “Officer of the United States” subject to the restrictions of the Appointments Clause.  Supra, at 7–8; see also ante, at 8.

															The Court fails to engage with this point.  Indeed, it fails to provide any foundation at all for its “primarily local” rule.  The only analysis to be found is a conclusory statement that Palmore v. United States,

411 U.S. 389 (1973), “provides a rough analogy.”  Ante, at 19.  But drawing a rule from a case that is “no[t] . . . directly on point,” ibid., without even analyzing the underlying reasoning of that case, is not sound constitutional interpretation.  And favoring a tangentially related decision from 1973 over the practices of the First Congress is certainly not “more faithful to the [Appointment] Clause’s original meaning,” ante, at 21.

															Finally, the Court fails to provide any explanation for what makes an officer’s duties “primarily local.”  Ante, at 14–20.  Is it the relative importance of the duties?  Or is it the number of duties exercised pursuant to each power?  And what ratio is required for duties to be primarily local?  The Court’s opinion has no answers and does not even acknowledge the questions.  And, regardless of how these questions are resolved, the primarily local test allows Congress to evade the requirements of the Appointments Clause by supplementing an officer’s federal duties with sufficient territorial duties, such that they become “primarily local,” whatever that means.

															*  *  *

															Today’s decision reaches the right outcome, but it does so in a roundabout way that departs from the original meaning of the Appointments Clause.  I would hold that the Board’s members are not “Officers of the United States” because they perform ongoing statutory duties under only Article IV.  I therefore cannot join the Court’s opinion and concur only in the judgment.
Notes
1
 The Court of Appeals attempted to draw a distinction between power exercised pursuant to territorial laws enacted by Congress and power exercised pursuant to territorial laws enacted by a territorial legislature.  There is no meaningful distinction in this context.  While the legislature of the Territory may establish laws for the Territories, Article IV remains the “ultimate source” of territorial power.  Puerto Rico v. Sánchez Valle, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 15) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Congress is the source of the “entire dominion and sovereignty” of a Territory, Simms v. Simms,

175 U.S. 162, 168 (1899), and therefore all territorial laws, whether congressionally enacted or territorially enacted, derive from Article IV, Sánchez Valle, 579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (recognizing that the “most immediate source of [the] authority” does not change the nature of the power exercised).
