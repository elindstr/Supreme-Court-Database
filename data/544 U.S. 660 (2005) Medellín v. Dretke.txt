PER CURIAM
MEDELLIN V. DRETKE
544 U. S. ____ (2005)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															JOSE ERNESTO MEDELLIN, PETITIONER v. DOUG
DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,
CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the fifth circuit

															[May 23, 2005]

															   Per Curiam.

															   We granted certiorari in this
case to consider two questions: first, whether a federal court is
bound by the International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) ruling
that United States courts must reconsider petitioner José
Medellín’s claim for relief under the Vienna
Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, [1970] 21 U.
S. T. 77, 100–101, T. I. A. S.
No. 6820, without regard to procedural default doctrines; and
second, whether a federal court should give effect, as a matter of
judicial comity and uniform treaty interpretation, to the
ICJ’s judgment. 543 U. S. ___ (2004). After we granted
certiorari, Medellín filed an application for a writ of
habeas corpus in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, relying in
part upon a memorandum from President George W. Bush that was
issued after we granted certiorari. This state-court proceeding may
provide Medellín with the very reconsideration of his Vienna
Convention claim that he now seeks in the present proceeding. The
merits briefing in this case also has revealed a number of hurdles
Medellín must surmount before qualifying for federal habeas
relief in this proceeding, based on the resolution of the questions
he has presented here. For these reasons we dismiss the writ as
improvidently granted. See Ticor Title Ins. Co. v.
Brown, 511
U. S. 117, 121–122 (1994) (per curiam); The
Monrosa v. Carbon Black Export, Inc., 359 U. S. 180,
183–184 (1959); Goins v. United States,
306 U. S. 622
(1939).

															   Medellín, a Mexican national, confessed
to participating in the gang rape and murder of two girls in 1993.
He was convicted and sentenced to death, and the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals affirmed on direct appeal. Medellín then
filed a state habeas corpus action, claiming for the first time
that Texas failed to notify him of his right to consular access as
required by the Vienna Convention. The state trial court rejected
this claim, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals summarily
affirmed.

															   Medellín then filed this federal habeas
corpus petition, again raising the Vienna Convention claim. The
District Court denied the petition. Subsequently, while
Medellín’s application to the Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit for a certificate of appealability was pending, see
28 U. S. C. §2253(c), the ICJ issued its decision in
Case Concerning Avena and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v.
U. S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar.
31), in which the Republic of Mexico had alleged violations of the
Vienna Convention with respect to Medellín and other Mexican
nationals facing the death penalty in the United States. The ICJ
determined that the Vienna Convention guaranteed individually
enforceable rights, that the United States had violated those
rights, and that the United States must “provide, by means of
its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and
sentences of the [affected] Mexican nationals” to determine
whether the violations “caused actual prejudice,”
without allowing procedural default rules to bar such review.
Id., ¶¶ 121–122, 153.

															   The Court of Appeals denied
Medellín’s application for a certificate of
appealability. It did so based on Medellín’s
procedural default, see Breard v. Greene,
523 U. S. 371, 375 (1998) (per
curiam), and its prior holdings that the Vienna Convention did
not create an individually enforceable right, see, e.g.,
United States v. Jimenez-Nava, 243 F. 3d
192, 195 (CA5 2001). 371 F. 3d 270 (CA5 2004). While
acknowledging the existence of the ICJ’s Avena
judgment, the court gave no dispositive effect to that
judgment.

															   More than two months after we granted
certiorari, and a month before oral argument in this case,
President Bush issued a memorandum that stated the United States
would discharge its international obligations under the
Avena judgment by “having State courts give effect
to the [ICJ] decision in accordance with general principles of
comity in cases filed by the 51 Mexican nationals addressed in that
decision.” George W. Bush, Memorandum for the Attorney
General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 9a. Relying on this memorandum and the
Avena judgment as separate bases for relief that were not
available at the time of his first state habeas corpus action,
Medellín filed a successive state application for a writ of
habeas corpus just four days before oral argument here. That state
proceeding may provide Medellín with the review and
reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim that the ICJ
required, and that Medellín now seeks in this proceeding.
This new development, as well as the factors discussed below, leads
us to dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently
granted.[Footnote 1]

															   There are several threshold issues that could
independently preclude federal habeas relief for Medellín,
and thus render advisory or academic our consideration of the
questions presented. These issues are not free from doubt.

															   First, even accepting, arguendo, the
ICJ’s construction of the Vienna Convention’s consular
access provisions, a violation of those provisions may not be
cognizable in a federal habeas proceeding. In Reed v.
Farley, 512
U. S. 339 (1994), this Court recognized that a violation of
federal statutory rights ranked among the “nonconstitutional
lapses we have held not cognizable in a postconviction
proceeding” unless they meet the “fundamental
defect” test announced in our decision in Hill v.
United States, 368 U. S. 424, 428
(1962). 512 U. S., at 349 (plurality opinion); see also
id., at 355–356 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). In order for Medellín to obtain
federal habeas relief, Medellín must therefore establish
that Reed does not bar his treaty claim.

															   Second, with respect to any claim the state
court “adjudicated on the merits,” habeas relief in
federal court is available only if such adjudication “was
contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established
Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.” 28 U.
S. C. §2254(d)(1); see Woodford v.
Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 22–27
(2002) (per curiam). The state habeas court, which
disposed of the case before the ICJ rendered its judgment in
Avena, arguably “adjudicated on the merits”
three claims. It found that the Vienna Convention did not create
individual, judicially enforceable rights and that state procedural
default rules barred Medellín’s consular access claim.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the state trial court found
that Medellín “fail[ed] to show that he was harmed by
any lack of notification to the Mexican consulate concerning his
arrest for capital murder; [Medellín] was provided with
effective legal representation upon [his] request; and [his]
constitutional rights were safeguarded.” App. to Pet. for
Cert. 56a.[Footnote 2]
Medellín would have to overcome the deferential standard
with regard to all of these findings before obtaining federal
habeas relief on his Vienna Convention claim.[Footnote 3]

															   Third, a habeas corpus petitioner generally
cannot enforce a “new rule” of law. Teague v.
Lane, 489
U. S. 288 (1989). Before relief could be granted, then, we
would be obliged to decide whether or how the Avena
judgment bears on our ordinary “new rule”
jurisprudence.

															   Fourth, Medellín requires a certificate
of appealability in order to pursue the merits of his claim on
appeal. 28 U. S. C. §2253(c)(1). A certificate of
appealability may be granted only where there is “a
substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional
right.” §2253(c)(2) (emphasis added). To obtain the
necessary certificate of appealability to proceed in the Court of
Appeals, Medellín must demonstrate that his allegation of a
treaty violation could satisfy this standard. See
Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483
(2000).

															   Fifth, Medellín can seek federal habeas
relief only on claims that have been exhausted in state court. See
28 U. S. C. §§2254(b)(1)(A), (b)(3). To gain relief
based on the President’s memorandum or ICJ judgments,
Medellín would have to show that he exhausted all available
state-court remedies.[Footnote
4]

															   In light of the possibility that the Texas
courts will provide Medellín with the review he seeks
pursuant to the Avena judgment and the President’s
memorandum, and the potential for review in this Court once the
Texas courts have heard and decided Medellín’s pending
action, we think it would be unwise to reach and resolve the
multiple hindrances to dispositive answers to the questions here
presented. Accordingly, we dismiss the writ as improvidently
granted.

															It is so ordered.
Footnote 1

															 Of course Medellín, or the State of
Texas, can seek certiorari in this Court from the Texas
courts’ disposition of the state habeas corpus application.
In that instance, this Court would in all likelihood have an
opportunity to review the Texas courts’ treatment of the
President’s memorandum and Case Concerning Avena
and other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U.
S.), 2004 I. C. J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31),
unencumbered by the issues that arise from the procedural posture
of this action.
Footnote 2

															 The Federal District Court reviewing that
finding observed:

															   “Medellín’s allegations of
prejudice are speculative. The police officers informed
Medellín of his right to legal representation before he
confessed to involvement in the murders. Medellín waived his
right to advisement by an attorney. Medellín does not
challenge the voluntary nature of his confession. There is no
indication that, if informed of his consular rights,
Medellín would not have waived those rights as he did his
right to counsel. Medellín fails to establish a
‘causal connection between the [Vienna Convention] violation
and [his] statements.’ ” App. to Pet. for Cert.
84a–85a (brackets in original).
Footnote 3

															 In Breard v. Greene,
523 U. S. 371 (1998) (per
curiam), we addressed the claim that Virginia failed to notify
a Paraguayan national of his Vienna Convention right to consular
access. In denying various writs, motions, and stay applications,
we noted that the Vienna Convention “arguably confers on an
individual the right to consular assistance following
arrest”; that Virginia’s procedural default doctrine
applied to the Vienna Convention claim; and that a successful
Vienna Convention claimant likely must demonstrate prejudice.
Id., at 375–377. At the time of our Breard
decision, however, we confronted no final ICJ adjudication.
Footnote 4

															 On March 8, 2005, Medellín filed a
successive state habeas action based on Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,
Art. 11.071, §5(a)(1) (Vernon 2005), claiming that both the
President’s memorandum and the Avena judgment
independently require the Texas court to grant review and
reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim. See Subsequent
Application for Post-Conviction Writ of Habeas Corpus in Ex
Parte Medellín, Trial Cause Nos. 67,5429 and 67,5430
(Tex. Crim. App.), p. 6 (filed Mar. 24, 2005)
(“First, the President’s determination
requires this Court to comply with the Avena Judgment and
remand Mr. Medellín’s case for the mandated review and
reconsideration of his Vienna Convention claim. Second,
the Avena Judgment on its own terms provides the rule of
decision in Mr. Medellín’s case and should be given
direct effect by this Court”).
