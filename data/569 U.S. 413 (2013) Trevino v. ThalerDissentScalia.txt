															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															CARLOS TREVINO, PETITIONER v. RICK
THALER, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,
CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[May 28, 2013]

															

															Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas
joins, dissenting.

															I dissent for the reasons set forth in my
dissent in Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S.
1 (2012). That opinion sought to minimize the impact of its
novel holding as follows:

															“Our holding here addresses only the
constitutional claims presented in this case, where the State
barred the defendant from raising the claims on direct
appeal.’’ Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).

															I wrote in my dissent:

															“That line lacks any principled
basis, and will not last.’’ Id., at ___ (slip
op., at 2, n. 1).

															The Court says today:

															“Texas law on its face appears to
permit (but not require) the defendant to raise the claim on direct
appeal. Does this difference matter?’’ “[W]e can
find no significant difference between this case and
Martinez.’’ Ante, at 8, 13 (emphasis
removed).
