SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-221

															CHERYL K. PLILER, WARDEN, PETITIONER v.
RICHARD HERMAN FORD

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 21, 2004]

															   Justice O’Connor,
concurring.

															   I join the Court’s opinion
because it is limited to the narrow question whether the
notifications crafted by the Ninth Circuit must be given.

															   The propriety of the stay-and-abeyance
procedure generally is not addressed. The District Court did not
employ that procedure, nor did the Ninth Circuit hold that it must
be applied in every case. There is, therefore, no need for us to
pass on it in this case, and the Court properly avoids doing so. I
note, however, that the procedure is not an idiosyncratic one; as
Justice Breyer describes, post, at 3 (dissenting opinion),
seven of the eight Circuits to consider it have approved
stay-and-abeyance as an appropriate exercise of a district
court’s equitable powers.

															   For the reasons given by the majority,
ante, at 6–7, it is not incumbent upon a district
court to establish whether the statute of limitations has already
run before explaining the options available to a habeas petitioner
who has filed a mixed petition. Nevertheless, if the petitioner is
affirmatively misled, either by the court or by the State,
equitable tolling might well be appropriate. This is a question for
the Ninth Circuit to consider on remand. See ante, at
8.
