															MARVIN PEUGH, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 10, 2013]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Scalia joins,
dissenting.

															I agree with Justice Thomas that retroactive
application of amended advisory Guidelines does not violate the
Ex Post Facto Clause under our “sufficient risk”
test. See California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales,
514 U.S.
499, 509 (1995). I do not have occasion in this case to
reconsider that test’s merits or its relation to the original
understanding of the Clause.
