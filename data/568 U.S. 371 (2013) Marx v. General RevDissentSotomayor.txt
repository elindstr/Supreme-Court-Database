															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															OLIVEA MARX, PETITIONER v. GENERAL
REVENUE CORPORATION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the tenth circuit

															[February 26, 2013]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kagan
joins, dissenting.

															Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) is a
default standard that grants district courts discretion to award
litigation costs to a prevailing party. This default, how- ever,
gives way when a federal statute includes a costs provision that
“provides otherwise.” The Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act (FDCPA), 91Stat. 874, 15 U. S. C.
§1692 et seq., contains a costs provision,
§1692k(a)(3), and it “provides otherwise.” That is
apparent from the statute’s plain language, which limits a
court’s discretion to award costs to prevailing defendants to
cases “brought in bad faith and for the purpose of
harassment.” In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court
ignores the plain meaning of both the FDCPA and Rule 54(d)(1) and
renders the statutory language at issue in this case meaningless. I
respectfully dissent.

															I

															The majority correctly recognizes, see
ante, at 4, the fundamental principle of statutory
construction that we begin “with the language of the statute
itself.” United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises,
Inc., 489 U.S.
235, 241 (1989); Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v.
Director, Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs,
519 U.S.
248, 255 (1997); Caminetti v. United States,
242 U.S.
470, 485 (1917). We presume that Congress “means
in a statute what it says there,” Connecticut Nat.
Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S.
249, 254 (1992), and “where . . . the
statute’s language is plain, the sole function of the courts
is to enforce it according to its terms.” Ron Pair,
489 U. S., at 241 (internal quotation marks omitted). This
basic tenet is the appropriate starting point for interpreting both
Rule 54(d)(1) and §1692k(a)(3). After invoking this principle,
however, the majority casts it aside entirely in interpreting the
statute and the Rule.

															A

															Rule 54(d)(1) states, as relevant here, that
“[u]nless a federal statute . . . provides
otherwise, costs—other than attorney’s
fees—should be allowed to the prevailing party.” The
first question is what it means for a statute to “provid[e]
otherwise” than Rule 54(d)(1).

															Because the phrase “provides
otherwise” is not defined in the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, we look to its ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co.
v. Winterboer, 513 U.S.
179, 187 (1995). In common usage, to “provide
otherwise” means to “make a . . .
stipulation” that is “differen[t].”
Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1598, 1827
(2002) (Webster’s Third) (defining “provide” and
“otherwise,” respectively); see Random House Dictionary
of the English Language 1372, 1556 (2d ed. 1987) (Random House)
(“to arrange for or stipulate” “[i]n another
manner”); 10 Oxford English Dictionary 984 (2d ed. 1989)
(Oxford Dictionary); 12 id., at 713 (“to
stipulate” “[i]n another way . . . ; in a
different manner”). This reading of the plain text is
confirmed by the original 1937 codification of the Rule, which made
clear that any “express provision” relating to costs in
a statute is sufficient to displace the default.[1]

															Accordingly, to displace Rule 54(d)(1), a
federal statute need only address costs in a way different from,
but not necessarily inconsistent with, the default.[2] The reason is straightforward. If Congress
has enacted a provision with respect to costs in a statute, there
is no longer any need for the default, so it gives way. This design
of the Rule is sensible, because many statutes contain specific
costs provisions. 10 Moore’s Federal Practice
§54.101[1][c], p. 54–160 (3d ed. 2012) (noting that such
statutes “are far too numerous to list
comprehensively”). Rule 54(d)(1) is therefore consistent with
the canon of statutory interpretation that “a precisely
drawn, detailed statute pre-empts more general remedies.”
Hinck v. United States, 550 U.S.
501, 506 (2007); Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T.
Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S.
437, 445 (1987); United States v. Erika, Inc.,
456 U.S.
201, 208 (1982).

															While purporting to interpret the
“ordinary meaning” of Rule 54(d)(1), ante, at 4,
the majority immediately abandons the ordinary meaning. The
majority concludes that a statute provides otherwise for purposes
of Rule 54(d)(1) only if it is “contrary” to the
default. Ante, at 5. But the majority does not cite even a
single dictionary definition in support of that reading, despite
the oft-cited principle that a definition widely reflected in
dictionaries generally governs over other possible
meanings.[3] Lacking any
dictionary support for its interpretation, the majority relies
instead upon a treatise published nearly 60 years after the
Rule’s adoption. See ante, 6–7 (citing 6 J.
Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice, p. 54–304 (2d ed.
1996)).

															“Otherwise” means
“different.” Webster’s Third 1518; see
supra, at 2–3. The majority’s preferred term of
art, “contrary,” sets a higher bar; it signifies
“the opposite,” or “a proposition, fact, or
condition incompatible with an- other.”
Webster’s Third 495 (emphasis added). See also American
Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 399 (5th ed. 2011)
(“Opposed, as in character or purpose”); 3 Oxford
Dictionary 844 (“Opposed in nature or tendency; diametrically
different, extremely unlike”); Random House 442
(“[O]pposite in nature or character; diametrically or
mutually opposed”).

															Indeed, the majority’s reading does not
square with the everyday meaning of “otherwise.”
Consider, for example, a medication labeled with the instruction,
“take twice a day unless otherwise directed.” If a
doctor advises her patient to take the medicine “in the
morning,” the patient would understand her to mean that he
should take the medicine once a day, each morning. Although the
instruction to take the medication in the morning is not
incompatible with taking it twice a day—it could be taken in
the evening as well—an ordinary English speaker would
interpret “otherwise” to mean that the doctor’s
more specific instructions entirely supersede what is printed on
the bottle. Rule 54(d)(1) is just the same: Its default is
supplanted whenever Congress provides more specific instructions,
not only when they are diametrically opposed to it.

															B

															1

															Thus, the straightforward question in this
case is whether §1692k(a)(3) implements a
“different” standard with respect to costs than Rule
54(d)(1), and so “provides otherwise.” As relevant,
§1692k(a)(3) states: “On a finding by the court that an
action under this section was brought in bad faith and for the
purpose of harassment, the court may award to the defendant
attorney’s fees reasonable in relation to the work expended
and costs.”

															It is readily apparent that this provision is
different from the default of Rule 54(d)(1). In §1692k(a)(3),
Congress described with specificity a single circumstance in which
costs may be awarded. Far from merely restating a district
court’s discretion to award costs, this provision imposes a
prerequisite to the exercise of that discretion: a finding by the
court that an action was brought in bad faith and for the purpose
of harassment.

															Because the text is plain, there is no need to
proceed any further. Even so, relevant canons of statutory
interpretation lend added support to reading §1692k(a)(3) as
having a negative implication. That reading accords with the
expressio unius, exclusio alterius canon, which instructs
that when Congress includes one possibility in a statute, it
excludes another by implication. See Chevron U. S. A.
Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U.S.
73, 80–81 (2002). This rule reinforces what the text
makes clear. By limiting a court’s discretion to award costs
to cases brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment,
Congress foreclosed the award of costs in other
circumstances.[4]

															Petitioner’s interpretation of the statute
is also strongly favored by the rule that statutes should be read
to avoid superfluity. Under this “most basic of
interpretative canons, . . . ‘ “[a]
statute should be constructed so that effect is given to all of its
provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,
void or insignificant.” ’ ”
Corley v. United States, 556
U.S. 303, 314 (2009) (quoting Hibbs v. Winn,
542 U.S.
88, 101 (2004)). Respondent’s reading, as it mostly
acknowledges, renders the entire sentence meaningless because it
reiterates powers that federal courts already possess with respect
to both costs and attorney’s fees. See Brief for Respondent
22–24.

															The majority rejects this argument, citing the
rule that this canon “ ‘assists only where a
competing interpretation gives effect to every clause and word of a
statute.’ ” Ante, at 13 (quoting
Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564
U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12)). In its view, neither
of the available interpretations can eliminate superfluity because
the attorney’s fees provision is redundant under any reading.
Ante, at 13. But the canon against super- fluity surely
counsels against an interpretation that renders the entire
provision at issue superfluous when a competing interpretation
would at least render part of the provision meaningful. Nor does
the majority’s observation that redundancy is
“ ‘hardly unusual,’ ”
ante, at 14, in provisions relating to costs make the canon
inapplicable. While Congress sometimes drafts redundant language
with respect to costs, Congress did not do so in
§1692(a)(3).[5] Instead,
it drafted specific language that permits a court to award costs
only on the satisfaction of a condition.

															Interpreting §1692k(1)(3) as having a
negative implication is consistent with our construction of another
statute that includes similar language. In Cooper Industries,
Inc. v. Aviall Services, Inc., 543
U.S. 157, 166 (2004) (opinion for the Court by Thomas, J.), we
considered a provision in the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U. S. C.
§9613(f)(1) that provided: “[a]ny person may seek
contribution . . . during . . . any civil
action under section 9606 of this title” (emphasis
added). We rejected the argument that the word “may”
indicated that “during a civil action” was one but not
the exclusive circumstance in which the right of contribution was
available. 543 U. S., at 166. We instead adopted the natural
reading of the text, holding that a party’s ability to seek
contribution was limited by the phrase “during any civil
action” and that contribution was only available while a
lawsuit is pending. Ibid. The same logic applies here,
because §1692k(a)(3) imposes a closely analogous condition on
a court’s discretion to award costs.

															2

															The first sentence of §1692k(a)(3)
underscores that Congress implemented a different rule than Rule
54(d)(1). That sentence provides that a debt collector who violates
the FDCPA is “liable to” a prevailing plaintiff for
“the costs of the action, together with a reasonable
attorney’s fee as determined by the court.” This
sentence makes a losing defendant always liable for the
“costs of the action,” which is a clear departure from
the Rule 54(d)(1) discretionary default. Cf. Taniguchi v.
Kan Pacific Saipan, Ltd., 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)
(slip op., at 4). Because Congress deviated from Rule 54(d)(1) in
the first sentence of §1692k(a)(3), the most reasonable
reading is that the sentence that immediately follows, which states
the rule for prevailing defendants, takes a similar path.

															The majority believes that its reading of the
costs provision follows from the first sentence as well, but for a
different reason. Ante, at 11–12. It suggests that if
Congress had not included costs in the second sentence, a plaintiff
might have been able to argue that the inclusion of costs in the
first sentence and the exclusion of costs in the second indicated
that defendants could recover only fees when an action is brought
in bad faith. The majority then speculates that Congress included
costs in the second sentence to foreclose that argument.

															The text of the previous sentence makes plain,
however, that the second sentence departs from the Rule 54(d)(1)
default, and the majority offers no evidence in support of its
supposition that Congress intended a different meaning.[6] Moreover, I see no basis for
invoking potential confusion or indulging in speculation to explain
away the words Congress chose. Ante, at 11–12. Some
Members of the majority have expressed doubt about the relevance of
legislative history, claiming that relying upon it is analogous to
“entering a crowded cocktail party and looking
. . . for one’s friends.” Conroy v.
Aniskoff, 507 U.S.
511, 519 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). But
speculating whole cloth about congressional intent, as the majority
does, is surely more problematic. The majority is saved the trouble
of having to look for its friends at the party; it simply invites
them.

															II

															Reduced to its essence, the majority’s
analysis turns on reading §1692k(a)(3) in the context of what
it calls the “venerable presumption” that prevailing
parties are entitled to costs. See ante, at 4. Even if it
were appropriate to consider a background presumption rather than
reading the plain text at issue, the majority’s
characterization of the presumption is at best incomplete.

															First, the Court’s suggestion that the
presumption regarding costs is a “venerable” one in
American law is an overstatement. Ibid. It is true, as the
majority points out, that prior to the federal rules,
“prevailing parties were entitled to costs as of right in
actions at law while courts had discretion to award costs in equity
proceedings.” Ante, at 4, n. 3; see Wright &
Miller §2665, at 199. But the doctrine governing costs at law
carved out an important exception for statutory provisions that set
forth a differ- ent rule.[7]
Where there was such a statute, courts would simply apply it. In
its assessment of the background principles underlying its
approach, the majority glosses over the longstanding expectation
that Congress often enacts different rules with respect to costs,
and when it does, these rules govern.

															Second, Rule 54(d)(1) embraces this
long-recognized exception because it specifies that a statute can
displace its default rule. To repeat, Rule 54(d)(1) merely enacts a
default standard that applies unless, among other things, a statute
or rule “provides otherwise.” Here, for the reasons
explained, Congress enacted exactly such a statute. That is clear
from the text, because §1692k(a)(3) conditions the award of
costs on the satisfaction of a condition, and because the previous
sentence of the same provision breaks from the default.

															*  *  *

															The plain text of Rule 54(d)(1) and
§1692k(a)(3) dictates the result in this case. Accordingly, I
would reverse the Tenth Circuit and hold that §1692k(a)(3)
“provides otherwise” than Rule 54(d)(1), such that a
district court cannot award costs to a prevailing defendant in an
FDCPA action except upon a showing that the action was brought in
bad faith and for the purpose of harassment. I respectfully
dissent.

Notes

 The original codification
of the Rule provided that “[e]xcept when express
provision therefor is made either in a statute of the
United States or in these rules, costs shall be allowed as of
course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise
directs.” Ante, at 6 (quoting the Rule; emphasis
added; internal quotation marks omitted). The language in the Rule
was later revised to its current form in 2007, but as the majority
acknowledges, the Rules Committee indicated the changes were
“ ‘stylistic only.’ ”

“[v]irtually every dictionary we are aware of says that
‘to modify’ means to change moderately or in minor

 The majority suggests
that this canon does not apply to §1692k(a)(3) because it only
aids where “ ‘it is fair to suppose that Congress
considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to
it.’ ” Ante, at 9 (quoting Barnhart
v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S.
149, 168 (2003)). The best evidence of congressional intent,
however, is the statutory text that Congress enacted. West
Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S.
83, 98 (1991). And here, the plain language of
§1692k(a)(3) makes it clear that Congress meant to foreclose
other possible meanings. See supra, at 5.

U. S. C. § 6104(d) (Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud

and costs”); see also 28 U. S. C. §1332(b)
(failure to recover jurisdictional amount).

 The majority does not
explain why its speculation about legislative intent is more
persuasive than the Solicitor General’s view that saddling
potential plaintiffs with costs would undermine the FDCPA’s
“ ‘calibrated scheme’ ” of
enforcement. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10
(quoting Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer &
Ulrich, L. P. A., 559 U.S.
573, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 29)). Under the Solicitor
General’s interpretation, because the recoveries in these
cases are not certain to be large, consumers may be deterred from
bringing FDCPA claims if they are faced with the risk of paying
costs. See Brief for United States 21–28. This outcome would
thwart Congress’s expectation that the FDCPA was to be
primarily enforced by consumers. Ibid.
