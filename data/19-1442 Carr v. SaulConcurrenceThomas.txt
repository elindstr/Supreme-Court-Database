															ANDREW M. SAUL, COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY

															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[April 22, 2021]

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch and Justice Barrett join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I join Parts I, II–A, and II–B–2 of the opinion of the Court, which correctly explain that the nonadversarial nature of an agency proceeding generally gives good reason to refrain from creating an issue-exhaustion requirement.  See Sims v. Apfel,

530 U.S. 103, 109–110 (2000).  Proceedings before an administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Social Security Administration are plainly nonadversarial: The regulations assure claimants that the agency will “conduct the administrative review process in an informal, non-adversarial manner.”  20 CFR §404.900(b) (2020).  ALJs can raise new issues sua sponte.  §§404.944, 404.946.  Hearings are so informal that lawyers, briefs, and even attendance are often optional.  §§404.948–404.950.  And should an ALJ err, the Appeals Council may review cases to correct anything from “error[s] of law” to “broad policy or procedural issue[s] that may affect the general public interest.”  §404.970(a).  This decidedly pro-claimant, inquisitorial process is quite unlike an adversarial suit in which parties are expected to identify, argue, and preserve all issues.

															To be sure, a few regulatory provisions direct claimants to advocate on their own behalf by objecting to problems, including if the agency misidentifies issues before the hearing or if the ALJ is “prejudiced or partial.”  §§404.938–404.940.  But these unsurprising reminders that a claimant should not sit idly on the sidelines hardly demand that the penalty for overlooking an argument is forfeiture.  On the contrary, such a permanent consequence would be surprising in light of the flexible, “informal” mechanisms that undergird the entire agency review process.  §404.900(b); see also Sims, 530 U. S., at 110 (plurality opinion) (“The differences between courts and agencies are nowhere more pronounced than in Social Security proceedings”).

															Because these proceedings bear little resemblance to adversarial litigation, I agree with the Court that there is no need for an exhaustion rule.  I would end the analysis there.
