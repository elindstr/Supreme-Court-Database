															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 20–107

															CEDAR POINT NURSERY, et al., PETITIONERS v. VICTORIA HASSID, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 23, 2021]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion, which carefully adheres to constitutional text, history, and precedent.  I write separately to explain that, in my view, the Court’s precedent in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co.,

351 U.S. 105 (1956), also strongly supports today’s decision.

															In Babcock, the National Labor Relations Board argued that the National Labor Relations Act afforded union organizers a right to enter company property to communicate with employees.  Several employers responded that the Board’s reading of the Act would infringe their
 
Fifth Amendment property rights.  The employers contended that Congress, “even if it could constitutionally do so, has at no time shown any intention of destroying property rights secured by the 
 
Fifth Amendment, in protecting employees’ rights of collective bargaining under the Act.  Until Congress should evidence such intention by specific legislative language, our courts should not construe the Act on such dangerous constitutional grounds.”  Brief for Respondent in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., O. T. 1955, No. 250, pp. 18–19.

															This Court agreed with the employers’ argument that the Act should be interpreted to avoid unconstitutionality.  The Court reasoned that “the National Government” via the Constitution “preserves property rights,” including “the right to exclude from property.”  Babcock, 351 U. S., at 112.  Against the backdrop of the Constitution’s strong protection of property rights, the Court interpreted the Act to afford access to union organizers only when “needed,” ibid.—that is, when the employees live on company property and union organizers have no other reasonable means of communicating with the employees, id., at 113.  See also Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB,

502 U.S. 527, 540–541 (1992).  As I read it, Babcock recognized that employers have a basic
 
Fifth Amendment right to exclude from their private property, subject to a “necessity” exception similar to that noted by the Court today.  Ante, at 19.

															Babcock strongly supports the growers’ position in today’s case because the California union access regulation intrudes on the growers’ property rights far more than Babcock allows.  When this same California union access regulation was challenged on constitutional grounds before the California Supreme Court in 1976, that court upheld the regulation by a 4-to-3 vote.  Agricultural Labor Rel. Bd. v. Superior Ct. of Tulare Cty., 16 Cal. 3d 392, 546 P.2d 687.  Justice William Clark wrote the dissent.  Justice Clark stressed that “property rights are fundamental.”  Id., at 429, n. 4, 546 P. 2d, at 712, n. 4.  And he concluded that the California union access regulation “violates the rule” of Babcock and thus “violates the constitutional provisions protecting private property.”  16 Cal. 3d, at 431, 546 P. 2d, at 713.  In my view, Justice Clark had it exactly right.

															With those comments, I join the Court’s opinion in full.
