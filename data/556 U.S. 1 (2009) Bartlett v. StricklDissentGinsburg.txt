															GARY BARTLETT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NORTH
CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, et al., PETITIONERS
v. DWIGHT STRICKLAND et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of north
carolina

															[March 9, 2009]

															   Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.

															   I join Justice Souter’s
powerfully persuasive dissenting opinion, and would make concrete
what is implicit in his exposition. The plurality’s
interpretation of §2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is
difficult to fathom and severely undermines the statute’s
estimable aim. Today’s decision returns the ball to
Congress’ court. The Legislature has just cause to clarify
beyond debate the appropriate reading of §2.
