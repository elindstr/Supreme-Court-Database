SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-9046

															CHARLES RUSSELL RHINES, PETITIONER v.
DOUGLAS WEBER, WARDEN

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the eighth circuit

															[March 30, 2005]

															   Justice Stevens, with whom
Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, concurring.

															   While I join the Court's opinion,
I do so on the understanding that its reference to “good
cause” for failing to exhaust state remedies more promptly,
ante, at 7, is not intended to impose the sort of strict
and inflexible requirement that would “ ‘trap the
unwary pro se prisoner.’ ” Rose
v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 520
(1982); see also Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 487
(2000).
