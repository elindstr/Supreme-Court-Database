															LE ROY TORRES, PETITIONER v. TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of texas, thirteenth district

															[June 29, 2022]

															

															Justice Kagan, concurring.

															In my view, our sovereign immunity decisions have not followed a straight line.  Two years ago, I described Katz’s “plan of the Convention” analysis as “good for one clause only”—i.e., Article I’s Bankruptcy Clause.  Allen v. Cooper, 589 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2020) (slip op., at 8–9) (hyphens omitted); see Central Va. Community College v. Katz,

546 U.S. 356, 373–379 (2006).  I thought then that our precedents had shut the door on further Article I exceptions to state sovereign immunity.  But PennEast proved me wrong.  See PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New Jersey, 594 U. S. ___ (2021).  The question there was whether the States had consented in the plan of the Convention to the Federal Government’s exercise of Article I’s eminent domain power, including through private parties’ suits.  Relying on our prior decisions, I concluded that the States had not so consented.  See id., at ___–___ (Barrett, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1–4).  But the Court ruled otherwise.  Using a new test, it held that the eminent domain power was “complete in itself,” meaning that the States had “consented to the [federal] exercise of that power[ ] in its entirety.”  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 22).  The question today, given PennEast, is whether the same is true of the war powers.  Were those powers also “complete in themselves,” so that the States likewise consented to congressionally authorized private litigation?

															The answer is yes, as the Court holds.  Much more than eminent domain, war powers lie at the heart of the Convention’s plan.  The overriding goal of the Convention was “to create a cohesive national sovereign in response to the failings of the Articles of Confederation.”  Ibid.  And among those failings, none was more important than “the want of power in Congress to raise an army and the dependence upon the States” to provide armed forces.  Selective Draft Law Cases,

245 U.S. 366, 381 (1918).  For that reason, the war powers—more than any other power, and surely more than eminent domain—were “complete in themselves.”  They were given by the States, entirely and exclusively, to the Federal Government.  See ante, at 7–12; U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cls. 11–16, §10, cls. 1, 3.  PennEast’s analysis thus compels today’s result.  In setting out the “complete in itself ” test, the Court there answered the question here: At the Convention, the States waived their sovereign immunity to any suit Congress authorized under the war powers.
