That the extension of the boundary southerly from the point where the line forming the boundary between Texas and Louisiana southerly from the Arkansas boundary, intersects the geographical middle of the Sabine River (Latitude 3159' 56.225" North, Longitude 9402'33.105" West, said point being taken from the United States Geological Survey Quadrangle Center, Tex.-La. 1958 Edition) to the mid-point between the gulfward extension of the Sabine Pass jetties Latitude 2938'37.329" North, Longitude 9349'30.940" West hereby is established.

															Said boundary commences at Latitude 3159'56.225" North and Longitude 9402'33.105" West, thence proceeding in a southerly direction along the Sabine River using the federal line as shown for the boundary on the United States Geological Survey Quadrangle Center, Tex.-La., 1958 Edition (photorevised 1969) and signed by Hatley N.

The United States and Texas do not hold title to or interest in any island in the east half of the Sabine River.
