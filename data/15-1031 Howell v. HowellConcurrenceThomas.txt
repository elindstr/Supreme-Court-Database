															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															JOHN HOWELL, PETITIONER v. SANDRA HOWELL

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of arizona

															[May 15, 2017]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I join all of the opinion of the Court except its brief discussion of “purposes and objectives” pre-emption.  Ante, at 8.  As I have previously explained, “[t]hat framework is an illegitimate basis for finding the pre-emption of state law.”  Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1); see also Wyeth v. Levine,

555 U. S. 555,
583 (2009)
 (same).  In any event, that framework is not necessary to support the Court’s judgment in this case.
