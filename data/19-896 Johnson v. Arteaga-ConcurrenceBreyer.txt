															TAE D. JOHNSON, ACTING DIRECTOR OF U. S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCE- MENT, et al., PETITIONERS v. ANTONIO ARTEAGA-MARTINEZ

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit

															[June 13, 2022]

															

															Justice Breyer, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

															The Government can normally detain persons unlawfully present in, and ordered removed from, the United States for a 90-day statutory “removal period.”

8 U. S. C. §1231(a).  However, §1231(a)(6) provides that the Attorney General may sometimes hold such a person in custody for a longer period.  It says:

															“An alien ordered removed [1] who is inadmissible [2] [or] removable [as a result of violations of status requirements or entry conditions, certain violations of criminal law, or reasons of security or foreign policy] or [3] who has been determined by the Attorney General to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal, may be detained beyond the removal period . . . .”

															In Zadvydas v. Davis,

533 U.S. 678, 689 (2001), “we read an implicit limitation into” this provision.  Because a “statute permitting indefinite detention of an alien would raise a serious constitutional problem,” we held that the “statute, read in light of the Constitution’s demands, limits an alien’s post-removal-period detention to a period reasonably necessary to bring about that alien’s removal from the United States.  It does not permit indefinite detention.”  Id., at 689–690; see also id., at 690–696 (explaining potential constitutional concerns presented by indefinite detention under §1231(a)(6)).

															We also held that the period reasonably necessary to effect removal was presumptively six months.  Id., at 701.  “[W]e recognize[d] that period” “for the sake of uniform administration in the federal courts.”  Ibid.  But “[a]fter this 6-month period, once the alien provides good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future, the Government must respond with evidence sufficient to rebut that showing.  And for detention to remain reasonable, as the period of prior postremoval confinement grows, what counts as the ‘reasonably foreseeable future’ conversely would have to shrink.”  Ibid.

															In my view, Zadvydas controls the outcome here.  The statutory language is identical, which is not surprising, for this case concerns the same statutory provision.  There are two conceivable differences between this case and Zadvydas, but both argue in favor of applying Zadvydas’ holding here.

															First, the respondent here, Antonio Arteaga-Martinez, has been ordered removed, and is therefore subject to §1231(a), for a different reason than the persons whose cases we considered in Zadvydas.  Kestutis Zadvydas and Kim Ho Ma were ordered removed because they had been convicted of serious crimes.  Id., at 684–685.  Zadvydas had committed drug crimes, attempted robbery, attempted burglary, and theft; Ma was involved in a gang-related shooting and convicted of manslaughter.  Ibid.  Arteaga-Martinez’s only crime (besides minor traffic violations) is entering the United States without inspection.  Ante, at 2.  The Government seeks to detain him while an immigration judge considers his claim that he will be persecuted or tortured if he is returned to Mexico.  Ante, at 2–3.  There is less reason, not more, to detain Arteaga-Martinez without bail.

															Second, Zadvydas provided for outright release, 533 U. S., at 699–700; this case involves a bail hearing.  Again, the Government has less reason to detain a person when the alternative is a bail hearing (where the Government has an opportunity to show that that person might pose a danger to the community or a flight risk) than when the alternative is simply release.

															The Government argues that a later case, Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U. S. ___ (2018), dictates the result here, rather than Zadvydas.  Not at all.  That later case involved detention under statutes other than the one at issue here and in Zadvydas.  Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (“The primary issue is the proper interpretation of §§1225(b), 1226(a), and 1226(c)”).  The Court in Jennings did not modify or overrule Zadvydas, but rather explicitly distinguished that case.  Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  It did so on multiple grounds, including the fact that almost all of the statutes at issue in Jennings used words that mandated detention, such as “shall,” rather than words of discretion, such as “may.”  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 16, 19).  In Zadvydas, the word “may” created ambiguity that permitted the Court to interpret §1231(a)(6) (the statute before us) in a manner that avoided the constitutional problem that indefinite detention could have created.  533 U. S., at 697.  The majority in Jennings held that the statutory provisions at issue there were not similarly ambiguous, and therefore did not permit the Court to reach a similar interpretation.  583 U. S., at ___, ___–___ (slip op., at 17, 22–23).

															It is true that one of the statutes interpreted in Jennings, §1226(a), said that the Attorney General “may . . . arres[t] and detai[n an alien] pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed,” or “may release the alien on . . . bond . . . or . . . conditional parole.”  Why did this statute not give the Court the textual leeway needed to permit a bail hearing (given the constitutional problem posed by potentially indefinite detention)?  Here is the Court’s answer to that question in its entirety:

															“The Court of Appeals ordered the Government to provide procedural protections that go well beyond the initial bond hearing established by existing regulations—namely, periodic bond hearings every six months in which the Attorney General must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the alien’s continued detention is necessary.  Nothing in §1226(a)’s text—which says only that the Attorney General ‘may release’ the alien ‘on . . . bond’—even remotely supports the imposition of either of those requirements.  Nor does §1226(a)’s text even hint that the length of detention prior to a bond hearing must specifically be considered in determining whether the alien should be released.”  Jennings, 583 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 22–23) (emphasis added).

															The court below did not order periodic bond hearings, but it did require the Government to satisfy a “clear and convincing evidence” standard.  Ante, at 3.  I agree that Jennings forecloses this latter requirement.  Otherwise, I would find the lower courts’ bail hearing requirements reasonable implementations of the Zadvydas standard, which is applicable here.

															Since the Court remands this case for further proceedings, I would add that, in my view, Zadvydas applies (the Court does not hold to the contrary), and the parties are free to argue about the proper way to implement Zadvydas’ standard in this context, and, if necessary, to consider the underlying constitutional question, a matter that this Court has not decided.
