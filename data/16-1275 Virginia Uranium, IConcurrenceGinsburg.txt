															VIRGINIA URANIUM, INC., et al., PETITIONERS v. JOHN WARREN, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 17, 2019]

															

															Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan join, concurring in the judgment.

															Soon after discovery of a large deposit of uranium ore in Virginia in the late 1970s, the Commonwealth banned uranium mining.  Petitioners (collectively, Virginia Uranium) now seek to mine that deposit.  They challenge the Commonwealth’s uranium mining ban as preempted by the Atomic Energy Act (AEA or Act),

42 U. S. C. §2011 et seq., either because the ban intrudes on the federally occupied field of nuclear safety, or because it obstructs realization of federal purposes and objectives.

															I reach the same bottom-line judgment as does Justice Gorsuch: The Commonwealth’s mining ban is not preempted.  And I agree with much contained in Justice Gorsuch’s opinion.  See ante, at 4–10.  But his discussion of the perils of inquiring into legislative motive, see ante, at 11–14, sweeps well beyond the confines of this case, and therefore seems to me inappropriate in an opinion speaking for the Court, rather than for individual members of the Court.  Further, Virginia Uranium’s obstacle preemption arguments fail under existing doctrine, so there is little reason to question, as Justice Gorsuch does, see ante, at 14–16, whether that doctrine should be retained.  For these reasons, I join the Court’s judgment, and separately state how I would resolve the instant controversy.

															I

															A

															The production of nuclear fuel begins with mining uranium, a radioactive metal.  See ante, at 1–2; Brief for Former Nuclear Regulators as Amici Curiae 7.  Conventionally, uranium ore is mined and then “milled”—crushed and treated with chemicals that extract the usable ura- nium.  Ibid.  The resulting concentrated uranium oxide, known as yellowcake, is shipped elsewhere for conversion, enrichment, and fabrication into fuel.  Ibid.  Producing just a pound of usable uranium requires milling hundreds or even thousands of pounds of ore.  H. R. Rep. No. 95–1480, pt. 1, p. 11 (1978).  Milling thus generates vast quantities of “tailings”: Sandy waste that is radioactive, contains toxic heavy metals, ibid., and must “be carefully regulated, monitored, and controlled,” U. S. NRC, Con- ventional Uranium Mills (rev. May 15, 2017), https://www .nrc.gov /materials /uranium - recovery /extraction - methods / conventional-mills.html (as last visited June 12, 2019).  Milling and tailings storage typically occur within 30 miles of the place where uranium is mined.  Ibid.

															The Federal Government regulates much of this process, primarily to protect public health and safety from radiation, but also for national security reasons.  English v. General Elec. Co.,

496 U.S. 72, 81–82 (1990); Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm’n,

461 U.S. 190, 207, 211–212 (1983) (PG&E).  Under the AEA, a federal license is required to, inter alia, “transfer or receive in interstate commerce” nontrivial quantities of “source material,” including uranium ore, “after removal from its place of deposit in nature,” §§2092, 2014(z).  See also §§2091–2099.  Licensing requirements also apply to the production, possession, or disposal of “byproduct material,” including tailings.  See §§2014(e), 2111–2114.  Federal regulations govern, as well, subsequent processes, including uranium enrichment and nuclear power generation.  See, e.g., §§2131–2142.

															The Federal Government does not regulate conventional uranium mining on private land, having long taken the position that its authority begins “at the mill, rather than at the mine.”  In re Hydro Resources, Inc., 63 N. R. C. 510, 512–513 (2006); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4.  See also ante, at 4–6.  And while the Federal Government has exclusive authority over the radiation hazards of milling and subsequent stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, States may regulate these activities for other purposes.  See §2018 (AEA does not affect state authority over “the generation, sale, or transmission of electric power produced” by nuclear powerplants); English, 496 U. S., at 81–82; PG&E, 461 U. S., at 207, 211–212.

															The AEA provides a means by which States may take over federal responsibility for regulating the nuclear safety aspects of milling and the disposal of tailings.  See

42 U. S. C. §2021.  In 1959, Congress amended the AEA to “recognize the interests of the States in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and to clarify the respective responsibilities under th[e] Act of the States and [federal authorities] with respect to the regulation of byproduc[t and] source . . . materials.”  Act of Sept. 23, 1959,

73Stat.
688, as amended,

42 U. S. C. §2021(a)(1).  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and a State may agree for the former to devolve to the latter authority to regulate source or byproduct materials “for the protection of the public health and safety from radiation hazards.”  §2021(b).  “During the duration of such an agreement . . . the State shall have authority to regulate the materials covered by the agreement for the protection of the public health and safety from radiation hazards.”  Ibid.  Section 2021(c) prohibits the NRC, however, from devolving its authority over “more dangerous activities—such as nuclear reactors.”  S. Rep. No. 870, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1959).  Finally, and of critical importance to this case, §2021(k) provides that “[n]othing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of any State or local agency to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.”

															In the late 1970s, uranium ore was discovered under Coles Hill, an unincorporated community in Pittsylvania County, Virginia.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 216a.  Totaling 119 million pounds of uranium ore, the deposit is the Nation's largest.  Id., at 201a.  See also 848 F.3d 590, 593 (CA4 2017) (case below).  After a private company began leasing mineral rights to the deposit, the Virginia General Assembly directed the state Coal and Energy Commission to study the effects on the environment and public health of uranium exploration, mining, and milling.  H. J. Res. No. 324, 1981 Va. Acts p. 1404; App. to Pet. for Cert. 216a.

															The next year, the General Assembly authorized ura- nium exploration but imposed a one-year moratorium on uranium mining.  1982 Va. Acts ch. 269.  The Assembly’s stated purpose was “to encourage and promote the safe and efficient exploration for uranium resources within the Commonwealth, and to assure . . . that uranium mining and milling will be subject to statutes and regulations which protect the environment and the health and safety of the public.”  Ibid.  The Assembly soon extended the ban “until a program for permitting uranium mining is established by statute.”  1983 Va. Acts ch. 3.  The Commonwealth has not established a permitting program, so the ban remains in force.

															A slowdown in construction of new nuclear powerplants in the 1980s contributed to a “precipitous decline in the price of uranium ore.”  Huffman v. Western Nuclear, Inc.,

486 U.S. 663, 666–667, and n. 5 (1988).  Rising prices in the first decade of the new millennium prompted renewed interest in mining the deposit, and Virginia Uranium lobbied to have the ban repealed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 222a; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9.

															When efforts to persuade the state legislature proved unsuccessful, Virginia Uranium brought this suit seeking a declaration that the ban is preempted by federal law and an injunction requiring the Commonwealth to issue uranium mining permits.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 237a.  Respondents, Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy officials (together, the Commonwealth Defendants), moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, and the District Court granted the motion.  Virginia Uranium, Inc. v. McAuliffe, 147 F. Supp. 3d 462, 478 (WD Va. 2015).[1]  The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding in principal part that because the Commonwealth’s mining ban did not regulate an activity overseen by the NRC, there was no need to consider the purposes for which the ban was imposed.  848 F. 3d, at 597–598.  Given the importance of the issue, and to resolve a division of authority among the Courts of Appeals, we granted Virginia Uranium’s petition for a writ of certiorari.  Compare id., at 594–599 (case below), with, e.g., Skull Valley Band of Goshute Indians v. Nielson, 376 F.3d 1223, 1246 (CA10 2004) (state laws grounded in nuclear safety concerns are preempted).

															II

															Under the Supremacy Clause, the “Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof,” are “the supreme Law of the Land.”  Art. VI, cl. 2.  “Put simply, federal law preempts contrary state law.”  Hughes v. Talen Energy Marketing, LLC, 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 11).

															This Court has delineated three circumstances in which state law must yield to federal law.  English, 496 U. S., at 78–79.  First, and most obvious, federal law operates exclusively when Congress expressly preempts state law.  Ibid.  Second, state law can play no part when “Congress has legislated comprehensively to occupy an entire field of regulation, leaving no room for the States to supplement federal law.”  Hughes, 578 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Third, state law is rendered inoperative when it “actually conflicts with federal law,” English, 496 U. S., at 79, as when a private party cannot “comply with both state and federal requirements,” Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. v. Albrecht, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted), or when state law “creates an unaccept- able ‘obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,’ ” Wyeth v. Levine,

555 U.S. 555, 563–564 (2009) (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz,

312 U.S. 52, 67 (1941)).  Whatever the category of preemption asserted, “the purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone” in determining whether federal law preempts state law.  Hughes, 578 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (internal quotation marks omitted). Virginia Uranium invokes both field and obstacle preemption; I address each in turn.

															A

															Virginia Uranium’s primary contention is that Congress has occupied the field of nuclear safety regulation, preempting state laws enacted because of concerns about the radiation safety of federally regulated activities.  Defining the preempted field by reference to the purpose for which state laws were enacted finds “some support in the text of the [AEA],” English, 496 U. S., at 84, and, in particular, §2021(k).  Again, this provision states that “[n]othing in [§2021] shall be construed to affect the authority of any State . . . to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.”  (Emphasis added.)  Section 2021(k) presupposes federal preemption of at least some state laws enacted to guard “against radiation hazards.”  Virginia Uranium and the dissent read this subsection to include within the preempted sphere all state laws motivated by concerns about the radiation hazards of NRC-regulated activities.  Brief for Petitioners 35; post, at 2.  The Commonwealth Defendants would exclude from federal foreclosure state laws directed to activities not regulated by the NRC.  E.g., Tr. of Oral Arg. 33–34.  The Commonwealth Defendants have the better reading of the statute.

															1

															The Commonwealth has forbidden only conventional uranium mining on private land, an activity all agree is not federally regulated.  E.g., id., at 9–10, 17–18, 30.  The controlling AEA provision, §2092, triggers federal regulation only when source material is “remov[ed] from its place of deposit in nature.”  Federal authorities have long read that provision to preclude federal regulation of conventional uranium mining.  Ante, at 4; supra, at 4.  In contrast to the AEA’s express provisions for uranium mining on public lands, §§2097–2098, the Act is nearly silent about conventional uranium mining on private lands.  See ante, at 4–6.  Indeed, insofar as the Act addresses private conventional mining, it does so to bar federal regulators from obtaining reports about ore “prior to removal from its place of deposit in nature.”  §2095.  Every indication, then, is that Congress left private conventional mining unregulated.  And if Congress did not provide for regulation of private conventional mining, it is hard to see how or why state law on the subject would be preempted, whatever the reason for the law’s enactment.

															2

															Virginia Uranium’s argument to the contrary rests on §2021(k), but that provision, correctly read, lends no support for Virginia Uranium’s cause.  By its terms, §2021(k) addresses only state authority to regulate “activities” for nonradiological purposes.  Read in context of §2021 as a whole, “activities” means activities regulated by the NRC.  See §2021(c), (l), (m), (o); ante, at 6 (§2021(k) “might be described as a non-preemption clause”).

															The AEA’s context and history are corroborative.  Prior to enactment of §2021(k), the Federal Government and States shared responsibility for most steps of the nuclear fuel cycle, with the former regulating primarily for public health and safety, and the latter regulating for economic and other nonradiological purposes.  See supra, at 4.  Section 2021 was designed “to heighten the States’ role,” PG&E, 461 U. S., at 209, by enabling federal regulators to cede their previously exclusive authority over the nuclear safety of several lower risk activities, §2021(b).  Given this aim, §2021(k) is most sensibly read to clarify that the door newly opened for state regulation left in place pre-existing state authority “to regulate activities for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.”  See ante, at 5–6.  The House and Senate Reports are explicit on this point: Section §2021(k) was “intended to make it clear that the bill does not impair the State[s’] authority to regulate activities of [federal] licensees for the manifold health, safety, and economic purposes other than radiation protection”; the bill simply provides a means for States to obtain heretofore exclusively federal authority to regulate these activities for “protection against radiation hazards.”  S. Rep. No. 870, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., at 12; accord H. R. Rep. No. 1125, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 12 (1959).  Nothing suggests that Congress “intended to cut back on pre-existing state authority outside the NRC’s jurisdiction.”  PG&E, 461 U. S., at 209–210.  That authority encompassed state laws regulating conventional uranium mining, even if enacted because of concerns about the radiological safety of postextraction, NRC-regulated steps in the nuclear fuel cycle.

															3

															Virginia Uranium leans most heavily on a statement in the Court’s PG&E opinion: “[T]he Federal Government has occupied the entire field of nuclear safety concerns.”  461 U. S., at 212.  But in neither PG&E nor in later decisions in its wake, Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.,

464 U.S. 238 (1984), and English,

496 U.S. 72, did the Court rest preemption on the purposes for which state laws were enacted.  Indeed, in all three, the Court held that the state laws at issue were not preempted.  See ante, at 7–10.

															Moreover, without gainsaying that it may sometimes be appropriate to inquire into the purpose for which a state law was enacted, PG&E calls for no such inquiry here.  PG&E considered whether the AEA preempted a California law conditioning approval to build new nuclear plants on a finding that an adequate method existed for disposing of spent nuclear fuel.  461 U. S., at 197–198.  The Court upheld the law because it was enacted out of concern for economic development, not because of radiation safety hazards.  Id., at 205, 213–216.

															It is unsurprising that the PG&E Court asked why the California law had been enacted.  The State’s law addressed construction of a nuclear powerplant, an activity closely regulated by the Federal Government for nuclear safety purposes.  See 42 U. S. C. §§2021(c)(1), 2132–2142; 10 CFR pt. 50 (2018).  The Court therefore inquired whether the state law was enacted, in §2021(k)’s words, “for purposes other than protection against radiation hazards.”  Here, in contrast, the Commonwealth’s mining ban targets an exclusively state-regulated activity.  See ante, at 8–10.[2]

															4

															I am not persuaded by the Solicitor General’s argument that the Commonwealth’s mining ban is preempted because it is a pretext for regulating the radiological safety hazards of milling and tailings storage.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28–30.  To the degree the AEA preempts state laws enacted for certain purposes, §2021(k) stakes out the boundaries of the preempted field, i.e., state laws that apply to federally licensed activities and are driven by concerns about the radiological safety of those activities.  We have no license to expand those boundaries.

															The case on which the Solicitor General primarily relies, National Meat Assn. v. Harris,

565 U.S. 452 (2012), does not counsel otherwise.  National Meat concerned a set of California laws that “dictat[ed] what slaughterhouses must do with pigs that cannot walk, known in the trade as nonambulatory pigs.”  Id., at 455.  The question presented: Did California’s prescriptions conflict with the Federal Meat Inspection Act’s express preemption of state law that imposed requirements “in addition to, or different than those made under” the Act?

21 U. S. C. §678.  One of the California provisions, a ban on the sale of meat or products from nonambulatory pigs, regulated a subject outside the scope of the Federal Meat Inspection Act.  National Meat, 565 U. S., at 463.  The Court nevertheless concluded that the sale ban fell within the scope of the Act’s express preemption clause because it was intended to work together with other California provisions to impose additional requirements on slaughterhouse operations.  Id., at 463–464.

															National Meat is not controlling here.  No express preemption provision is involved.  The mining ban sets no safety standards for federally supervised milling or tailings storage activities.  True enough, the ban makes it far less likely, though not impossible, that such activities will take place in the Commonwealth.[3]  In that regard, the Commonwealth’s mining ban is more aptly analogized to state bans on slaughtering horses, upheld by courts of appeals and distinguished in National Meat from California’s nonambulatory pig laws.  Horse slaughtering bans, National Meat explained, “work[ed] at a remove from the sites and activities that the FMIA most directly governs” by ensuring that “no horses will be delivered to, inspected at, or handled by a slaughterhouse, because no horses will be ordered for purchase in the first instance.”  Id., at 465, 467 (citing Cavel Int’l, Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F.3d 551 (CA7 2007), and Empacadora de Carnes de Fresnillo, S. A. de C. V. v. Curry, 476 F.3d 326 (CA5 2007)).  The distinction drawn in National Meat thus supports this conclusion: A state law regulating an upstream activity within the State’s authority is not preempted simply because a downstream activity falls within a federally occupied field.[4]

															B

															Nor is the Commonwealth’s mining ban preempted as an “unacceptable obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.”  Wyeth, 555 U. S., at 563–564 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Together, Virginia Uranium and the United States identify four ways in which the mining ban supposedly conflicts with federal purposes and objectives.  None carry the day.

															First, Virginia Uranium contends that the mining ban conflicts with the “delicate balance” federal law has struck between promoting nuclear power and ensuring public safety.  Brief for Petitioners 55–56; see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31–33.  But the Federal Government does not regulate the radiological safety of conventional uranium mining on private land, so federal law struck no balance in this area.

															Second, Virginia Uranium contends that the mining ban “prohibit[s] the achievement of one of Congress[’] ‘primary purpose[s]’: ‘the promotion of nuclear power.’ ”  Brief for Petitioners 56 (quoting PG&E, 461 U. S., at 221).  PG&E, however, dismissed the suggestion that Congress had a policy of promoting nuclear power “at all costs.”  Id., at 222 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Given the absence of federal regulation in point, it is improbable that the Federal Government has a purpose or objective of promoting conventional uranium mining on private land.  Cf. ante, at 16.

															Virginia Uranium warns of dire consequences if all 50 States enact bans similar to the Commonwealth’s.  Brief for Petitioners 56–57.  But, as the Court of Appeals explained, numerous domestic uranium recovery facilities are federally regulated (either because they sit on federal land or use unconventional mining techniques) and are “thus beyond the reach of any state bans”; and the AEA authorizes the Federal Government to develop uranium deposits on public lands and to acquire private deposits.  848 F. 3d, at 599; see 42 U. S. C. §§2096–2097.  Federal purposes and objectives do not require judicial supplementation of the AEA’s express provisions for maintaining the uranium supply.  Cf. ante, at 17.

															The dissent suggests that national security may require further domestic uranium production.  Post, at 2, n. 2.  If the Executive Branch—which presumably knows more about “the critical role of uranium to the country’s energy industry and national defense,” ibid.—agrees, it can arrange for acquisition of the site by the United States, and then for commencement of mining notwithstanding the Commonwealth’s ban.  Yet the site remains in private hands.

															Third, Virginia Uranium argues that §2021 provides the sole means for States to regulate radiological safety hazards resulting from milling and tailings storage, and that Virginia has effectively regulated milling and tailings storage without obtaining authority to do so through an adequate §2021 agreement.  Brief for Petitioners 57–59 (citing Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn.,

505 U.S. 88, 98–101 (1992)); see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 33–34.  As explained, see supra, at 7–9, 11, Virginia has not regulated the radiological safety of tailings storage; it has prohibited only an antecedent activity subject to exclusive state authority.

															Finally, the United States contends that Virginia’s mining ban frustrates federal purposes and objectives by “prevent[ing] the occurrence of” activities that Congress intended the Federal Government to regulate.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31 (quoting 848 F. 3d, at 600 (Traxler, J., dissenting)).  But federal regulation of certain activities does not mean that States must authorize activities antecedent to those federally regulated.  For example, federal regulation of nuclear powerplants does not demand that States allow the construction of such powerplants in the first place.  PG&E, 461 U. S., at 222.

															*  *  *

															For the reasons stated, I concur in the Court’s judgment affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
Notes
1
 The District Court also dismissed the Commonwealth’s Governor and several other state officials as defendants on the ground that the
 
Eleventh Amendment barred suit against them.  Virginia Ura-nium, Inc. v. McAuliffe, 147 F. Supp. 3d 462, 467–468 (WD Va. 2015).  Virginia Uranium did not appeal from that part of the District Court’s decision. 

2
 The dissent insists that we are bound by language in Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm’n,

461 U.S. 190 (1983) (PG&E ), unnecessary to that decision.  Post, at 4–6.  But as Justice Gorsuch explains, PG&E ’s inquiry into the purpose for which some state laws were enacted does not mean we must now extend that inquiry to all state laws.  Ante, at 10 (“Being in for a dime doesn’t mean we have to be in for a dollar.”). 

3
 Were a similar deposit found over the state line, the mining ban at issue would not prevent uranium ore mined in North Carolina from being milled, and the resulting tailings stored, in the Commonwealth. 

4
 The distinction drawn here does not turn, as the dissent misperceives, post, at 8, on whether the state-regulated activity is upstream or downstream of the federally preempted field.  The Commonwealth regulated an activity, conventional uranium mining, that Congress left to state regulation.  Again, nothing in the AEA shows that Congress intended to preempt such a law based on the purpose for which it was enacted.
