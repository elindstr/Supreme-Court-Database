															Department of Education, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. Myra Brown, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 30, 2023]

															

															Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															In August 2022, the Secretary of Education
announced a large-scale student-loan forgiveness program. He
pledged to discharge hundreds of billions of dollars in
student-loan debt owed by millions of borrowers. According to the
Secretary, the discharge was necessary to alleviate hardship caused
by the impending resumption of loan repayments, which had been
suspended during the multi-year coronavirus pandemic, and he
therefore invoked authority that he claimed he enjoyed under the
Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003
(HEROES Act). 117Stat. 904, codified at 20 U. S. C.
§1070 et seq. The following month, the Secretary
directed that specific actions be taken to implement the
loan-forgiveness plan (Plan). The amount of relief available to a
borrower under the Plan depends on various criteria, including the
borrower’s income and the type of loan the borrower
holds.

															Before the Plan took effect, however, various
plaintiffs—including respondents here—sued to enjoin
it. Respondents are two individual borrowers who, for different
reasons, do not qualify for the maximum relief available under the
Plan. They argue that the Department of Education promulgated the
Plan without following mandatory procedures known as (1) negotiated
rulemaking and (2) notice and comment. The District Court held in
favor of respondents, and we granted certiorari before judgment to
consider this case alongside Biden v. Nebraska,
No. 22–506, which presents a similar challenge to the
Plan.

															Ultimately, however, we do not resolve
respondents’ procedural claim because we conclude that they
lack standing to bring it. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas
and remand with instructions to dismiss. We simultaneously deny as
moot the Department’s application for a stay pending
appeal.

															I

															A

															The Court’s opinion in Biden v.
Nebraska, ___ U. S. ___ (2023), recounts the relevant
background of the HEROES Act, so only a brief summary is provided
here. The Act authorizes the Secretary of Education “to waive
or modify any provision” applicable to federal “student
financial assistance” programs “as may be necessary to
ensure that . . . recipients of student financial
assistance” who live or work in a declared disaster area, or
suffer direct economic hardship as a result of a national
emergency, “are not placed in a worse position financially in
relation to that financial assistance because” of the
disaster or emergency. 20 U. S. C.
§§1098bb(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), 1098ee(2)(C)–(D).

															In addition to this substantive grant of
authority, the HEROES Act dispenses with certain procedural rules
for actions taken pursuant to it.

															First, the HEROES Act permits the Secretary to
implement any “waivers and modifications authorized or
required” by the Act without engaging in the
“negotiated rulemaking” that is typically required
before proposing regulations relating to student financial
assistance. §1098bb(d). Negotiated rulemaking is a lengthy
deliberative process involving many stakeholders. Pursuant to this
process, the Secretary must first obtain “advice of and
recommendations” from a long list of sources, including
“individuals and representatives” of groups “such
as students, legal assistance organizations that represent
students, institutions of higher education, State student grant
agencies, guaranty agencies, lenders, secondary markets, loan
servicers, guaranty agency servicers, and collection
agencies.” §1098a(a)(1). Then, informed by this
consultation, the Secretary must submit draft regulations for
consideration in a negotiation process involving participants who
are “chosen by the Secretary from individuals nominated
by” such groups. §1098a(b)(1). Only after taking these
steps may the Secretary “publis[h] proposed regulations in
the Federal Register,” ibid., accompanied by a summary
of the information the Secretary received throughout the process,
§1098a(a)(2). The HEROES Act, however, permits the Secretary
to bypass this onerous process. §1098bb(d).

															The HEROES Act also authorizes the Secretary to
bypass notice-and-comment procedures that the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA) would otherwise demand. The APA typically
requires agencies to give the public “[g]eneral notice of [a]
proposed rule making” by publication in the Federal Register,
and then to provide “interested persons an opportunity to
participate in the rule making through submission of written data,
views, or arguments” regarding the proposed rule. 5
U. S. C. §§553(b), (c). The agency may
promulgate a final rule only after providing notice and opportunity
for comment. §553(c). But the HEROES Act instead permits the
Secretary to implement the waivers and modifications he
“deems necessary to achieve the purposes of ” the
Act merely by “publish[ing]” “notice in the
Federal Register.” 20 U. S. C.
§1098bb(b)(1).

															B

															On September 27, 2022, Secretary of Education
Miguel Cardona, invoking authority under the HEROES Act, directed
the issuance of waivers and modifications that would bring about
the forgiveness of a substantial amount of student-loan debt. In
particular, he purported to effect the discharge of (1) $10,000 of
eligible, federally held student-loan debt for any individual
borrower with 2020 or 2021 income under $125,000 (or household
income under $250,000), and (2) an additional $10,000 (making a
total of $20,000) for any such borrower who had ever received a
Pell Grant. Pell Grants are Government-funded grants to help defray
the cost of postsecondary education; eligibility for these grants
turns principally on the income of a student’s family when
the student applies to and is enrolled in the relevant educational
program (almost always undergraduate study). See
§§1070a(b)(2), 1087mm(a), 1091; see also 34 CFR
§690.6(c) (2022) (limited eligibility for students in a
qualifying “postbaccalaureate program”). Secretary
Cardona directed that these actions be taken via a publication in
the Federal Register, see App. 262; all agree that he did not
observe the generally applicable negotiated-rulemaking or
notice-and-comment processes in devising and announcing the
Plan.

															Notwithstanding the Plan’s scope and
expense, not all student-loan borrowers were pleased with it. Myra
Brown and Alexander Taylor, plaintiffs in this case, are two such
dissatisfied borrowers, albeit for different reasons. Brown’s
loans are “commercially held,” id., at 171,
Complaint ¶10, meaning that her creditor is an entity other
than the Federal Government. The Plan, however, applies only to
borrowers whose loans fall into one or more categories of loans
“held by the Department.” 87 Fed. Reg. 61513 (2022).
Consequently, Brown is not entitled to any loan forgiveness under
the Plan.

															Taylor, on the other hand, is eligible for loan
forgiveness—but only $10,000, rather than the maximum
$20,000. That is because, despite now having an annual income of
less than $25,000, he never received a Pell Grant. See App. 183,
Complaint ¶61. Thus, individuals with annual income up to five
times greater than his are eligible for twice as much loan
forgiveness as he is if they ever received a Pell Grant.

															Accordingly, both Brown and Taylor object to
certain elements of the Plan—Brown to its limitation to
federally held loans, and Taylor to the additional relief it doles
out based on prior Pell Grants, with no regard for current income.
Because the Department did not engage in negotiated rulemaking or
notice and comment, however, Brown and Taylor had no formal
opportunity to voice their views on the Plan prior to its
adoption.

															Alleging that the law entitles them to such an
opportunity, Brown and Taylor brought this action in the U. S.
District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Their one-count
complaint claims that the Plan is unlawful because the Department
promulgated it without observing the requirements of negotiated
rulemaking and notice and comment. As a result, they claim, we
should “[v]acate and set aside the” Plan under 5
U. S. C. §706(2)(D). App. 186.

															Brown and Taylor recognize that the HEROES Act
supplies exemptions from these procedural requirements. They argue,
however, that an action of the Secretary falls within these
exemptions only if it is substantively authorized by the Act; the
Secretary, in their view, cannot merely invoke the “HEROES
Act” to bypass negotiated rulemaking and notice and comment.
According to Brown and Taylor, the Act does not substantively
authorize the Plan, and so the Secretary was required to follow
these procedures.

															The District Court agreed with Brown and
Taylor—in part. It rebuffed their central argument that the
HEROES Act exempts from procedural requirements only those actions
that the Act substantively authorizes. But the District Court
nonetheless held that the Plan exceeds the Secretary’s
authority under the HEROES Act and therefore entered judgment
vacating it. ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, ___, 2022 WL 16858525, *15
(ND Tex., Nov. 10, 2022).

															After the Fifth Circuit denied the
Department’s motion for a stay pending appeal, the Department
applied to this Court for such a stay. The Department advised in
the alternative that we could treat its application as a petition
for certiorari before judgment. We did just that, granting the
Department’s petition for certiorari before judgment and
deferring consideration of its application for a stay. 598
U. S. ___ (2022). We now review the judgment in No.
22–535 and dispose of the pending application in No.
22A489.

															II

															We ultimately do not address Brown and
Taylor’s argument that the Department failed to observe
proper procedures in promulgating the Plan. “We have
‘an obligation to assure ourselves’ of litigants’
standing under Article III” before proceeding to the merits
of a case. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S.
332, 340 (2006) (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.
Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S.
167, 180 (2000)). And because we conclude that Brown and Taylor
lack standing, “[t]his case begins and ends with
standing.” Carney v. Adams, 592 U. S. ___,
___ (2020) (slip op., at 4). In particular, we hold that Brown and
Taylor fail to establish that any injury they suffer from not
having their loans forgiven is fairly traceable to the Plan.

															A

															Our authority under the Constitution is
limited to resolving “Cases” or
“Controversies.” Art. III, §2. “The
doctrine of standing,” among others, “implements
this” limit on our authority. Carney, 592 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 4). Our jurisprudence has “established
that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains
three elements” that a plaintiff must plead
and—ultimately—prove. Lujan v. Defenders of
Wildlife, 504 U.S.
555, 560 (1992). “First, the plaintiff must have suffered
an ‘injury in fact’ ” that is both
“concrete and particularized” and “actual or
imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” Ibid.
(some internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the
plaintiff ’s injury must be “fairly traceable to
the challenged action of the defendant,” meaning that
“there must be a causal connection between the injury and the
conduct complained of.” Ibid. (internal quotation
marks and alterations omitted). “Third, it must be
‘likely,’ as opposed to merely
‘speculative,’ that the injury will be redressed by a
favorable decision.” Id., at 561 (some internal
quotation marks omitted).

															We have found, however, that when a statute
affords a litigant “a procedural right to protect his
concrete interests,” the litigant may establish Article III
jurisdiction without meeting the usual “standards for
redressability and immediacy.” Id., at 572, n. 7.
For example, we hypothesized a person “living adjacent to the
site for proposed construction of a federally licensed dam”
and explained that this person “has standing to challenge the
licensing agency’s failure to prepare an environmental impact
statement, even though he cannot establish with any certainty that
the statement will cause the license to be withheld or
altered.” Ibid. In this context, the fact that the
defendant might well come to the same decision after abiding by the
contested procedural requirement does not deprive a plaintiff of
standing.

															Regardless of the redressability showing we have
tolerated in the procedural-rights context, we have never held a
litigant who asserts such a right is excused from demonstrating
that it has a “concrete interest that is affected by the
deprivation” of the claimed right. Summers v. Earth
Island Institute, 555 U.S.
488, 496–497 (2009).

															We emphasized this requirement in
Summers, where we were asked to review U. S. Forest
Service regulations exempting certain minor land-management
decisions from the typical notice-and-comment process. Id.,
at 490–491. The plaintiffs in that case did not have any
“concrete plans to observe nature in [a] specific area”
affected by actions the Service took pursuant to this exemption,
id., at 497, and we therefore held that they lacked
standing, id., at 494–497. As we put it, the
“deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete
interest that is affected by the deprivation—a procedural
right in vacuo—is insufficient to create Article III
standing.” Id., at 496.

															B

															Before applying this framework, we pause to
explain both respondents’ theory of standing and the
substance of their claim, which have not always been readily
ascertainable—or consistently described—during this
litigation.

															Upon initial inspection, respondents’
merits theory appears to be in tension with the possibility that
the Department could redress their injury. Respondents argue
simultaneously (1) that the Department might have treated them more
generously if it had solicited their input in developing the Plan
and (2) that the Department lacks substantive authority to
promulgate broad-based loan forgiveness under the HEROES Act. It
would be quite odd for Brown and Taylor to complain about being
unable to seek an increase in the scope of an administrative action
that they think the Department cannot lawfully take.

															Respondents belatedly attempted to address this
strange feature of their argument. Their complaint does not say a
word about standing. But in their reply supporting their motion in
the District Court for an injunction against the Plan, they
ventured a brief attempt to explain their position on this
threshold issue. They insisted that the Department cannot adopt the
Plan under the HEROES Act regardless of the procedures it follows.
Reply in No. 4:22–cv–908 (ND Tex., Oct. 20, 2022),
ECF Doc. 26, pp. 3–4. But they observed that the
Department has claimed it also has authority to forgive loans under
a different statute, the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), which
authorizes the Secretary to “compromise, waive, or release
any right, title, claim, lien, or demand.” 20
U. S. C. §1082(a)(6). Thus, respondents argued,
there is a chance that vacating the Plan would prompt the
Department to pursue loan relief under the HEA instead. In this
Court, Brown and Taylor discuss the HEA at length for the first
time in this litigation. See Brief for Respondents 28–32.

															Having recounted this history, we now understand
respondents’ claim and theory of standing as follows. First,
because the HEROES Act does not substantively authorize the Plan,
the Department was obligated to follow the typical
negotiated-rulemaking and notice-and-comment requirements. Second,
if the Department had observed those procedures, respondents might
have used those opportunities to convince the Department
(1) that proceeding under the HEROES Act is unlawful or
otherwise undesirable, and (2) that it should adopt a
different loan-forgiveness plan under the HEA instead, one that is
more generous to them than the HEROES Act plan that they allege is
unlawful. They assert there is at least a chance that this series
of events will come to pass now if we vacate the Plan.
Id., at 19.

															C

															Describing respondents’ claim illustrates
how unusual it is. They claim they are injured because the
Government has not adopted a lawful benefits program under which
they would qualify for assistance. But the same could be said of
anyone who might benefit from a benefits program that the
Government has not chosen to adopt. It is difficult to see how such
an injury could be particular (since all people suffer it) or
concrete (since an as-yet-uncreated benefits plan is necessarily
“ ‘abstract’ ” and not
“ ‘real’ ”).[1] Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S.
330, 340 (2016); see also Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S.
737, 755–756 (1984) (rejecting a theory that would
“extend [standing] nationwide”). Nor have we ever
accepted that an injury is redressable when the prospect of redress
turns on the Government’s wholly discretionary decision to
create a new regulatory or benefits program.

															Nonetheless, we think the deficiencies of
respondents’ claim are clearest with respect to traceability.
They cannot show that their purported injury of not receiving loan
relief under the HEA is fairly traceable to the Department’s
(allegedly unlawful) decision to grant loan relief under the HEROES
Act.

															1

															At the outset, we reiterate what
respondents’ claim is not. Respondents are not claiming that
they are injured by not being included in the Plan (or, in
Taylor’s case, by being remunerated by the Plan less
generously than he thinks himself entitled to). After all, they
think the Plan is substantively unlawful, a merits contention that
“we accept as valid” for purposes of analyzing
standing. Federal Election Comm’n v. Ted
Cruz for Senate, 596 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op.,
at 6). It would be quite strange to think that a party experiences
an Article III injury by not being affected by an unlawful
action (in Brown’s case) or not being more affected by
such action (in Taylor’s).

															Instead, respondents seek relief under a
separate statutory source. They name the HEA as that potential
source, but presumably they would be pleased for the Department to
invoke any other lawful source (if one exists) as grounds for
granting them loan relief. Their interest is in obtaining loan
forgiveness in general.

															The Plan, however, is independent of any
student-loan relief the Department might craft under the HEA (or
any other statute). A decision by this Court that the Plan is
lawful would have no effect on the Department’s ability to
forgive respondents’ loans under the HEA.[2] Thus, the Plan poses no legal obstacle to the
Department’s choosing to find other ways to remedy the harm
respondents experience from not having their loans forgiven.

															Put differently, the Department’s decision
to give other people relief under a different
statutory scheme did not cause respondents not to obtain the
benefits they want. The cause of their supposed injury is far more
pedestrian than that: The Department has simply chosen not
to give them the relief they want. Ordinarily, a party’s
recourse to induce an agency to take a desired action is to file
not a lawsuit, but a “petition for the issuance, amendment,
or repeal of a rule.” 5 U. S. C. §553(e). The
denial of such a petition “must be justified by a statement
of reasons,” which in turn “can be appealed to the
courts” if the litigant has standing to maintain such a suit.
Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S.
452, 459 (1997). Contesting a separate benefits program based
on a theory that it crowds out the desired one, however, is an
approach for which we have been unable to find any precedent.

															It is true that in procedural-standing cases, we
tolerate uncertainty over whether observing certain procedures
would have led to (caused) a different substantive outcome, as with
Lujan’s example of the dam and the bypassed
environmental impact statement. See 504 U. S., at 572,
n. 7. In this case, however, the causal uncertainty is not
merely over whether observing certain procedures would have led to
a different substantive outcome. Instead, the uncertainty concerns
whether the substantive decisions the Department has made
regarding the Plan under the HEROES Act have a causal relationship
with other substantive decisions respondents want the
Department to make under the HEA. There is no precedent for
tolerating this sort of causal uncertainty.

															Our other procedural-standing cases demonstrate
the point. In the example posited in Lujan, proceeding with
building the dam as planned and simultaneously sparing the adjacent
landowner from the negative effects of the dam are mutually
exclusive options. See ibid. While it might be uncertain
whether undertaking an environmental impact statement would prevent
the dam from being built, it is clear that building the dam would
directly injure the landowner.

															Similarly, in a case like Summers, it
might be uncertain whether public comment would alter any
particular land-management decision the Forest Service makes. There
would be no uncertainty, however, that a plaintiff with concrete
plans to observe nature in a particular area “would be harmed
if the [land-management project] went forward without incorporation
of the ideas he would have suggested” in his comments. 555
U. S., at 494.[3]

															Accordingly, Brown and Taylor need not allege
that observing negotiated rulemaking and notice and comment would
“ ‘force’ ” the Department to
reach substantive results more favorable to them than those
embodied in the Plan. Lemon v. Geren, 514 F.3d 1312,
1314–1315 (CADC 2008). But they must still
show—pursuant to our customary traceability
standards—that the Plan’s substance causes their injury
by impairing loan relief under the HEA.

															Brown and Taylor cannot meet this standard.
“It is purely speculative whether the denia[l]” of HEA
loan relief—their ostensible injury—“fairly can
be traced to” the Department’s decision to grant loan
relief in the Plan. Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights
Organization, 426 U.S.
26, 42–43 (1976); see also Warth v. Seldin,
422 U.S.
490, 503–504 (1975).

															As noted above, HEROES Act loan relief and HEA
loan relief function independently of each other. If the Department
may lawfully grant loan relief under both the HEROES Act and the
HEA, it is entitled to choose to do both, neither, or only one
(provided that it sufficiently explains its reasoning, see 5
U. S. C. §706(2)(A)). There is little reason to
think that its discretionary decision to pursue one mechanism of
loan relief has anything to do with its discretionary decision to
pursue (or not pursue) another. “The line of causation
between” the Department’s promulgation of the Plan and
respondents’ lack of benefits under the HEA “is
attenuated at best,” Allen, 468 U. S., at 757,
and all too dependent on
“ ‘conjecture,’ ” Summers,
555 U. S., at 496.

															2

															Respondents’ attempts to tie the Plan to
potential HEA relief are unavailing. They point to a handful of
documents related to the Plan that say that the Department is
providing “one-time” student-loan relief. See,
e.g., App. 215, 221, 225. Such statements, Brown and Taylor
argue, show that the decision to grant loan relief under the HEROES
Act foreclosed HEA relief.

															This is insufficient. The Plan itself—the
action under review here—contains no reference to
“one-time” relief. See 87 Fed. Reg. 61512–61514.
And to the extent that the Department’s decision to adopt the
Plan under the HEROES Act might have some incidental effect on the
likelihood that the Department will undertake a separate
loan-forgiveness program under a different statute, the
relationship is not sufficiently close to persuade us that the
latter is fairly traceable to the former. See, e.g.,
Simon, 426 U. S., at 42–43 (accepting that
certain tax rules might
“ ‘encourag[e]’ ” or
“ ‘discourage’ ” particular
behavior, but nonetheless holding that connection to be
insufficient to establish standing where it was “just as
plausible” that actors would “forgo favorable tax
treatment”). Moreover, no one argues that the existing
references to one-time relief are legally binding. To whatever
extent the Department has determined that the Plan crowds out other
efforts to forgive student loans, that, too, is a discretionary and
independent decision that respondents may ask it to reconsider with
a §553(e) petition.

															Finally, Brown and Taylor also argue that they
have demonstrated causation because the Secretary’s failure
to observe the requisite procedural rules cost them a
“ ‘chance’ ” to “obtain
debt forgiveness.” Brief for Respondents 28. But referring in
the abstract to a “chance” of obtaining “debt
forgiveness” does not solve their problem. They do not want
debt forgiveness under the HEROES Act, which they claim is
unlawful. They want debt forgiveness under the HEA. Nothing the
Secretary has done deprives them of a “chance” to seek
that result.

															Because respondents cannot meaningfully connect
the absence of loan relief under the HEA to the adoption of the
Plan, they have failed to show that their injury is fairly
traceable to the Plan.

															*  *  *

															For these reasons, respondents lack standing,
and we therefore vacate the judgment of the District Court and
remand the case with instructions to dismiss. By vacating the
District Court’s judgment, we obviate the need to grant the
interim relief the Department requests in its application in No.
22A489. We therefore deny the application as moot.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 In contrast, a claim of
unlawful exclusion from an existing benefits program can be fit for
judicial resolution. See, e.g., Trinity Lutheran Church
of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449, 462
(2017).
2
 We do not opine on the
substantive lawfulness of any action the Department might take
under the HEA or add anything to our construction of the HEROES Act
as set forth in today’s opinion in
Nebraska.
3
 Although no plaintiff in
Summers had standing because none had alleged specific plans
to observe nature in one of the areas at issue in the case, see 555
U. S., at 500, the point remains that, in an equivalent case
featuring those specific plans, environmental damage to such a
plaintiff ’s esthetic interests could fairly be traced
to the Service’s land-management choices.
