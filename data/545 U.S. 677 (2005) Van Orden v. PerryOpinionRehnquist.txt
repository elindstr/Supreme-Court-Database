OPINION OF REHNQUIST, C.&NBSP;J.
VAN ORDEN V. PERRY
545 U. S. ____ (2005)

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-1500

															THOMAS VAN ORDEN, PETITIONER v. RICK
PERRY, in his official capacity as GOVERNOR OF TEXAS and CHAIRMAN,
STATE PRESERVATION BOARD, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 27, 2005]

															   Chief Justice Rehnquist announced
the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join.

															   The question here is whether the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment allows the display of a
monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the Texas State
Capitol grounds. We hold that it does.

															   The 22 acres surrounding the Texas State
Capitol contain 17 monuments and 21 historical markers
commemorating the “people, ideals, and events that compose
Texan identity.” Tex. H. Con. Res. 38, 77th Leg.
(2001).[Footnote 1] The
monolith challenged here stands 6-feet high and 3-feet wide. It is
located to the north of the Capitol building, between the Capitol
and the Supreme Court building. Its primary content is the text of
the Ten Commandments. An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye
inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be
an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten
Commandments. Below the text are two Stars of David and the
superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ. The
bottom of the monument bears the inscription “PRESENTED TO
THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF
TEXAS 1961.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 21.

															   The legislative record surrounding the
State’s acceptance of the monument from the Eagles—a
national social, civic, and patriotic organization—is limited
to legislative journal entries. After the monument was accepted,
the State selected a site for the monument based on the
recommendation of the state organization responsible for
maintaining the Capitol grounds. The Eagles paid the cost of
erecting the monument, the dedication of which was presided over by
two state legislators.

															   Petitioner Thomas Van Orden is a native Texan
and a resident of Austin. At one time he was a licensed lawyer,
having graduated from Southern Methodist Law School. Van Orden
testified that, since 1995, he has encountered the Ten Commandments
monument during his frequent visits to the Capitol grounds. His
visits are typically for the purpose of using the law library in
the Supreme Court building, which is located just northwest of the
Capitol building.

															   Forty years after the monument’s
erection and six years after Van Orden began to encounter the
monument frequently, he sued numerous state officials in their
official capacities under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C.
§1983, seeking both a declaration that the monument’s
placement violates the Establishment Clause and an injunction
requiring its removal. After a bench trial, the District Court held
that the monument did not contravene the Establishment Clause. It
found that the State had a valid secular purpose in recognizing and
commending the Eagles for their efforts to reduce juvenile
delinquency. The District Court also determined that a reasonable
observer, mindful of the history, purpose, and context, would not
conclude that this passive monument conveyed the message that the
State was seeking to endorse religion. The Court of Appeals
affirmed the District Court’s holdings with respect to the
monument’s purpose and effect. 351 F. 3d 173 (CA5 2003).
We granted certiorari, 543 U. S. ___ (2004), and now affirm.

															   Our cases, Januslike, point in two directions
in applying the Establishment Clause. One face looks toward the
strong role played by religion and religious traditions throughout
our Nation’s history. As we observed in School Dist. of
Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963):

															   “It is true that religion
has been closely identified with our history and
government… . The fact that the Founding Fathers
believed devotedly that there was a God and that the unalienable
rights of man were rooted in Him is clearly evidenced in their
writings, from the Mayflower Compact to the Constitution
itself… . It can be truly said, therefore, that today,
as in the beginning, our national life reflects a religious people
who, in the words of Madison, are ‘earnestly praying, as
… in duty bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver of the Universe
… guide them into every measure which may be worthy of his
[blessing … .]’ ” Id., at
212–213.[Footnote 2]

															The other face looks toward the principle that
governmental intervention in religious matters can itself endanger
religious freedom.

															   This case, like all Establishment Clause
challenges, presents us with the difficulty of respecting both
faces. Our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being, yet these
institutions must not press religious observances upon their
citizens. One face looks to the past in acknowledgment of our
Nation’s heritage, while the other looks to the present in
demanding a separation between church and state. Reconciling these
two faces requires that we neither abdicate our responsibility to
maintain a division between church and state nor evince a hostility
to religion by disabling the government from in some ways
recognizing our religious heritage:

															“When the state encourages religious
instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting
the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, it follows the
best of our traditions. For it then respects the religious nature
of our people and accommodates the public service to their
spiritual needs. To hold that it may not would be to find in the
Constitution a requirement that the government show a callous
indifference to religious groups… . [W]e find no
constitutional requirement which makes it necessary for government
to be hostile to religion and to throw its weight against efforts
to widen the effective scope of religious influence.”
Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 313–314
(1952).

															See also Rosenberger v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 845–846 (1995)
(warning against the “risk [of] fostering a pervasive bias or
hostility to religion, which could undermine the very neutrality
the Establishment Clause requires”).[Footnote 3]

															   These two faces are evident in representative
cases both upholding[Footnote
4] and invalidating[Footnote
5] laws under the Establishment Clause. Over the last 25 years,
we have sometimes pointed to Lemon v. Kurtzman,
403 U. S. 602
(1971), as providing the governing test in Establishment Clause
challenges.[Footnote 6] Compare
Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 (1985) (applying
Lemon), with Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983) (not applying
Lemon). Yet, just two years after Lemon was
decided, we noted that the factors identified in Lemon
serve as “no more than helpful signposts.”
Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 741
(1973). Many of our recent cases simply have not applied the
Lemon test. See, e.g., Zelman v.
Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639 (2002); Good News
Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98 (2001). Others have
applied it only after concluding that the challenged practice was
invalid under a different Establishment Clause test.

															   Whatever may be the fate of the Lemon
test in the larger scheme of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, we
think it not useful in dealing with the sort of passive monument
that Texas has erected on its Capitol grounds. Instead, our
analysis is driven both by the nature of the monument and by our
Nation’s history.

															   As we explained in Lynch v.
Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668 (1984): “There is
an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three
branches of government of the role of religion in American life
from at least 1789.” Id., at 674. For example, both
Houses passed resolutions in 1789 asking President George
Washington to issue a Thanksgiving Day Proclamation to
“recommend to the people of the United States a day of public
thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging, with
grateful hearts, the many and signal favors of Almighty God.”
1 Annals of Cong. 90, 914. President Washington’s
proclamation directly attributed to the Supreme Being the
foundations and successes of our young Nation:

															   “Now, therefore, I do
recommend and assign Thursday, the 26th day of November next, to be
devoted by the people of these States to the service of that great
and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good
that was, that is, or that will be; that we may then all unite in
rendering unto Him our sincere and humble thanks for His kind care
and protection of the people of this country previous to their
becoming a nation; for the signal and manifold mercies and the
favorable interpositions of His providence in the course and
conclusion of the late war; for the great degree of tranquillity,
union, and plenty which we have since enjoyed; for the peaceable
and rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish
constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and
particularly the national one now lately instituted; for the civil
and religious liberty with which we are blessed, and the means we
have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and, in general,
for all the great and various favors which He has been pleased to
confer upon us.” 1 J. Richardson, Messages and Papers of the
Presidents, 1789–1897, p. 64 (1899).

															   Recognition of the role of God in
our Nation’s heritage has also been reflected in our
decisions. We have acknowledged, for example, that “religion
has been closely identified with our history and government,”
School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374
U. S., at 212, and that “[t]he history of man is inseparable
from the history of religion,” Engel v.
Vitale, 370
U. S. 421, 434 (1962).[Footnote
7] This recognition has led us to hold that the Establishment
Clause permits a state legislature to open its daily sessions with
a prayer by a chaplain paid by the State. Marsh v.
Chambers, 463 U. S., at 792.[Footnote 8] Such a practice, we thought, was “deeply
embedded in the history and tradition of this country.”
Id., at 786. As we observed there, “it would be
incongruous to interpret [the Establishment Clause] as imposing
more stringent First Amendment limits on the states than the
draftsmen imposed on the Federal Government.” Id.,
at 790–791. With similar reasoning, we have upheld laws,
which originated from one of the Ten Commandments, that prohibited
the sale of merchandise on Sunday. McGowan v.
Maryland, 366 U. S. 420,
431–440 (1961); see id., at 470–488 (separate
opinion of Frankfurter, J.).

															   In this case we are faced with a display of
the Ten Commandments on government property outside the Texas State
Capitol. Such acknowledgments of the role played by the Ten
Commandments in our Nation’s heritage are common throughout
America. We need only look within our own Courtroom. Since 1935,
Moses has stood, holding two tablets that reveal portions of the
Ten Commandments written in Hebrew, among other lawgivers in the
south frieze. Representations of the Ten Commandments adorn the
metal gates lining the north and south sides of the Courtroom as
well as the doors leading into the Courtroom. Moses also sits on
the exterior east facade of the building holding the Ten
Commandments tablets.

															   Similar acknowledgments can be seen throughout
a visitor’s tour of our Nation’s Capital. For example,
a large statue of Moses holding the Ten Commandments, alongside a
statue of the Apostle Paul, has overlooked the rotunda of the
Library of Congress’ Jefferson Building since 1897. And the
Jefferson Building’s Great Reading Room contains a sculpture
of a woman beside the Ten Commandments with a quote above her from
the Old Testament (Micah 6:8). A medallion with two tablets
depicting the Ten Commandments decorates the floor of the National
Archives. Inside the Department of Justice, a statue entitled
“The Spirit of Law” has two tablets representing the
Ten Commandments lying at its feet. In front of the Ronald Reagan
Building is another sculpture that includes a depiction of the Ten
Commandments. So too a 24-foot-tall sculpture, depicting, among
other things, the Ten Commandments and a cross, stands outside the
federal courthouse that houses both the Court of Appeals and the
District Court for the District of Columbia. Moses is also
prominently featured in the Chamber of the United States House of
Representatives.[Footnote
9]

															   Our opinions, like our building, have
recognized the role the Decalogue plays in America’s
heritage. See, e.g., McGowan v.
Maryland, 366 U. S., at 442; id., at 462
(separate opinion of Frankfurter, J.).[Footnote 10] The Executive and Legislative Branches
have also acknowledged the historical role of the Ten Commandments.
See, e.g., Public Papers of the Presidents, Harry S.
Truman, 1950, p. 157 (1965); S. Con. Res. 13, 105th Cong., 1st
Sess. (1997); H. Con. Res. 31, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997). These
displays and recognitions of the Ten Commandments bespeak the rich
American tradition of religious acknowledgments.

															   Of course, the Ten Commandments are
religious—they were so viewed at their inception and so
remain. The monument, therefore, has religious significance.
According to Judeo-Christian belief, the Ten Commandments were
given to Moses by God on Mt. Sinai. But Moses was a lawgiver as
well as a religious leader. And the Ten Commandments have an
undeniable historical meaning, as the foregoing examples
demonstrate. Simply having religious content or promoting a message
consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of the
Establishment Clause. See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465
U. S., at 680, 687; Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S.,
at 792; McGowan v. Maryland, supra, at
437–440; Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New
York, 397 U. S. 664, 676–678
(1970).

															   There are, of course, limits to the display of
religious messages or symbols. For example, we held
unconstitutional a Kentucky statute requiring the posting of the
Ten Commandments in every public schoolroom. Stone v.
Graham, 449 U. S. 39 (1980) (per
curiam). In the classroom context, we found that the Kentucky
statute had an improper and plainly religious purpose.
Id., at 41. As evidenced by Stone’s almost
exclusive reliance upon two of our school prayer cases,
id., at 41–42 (citing School Dist. of Abington
Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963), and
Engel v. Vitale, 370
U. S. 421 (1962)), it stands as an example of the fact that we
have “been particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance
with the Establishment Clause in elementary and secondary
schools,” Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 583–584 (1987).
Compare Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 596–597 (1992)
(holding unconstitutional a prayer at a secondary school
graduation), with Marsh v. Chambers, supra
(upholding a prayer in the state legislature). Indeed,
Edwards v. Aguillard recognized that
Stone—along with Schempp and
Engel—was a consequence of the “particular
concerns that arise in the context of public elementary and
secondary schools.” 482 U. S., at 584–585. Neither
Stone itself nor subsequent opinions have indicated that
Stone’s holding would extend to a legislative
chamber, see Marsh v. Chambers, supra, or to
capitol grounds.[Footnote
11]

															   The placement of the Ten Commandments monument
on the Texas State Capitol grounds is a far more passive use of
those texts than was the case in Stone, where the text
confronted elementary school students every day. Indeed, Van Orden,
the petitioner here, apparently walked by the monument for a number
of years before bringing this lawsuit. The monument is therefore
also quite different from the prayers involved in Schempp
and Lee v. Weisman. Texas has treated her Capitol
grounds monuments as representing the several strands in the
State’s political and legal history. The inclusion of the Ten
Commandments monument in this group has a dual significance,
partaking of both religion and government. We cannot say that
Texas’ display of this monument violates the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment.

															   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
affirmed.

															It is so ordered.
Footnote 1

															 The monuments are: Heroes of the Alamo,
Hood’s Brigade, Confederate Soldiers, Volunteer Fireman,
Terry’s Texas Rangers, Texas Cowboy, Spanish-American War,
Texas National Guard, Ten Commandments, Tribute to Texas School
Children, Texas Pioneer Woman, The Boy Scouts’ Statue of
Liberty Replica, Pearl Harbor Veterans, Korean War Veterans,
Soldiers of World War I, Disabled Veterans, and Texas Peace
Officers.

are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme
Being”).
Footnote 3

															 Despite Justice Stevens’ recitation of
occasional language to the contrary, post, at 4–5,
and n. 7 (dissenting opinion), we have not, and do not, adhere to
the principle that the Establishment Clause bars any and all
governmental preference for religion over irreligion. See,
e.g., Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U. S. __
(2005); Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter&nbhyph;day Saints v. Amos,
483 U. S. 327
(1987); Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668 (1984); Marsh
v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983); Walz v.
Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970). Even the
dissenters do not claim that the First Amendment’s Religion
Clauses forbid all governmental acknowledgments, preferences, or
accommodations of religion. See post, at 6 (opinion of
Stevens, J.) (recognizing that the Establishment Clause permits
some “recognition” or “acknowledgment” of
religion); post, at 5, and n. 4 (opinion of Souter,
J.) (discussing a number of permissible displays with religious
content).

allowing religious school groups to use school facilities does not
violate the Establishment Clause); Agostini v.

mandating a daily minute of silence for meditation or voluntary
prayer).
Footnote 6

															 Lemon sets out a three-prong test:
“First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose;
second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither
advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not
foster ‘an excessive government entanglement with
religion.’ ” 403 U. S., at 612–613 (citation
omitted).
Footnote 7

															 See also Elk Grove Unified School
Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 26 (2004)
(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment) (“Examples of
patriotic invocations of God and official acknowledgments of
religion’s role in our Nation’s history abound”);
id., at 35–36 (O’Connor, J., concurring in
judgment) (“It is unsurprising that a Nation founded by
religious refugees and dedicated to religious freedom should find
references to divinity in its symbols, songs, mottoes, and
oaths”); Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S., at
675 (“Our history is replete with official references to the
value and invocation of Divine guidance”).
Footnote 8

															 Indeed, we rejected the claim that an
Establishment Clause violation was presented because the prayers
had once been offered in the Judeo-Christian tradition: In
Marsh, the prayers were often explicitly Christian, but
the chaplain removed all references to Christ the year after the
suit was filed. 463 U. S., at 793–794, and n. 14.
Footnote 9

															 Other examples of monuments and buildings
reflecting the prominent role of religion abound. For example, the
Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln Memorials all contain explicit
invocations of God’s importance. The apex of the Washington
Monument is inscribed “Laus Deo,” which is translated
to mean “Praise be to God,” and multiple memorial
stones in the monument contain Biblical citations. The Jefferson
Memorial is engraved with three quotes from Jefferson that make God
a central theme. Inscribed on the wall of the Lincoln Memorial are
two of Lincoln’s most famous speeches, the Gettysburg Address
and his Second Inaugural Address. Both inscriptions include those
speeches’ extensive acknowledgments of God. The first federal
monument, which was accepted by the United States in honor of
sailors who died in Tripoli, noted the dates of the fallen sailors
as “the year of our Lord, 1804, and in the 28 year of the
independence of the United States.”
Footnote 10

															 See also Edwards v.
Aguillard, 482 U. S., at 593–594; Lynch v.
Donnelly, 465 U. S., at 677–678; id., at

v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh
Chapter, 492 U. S., at 652–653 (Stevens, J., concurring
in part and dissenting in part); Stone v. Graham,
449 U. S. 39, 45 (1980) (Rehnquist, J.,
dissenting).
Footnote 11

															 Nor does anything suggest that Stone
would extend to displays of the Ten Commandments that lack a
“plainly religious,” “pre-eminent purpose,”
id., at 41. See Edwards v. Aguillard,
supra, at 593–594 (“[Stone] did not
mean that no use could ever be made of the Ten Commandments, or
that the Ten Commandments played an exclusively religious role in
the history of Western Civilization”). Indeed, we need not
decide in this case the extent to which a primarily religious
purpose would affect our analysis because it is clear from the
record that there is no evidence of such a purpose in this
case.
