															RETIREMENT PLANS COMMITTEE OF IBM, et al., PETITIONERS v. LARRY W. JANDER, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

															[January 14, 2020]

															

															Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.

															Today’s per curiam vacates and remands so that the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit can decide whether to consider two arguments that occupied most of the briefing in this Court even though the lower courts had not addressed them.  I join the Court’s opinion with two further notes.

															First, the Court of Appeals may of course determine that under its usual rules of waiver or forfeiture, it will not consider those arguments.  The per curiam is clear that the Second Circuit is to “decide whether to entertain” the arguments in the first instance.  Ante, at 3.  If the arguments were not properly preserved, sound judicial practice points toward declining to address them.  See, e.g., Wood v. Mil- yard,

566 U.S. 463, 473 (2012) (“For good reason, appellate courts ordinarily abstain from entertaining issues that have not been raised and preserved”).  That is so, contrary to Justice Gorsuch’s suggestion, whether or not the issue will come back in the future.  See post, at 2 (concurring opinion).

															Second, if the Court of Appeals chooses to address the merits of either argument, the opening question must be whether it is consistent with this Court’s decision in Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer,

573 U.S. 409 (2014).  I cannot see how.  The petitioners argue that ERISA “imposes no duty on an ESOP fiduciary to act on insider information.”  Ante, at 3.  But Dudenhoeffer makes clear that an ESOP fiduciary at times has such a duty; the decision sets out exactly what a plaintiff must allege to state a claim that the fiduciary breached his duty of prudence by “failing to act on inside information.”  573 U. S., at 423; see id., at 428; ante, at 1.  For its part, the Government argues that (absent extraordinary circumstances) an ESOP fiduciary has only the duty to disclose inside information that the federal securities laws already impose.  See ante, at 3.  But Dudenhoeffer characterizes the relationship between ERISA’s duty of prudence and the securities laws differently.  It recognizes that a fiduciary can have no obligation to take actions “violat[ing] the securities laws” or “conflict[ing]” with their “requirements” or “objectives.”  573 U. S., at 428–429; see ante, at 1–2.  At the same time, the decision explains that when an action does not so conflict, it might fall within an ESOP fiduciary’s duty—even if the securities laws do not require it.  See 573 U. S., at 428.  The question in that conflict-free zone is whether a prudent fiduciary would think the action more likely to help than to harm the fund.  See id., at 428, 430; see ante, at 1–2.  The Government candidly acknowledges that its approach would mostly wipe out that central aspect of the Dudenhoeffer standard.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22.  That too does not accord with the decision.[1]*
Notes
1
*Justice Gorsuch essays still another argument, but it also conflicts with Dudenhoeffer.  He claims that an ESOP fiduciary can never have a duty under ERISA to make disclosures “in their capacities as corporate officers.”  Post, at 1.  But Dudenhoeffer spells out when ERISA forecloses such a duty—when making the disclosure would conflict with the requirements and objectives of the securities laws.  See 573 U. S., at 429.  Absent a conflict of that kind, there is no categorical exclusion: The question, stated once again, is whether a prudent fiduciary would think the disclosure more likely to benefit than to harm the fund.  See id., at 429–430.
