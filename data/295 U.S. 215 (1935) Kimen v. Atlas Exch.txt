															This case, which comes here on certiorari to the Appellate Court of Illinois, First District, is a companion case to Awotin v. Atlas Exchange National Bank of Chicago, ante, p.  295 U. S. 209.

As an inducement and consideration for the purchase, the respondent agreed to repurchase the bonds at their maturity at par and accrued interest.
