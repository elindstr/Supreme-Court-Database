ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT
OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
Syllabus 

															This case having been decided by the state court on the authority of its own decision in a case between the same parties which has been reversed by this Court, this judgment is also reversed on the authority of Bradley v. Lightcap, ante, p.  195 U. S. 1.

															The facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

															After the decision reported 186 Ill. 510, Mrs. Bradley filed her bill in equity in the circuit court of Fulton County, Illinois, to quiet her title to the land in controversy in the action in ejectment, and for appropriate relief.  The bill was dismissed on demurrer, and Mrs. Bradley carried the case to the Supreme Court of Illinois, which affirmed the decree below.  
															Page 195 U. S. 25
Bradley v. Lightcap, 202 Ill. 154.  Three of the members of the court dissented.  The opinion of the supreme court proceeded on the strength of the decisions in 186 Ill. 510 and 201 Ill. 511.

															As we have reversed the judgment in the prior case, this case must take the same course.

															Decree reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion in No. 243.
