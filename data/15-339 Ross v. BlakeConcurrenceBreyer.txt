															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 15–339

															MICHAEL ROSS, PETITIONER v. SHAIDON BLAKE

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 6, 2016]

															

															Justice Breyer, concurring in part.

															I join the opinion of the Court, with the exception that I described in Woodford v. Ngo,

548 U. S. 81 (2006)
.  There, I agreed that “Congress intended the term ‘exhausted’ to ‘mean what the term means in administrative law, where exhaustion means proper exhaustion.’ ”  Id., at 103 (opinion concurring in judgment).  Though that statutory term does not encompass “freewheeling” exceptions for any “ ‘special circumstanc[e],’ ” ante, at 1, it does include administrative law’s “well-established exceptions to exhaustion.”  Woodford, supra, at 103 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  I believe that such exceptions, though not necessary to the Court’s disposition of this case, may nevertheless apply where appropriate.
