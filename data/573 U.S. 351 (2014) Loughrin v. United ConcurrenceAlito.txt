															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															KEVIN LOUGHRIN, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the tenth circuit

															[June 23, 2014]

															

															     Justice Alito,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															     I agree with the
Court’s holding that 18 U. S. C. §1344(2)
requires neither intent to defraud a bank nor the creation of a
risk of financial loss to a bank, but I must write separately to
express disagreement with some dicta in the opinion of the
Court.

															     In a few passages, the
Court suggests that §1344(2) requires a mens rea of purpose.
See ante, at 4 (“[T]he clause requires that the defendant
intend ‘to obtain any of the moneys . . . or other property
owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial
institution’ ” (ellipsis in original)); ante, at
12, n. 6 (“[W]hen the defendant has the requisite intent
to acquire bank property, his presentation of a forged or altered
check to a third party satisfies §1344(2)’s
‘means’ requirement”).[1] That is incorrect.

															     Congress expressly
denoted the mens rea a defendant must have to violate
§1344(2), and it is not purpose. Instead, §1344(2)
imposes liability on “[w]hoever knowingly executes, or
attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice” to obtain bank
property. (Emphasis added.) It is hard to imagine how Congress
could have been clearer as to the mental state required for
liability.

															     The Court’s
contrary statements apparently derive from the fact that the
criminal venture that a defendant must knowingly execute or attempt
to execute must be a scheme or artifice “to obtain
. . . property owned by . . . a financial
institution.” §1344(2). A defendant must have the
purpose to obtain bank property, so the argument goes, because he
must execute a scheme the purpose of which is to obtain bank
property.

															     This argument confuses
the design of the scheme with the mens rea of the defendant. The
statute requires only that the objective of the scheme must be the
obtaining of bank property, not that the defendant must have such
an objective. Of course, in many cases a scheme’s objective
will be the same as an individual defendant’s. Where the
defendant acts alone, for instance, his objective will almost
certainly be the same as that of the scheme, and the inquiry into
the defendant’s mens rea and the scheme’s objective
will accordingly merge. But in some cases, such as those involving
large, complex criminal ventures, a given defendant’s purpose
may diverge from the scheme’s objective. For instance, a
defendant who is paid by a large ring of check forgers to present
one of their forged checks to a bank for payment has executed
“a scheme or artifice . . . to obtain” bank
property, even if he only presents the check because he is paid to
do so and personally does not care whether the forged check is
honored. That is because the objective of the scheme as a whole is
to obtain bank property, and the defendant knowingly executes that
scheme.

															     The majority reads the
word “knowingly” out of the statute. That term
“ ‘requires proof of knowledge of the facts that
constitute the offense.’ ” Dixon v. United States,
548 U. S. 1, 5 (2006) . If the majority is correct that the
language “a scheme or artifice . . . to
obtain” bank property demands that the defendant intend to
obtain bank prop-erty, then the word “knowingly” is
superfluous, because a defendant whose purpose is to obtain bank
property will always know that his purpose is to obtain bank
property. Why would Congress expressly specify a lesser mens rea
element if elsewhere in the statute it commands a greater,
subsuming one?

															     Proof that a defendant
acted knowingly very often gives rise to a reasonable inference
that the defendant also acted purposely, and therefore the
Court’s dicta may not have much practical effect. But if the
issue is presented in a future case, the Court’s statements
must be regarded as dicta. The Court’s statements that a
defendant must intend to obtain bank property to be convicted under
§1344(2) are unnecessary to its conclusion that a defendant
may be convicted under this provision without proof that he either
intended to defraud a bank or created a risk of loss to a bank.
Furthermore, as the Court makes clear, petitioner waived any
challenge to his conviction arising from an asserted statutory
requirement that he must have intended to obtain bank property. See
ante, at 4, n. 3.
