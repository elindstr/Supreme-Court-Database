															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 29, 2020]

															Justice Thomas, dissenting. 

															Today a majority of the Court perpetuates its ill-founded abortion jurisprudence by enjoining a perfectly legitimate state law and doing so without jurisdiction.  As is often the case with legal challenges to abortion regulations, this suit was brought by abortionists and abortion clinics.  Their sole claim before this Court is that Louisiana’s law violates the purported substantive due process right of a woman to abort her unborn child.  But they concede that this right does not belong to them, and they seek to vindicate no private rights of their own.  Under a proper understanding of Article III, these plaintiffs lack standing to invoke our jurisdiction.

															Despite the fact that we granted Louisiana’s petition specifically to address whether “abortion providers [can] be presumed to have third-party standing to challenge health and safety regulations on behalf of their patients,” Conditional Cross-Pet. in No. 18–1460, p. i, a majority of the Court all but ignores the question.  The plurality and The Chief Justice ultimately cast aside this jurisdictional barrier to conclude that Louisiana’s law is unconstitutional under our precedents.  But those decisions created the right to abortion out of whole cloth, without a shred of support from the Constitution’s text.  Our abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled.  Because we have neither jurisdiction nor constitutional authority to declare Louisiana’s duly enacted law unconstitutional, I respectfully dissent. 

															I

															For most of its history, this Court maintained that private parties could not bring suit to vindicate the constitutional rights of individuals who are not before the Court.  Kowalski v. Tesmer,

543 U.S. 125, 135 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring) (citing Clark v. Kansas City,

176 U.S. 114, 118 (1900)).  But in the 20th century, the Court began to deviate from this traditional rule against third-party standing.  See Truax v. Raich,

239 U.S. 33, 38–39 (1915); Pierce v. Society of Sisters,

268 U.S. 510, 535–536 (1925).  From these deviations emerged our prudential third-party standing doctrine, which allows litigants to vicariously assert the constitutional rights of others when “the party asserting the right has a ‘close’ relationship with the person who possesses the right” and “there is a ‘hindrance’ to the possessor’s ability to protect his own interests.”  Kowalski, supra, at 130 (quoting Powers v. Ohio,

499 U.S. 400, 411 (1991)).[1]

															The plurality feints toward this doctrine, claiming that third-party standing for abortionists is well settled by our precedents.  But, ultimately, it dodges the question, claiming that Louisiana’s standing challenge was waived below.  Both assertions are erroneous.  First, there is no controlling precedent that sets forth the blanket rule advocated for by plaintiffs here—i.e., abortionists may challenge health and safety regulations based solely on their role in the abortion process.  Second, I agree with Justice Alito that Louisiana did not waive its standing challenge below.  Post, at 24–25 (dissenting opinion).

															But even if there were a waiver, it would not be relevant.  Louisiana argues that the abortionists and abortion clinics lack standing under Article III to assert the putative rights of their potential clients.  No waiver, however explicit, could relieve us of our independent obligation to ensure that we have jurisdiction before addressing the merits of a case.  See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno,

547 U.S. 332, 341 (2006). And under a proper understanding of Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement, plaintiffs lack standing to invoke our jurisdiction because they assert no private rights of their own, seeking only to vindicate the putative constitutional rights of individuals not before the Court.

															A

															The Court has previously asserted that the traditional rule against third-party standing is “not constitutionally mandated, but rather stem[s] from a salutary ‘rule of self-restraint’ ” motivated by “prudential” concerns.  Craig v. Boren,

429 U.S. 190, 193 (1976) (quoting Barrows v. Jackson,

346 U.S. 249, 255 (1953)).  The plurality repeats this well-rehearsed claim, accepting its validity without question.  See ante, at 12.  But support for this assertion is shallow, to say the least, and it is inconsistent with our more recent standing precedents.

															As an initial matter, this Court has never provided a coherent explanation for why the rule against third-party standing is properly characterized as prudential.  Many cases reciting this claim rely on the Court’s decision in Barrows, which stated that the rule against third-party standing is a “rule of self-restraint” “[a]part from the jurisdictional requirement” of Article III, 346 U. S., at 255.  But Barrows provides no reasoning to support that distinction and even admits that the rule against third-party standing is “not always clearly distinguished from the constitutional limitation[s]” on standing.  Ibid.  The sole authority Barrows cites in support of the rule’s “prudential” label is a single-Justice concurrence in Ashwander v. TVA,

297 U.S. 288, 346–348 (1936) (opinion of Brandeis, J.).

															Justice Brandeis’ concurrence, however, raises more questions than it answers.  The opinion does not directly reference third-party standing.  It only obliquely refers to the concept by invoking the broader requirement that a plaintiff must “show that he is injured by [the law’s] operation.”  Id., at 347.  Justice Brandeis claims that this requirement was adopted by the Court “for its own governance in cases confessedly within its jurisdiction.”  Id., at 346.  But most of the cases he cites frame the matter in terms of the Court’s jurisdiction and authority; none of them invoke prudential justifications.  See, e.g., Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration,

179 U.S. 405, 407–410 (1900); Hendrick v. Maryland,

235 U.S. 610, 621 (1915); Massachusetts v. Mellon,

262 U.S. 447, 480 (1923).  Thus, the “prudential” label for the rule against third-party standing remains a bit of a mystery. 

															It is especially puzzling that a majority of the Court insists on continuing to treat the rule against third-party standing as prudential when our recent decision in Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.,

572 U.S. 118 (2014), questioned the validity of our prudential standing doctrine more generally.  In that case, we acknowledged that requiring a litigant who has Article III standing to also demonstrate “prudential standing” is inconsistent “with our recent reaffirmation of the principle that ‘a federal court’s “obligation” to hear and decide’ cases within its jurisdiction ‘is “virtually unflagging.” ’ ”  Id., at 125–126 (quoting Sprint Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs,

571 U.S. 69, 77 (2013)).  The Court therefore suggested that the “prudential” label for these doctrines was “inapt.”  Lexmark, 572 U. S., at 127, n. 3.  As an example, it noted that the Court previously considered the rule against generalized grievances to be “prudential” but now recognizes that rule to be a part of Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement.  Ibid.  The Court specifically questioned the prudential label for the rule against third-party standing, but because Lexmark did not involve any questions of third-party standing, the Court stated that “consideration of that doctrine’s proper place in the standing firmament [could] await another day.”  Id., at 128, n. 3.

															The Court’s previous statements on the rule against third-party standing have long suggested that the “proper place” for that rule is in Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement.  The Court has acknowledged that the traditional rule against third-party standing is “closely related to Art[icle] III concerns.”  Warth v. Seldin,

422 U.S. 490, 500 (1975).  It has repeatedly noted that the rule “is not completely separable from Art[icle] III’s requirement that a plaintiff have a sufficiently concrete interest in the outcome of [the] suit to make it a case or controversy.”  Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co.,

467 U.S. 947, 955, n. 5 (1984) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Barrows, supra, at 255 (the rule against third-party standing is “not always clearly distinguished from the constitutional limitation[s]” on standing).  Moreover, the Court has even expressly stated that the rule against third-party standing is “grounded in Art[icle] III limits on the jurisdiction of federal courts to actual cases and controversies.”  New York v. Ferber,

458 U.S. 747, 767, n. 20 (1982). 

															And most recently, in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U. S. ___ (2016), the Court appeared to incorporate the rule against third-party standing into its understanding of Article III’s injury-in-fact requirement.  There, the Court stated that to establish an injury-in-fact a plaintiff must “show that he or she suffered ‘an invasion of a legally protected interest’ that is ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.’ ”  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,

504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)).  The Court further explained that whether a plaintiff “alleges that [the defendant] violated his statutory rights ” rather than “the statutory rights of other people ” was a question of “particularization” for an Article III injury.  578 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is hard to reconcile this language in Spokeo with the plurality’s assertion that third-party standing is permitted under Article III.

															B

															A brief historical examination of Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement confirms what our recent decisions suggest: The rule against third-party standing is constitutional, not prudential.  The judicial power is limited to “ ‘ “cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, the judicial process.” ’ ”  Id., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1) (quoting Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens,

529 U.S. 765, 774 (2000)); see also Muskrat v. United States,

219 U.S. 346, 356–357 (1911).  Thus, to ascertain the scope of Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement, “we must ‘refer directly to the traditional, fundamental limitations upon the powers of common-law courts.’ ”  Spokeo, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2) (quoting Honig v. Doe,

484 U.S. 305, 340 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).  “One focus” of these traditional limitations was “on the particular parties before the court, and whether the rights that they [were] invoking [were] really theirs to control.”  Woolhandler & Nelson, Does History Defeat Standing Doctrine? 102 Mich. L. Rev. 689, 732 (2004).  An examination of these limitations reveals that a plaintiff could not establish a case or controversy by asserting the constitutional rights of others.

															The limitations imposed on suits at common law varied based on the type of right the plaintiff sought to vindicate.  Spokeo, 578 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2). The rights adjudicated by common-law courts generally fell into one of two categories: public or private.  Public rights are those “owed ‘to the whole community . . . in its social aggregate capacity.’ ”  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *5).  Private rights, on the other hand, are those “ ‘belonging to individuals, considered as individuals.’ ” Spokeo, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2) (quoting 3 Blackstone, Commentaries *2).

															When a plaintiff sought to vindicate a private right, “courts historically presumed that the plaintiff suffered a de facto injury merely from having his personal, legal rights invaded.”  Spokeo, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  But a plaintiff generally “need[ed] to have a private interest of his or her own to litigate; otherwise, no sufficient interest [was] at stake on the plaintiff’s side, and the clash of interests necessary for a ‘Case’ or ‘Controversy’ [did] not exist.”  Woolhandler & Nelson, supra, at 723.  Thus, 19th-century judges uniformly refused to “listen to an objection made to the constitutionality of an act by a party whose rights” were not at issue.  Clark, 176 U. S., at 118 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., Tyler, 179 U. S., at 406–407; Supervisors v. Stanley,

105 U.S. 305, 311 (1882); United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40, 51–52 (1852); Owings v. Norwood’s Lessee, 5 Cranch 344, 348 (1809) (Marshall, C. J.); In re Wellington, 33 Mass. 87, 96 (1834) (Shaw, C. J.).[2] 

															Moreover, it was not enough for a plaintiff to allege damnum—i.e., real-world damages or practical injury—if the law he was challenging did not violate a legally protected interest of his own.  At common law, this sort of “factual harm without a legal injury was damnum absque injuria and provided no basis for relief.”  Hessick, Standing, Injury in Fact, and Private Rights, 93 Cornell L. Rev. 275, 280–281 (2008).  As Justice Dodderidge explained in 1625, “injuria & damnum are the two grounds for the having [of] all actions, and without [both of] these, no action lieth.”  Cable v. Rogers, 3 Bulst. 311, 312, 81 Eng. Rep. 259.  In the 18th century, many common-law courts ceased requiring damnum in suits alleging violations of private rights.  See, e.g., Ashby v. White, 2 Raym. Ld. 938, 92 Eng. Rep. 126, 137 (K. B.) (Holt, C. J.), aff’d, 3 Raym. Ld. 320, 92 Eng. Rep. 710, 712 (H. L. 1703); see also Webb v. Portland Mfg. Co., 29 F. Cas. 506, 507 (No. 17,322) (CC Me. 1838) (Story, J.).  But they continued to require legal injury, adhering to the “obvious” and “ancient maxim” that one’s real-world damages alone cannot “lay the foundation of an action.”  Parker v. Griswold, 17 Conn. 288, 302–303 (1846).  Thus, a plaintiff had to assert “[a]n injury, [which,] legally speaking, consists of a wrong done to a person, or, in other words, a violation of his right.”  Id., at 302.

															This brief historical review demonstrates that third-party standing is inconsistent with the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.  When a private plaintiff seeks to vindicate someone else’s legal injury, he has no private right of his own genuinely at stake in the litigation.  Even if the plaintiff has suffered damages as a result of another’s legal injury, he has no standing to challenge a law that does not violate his own private rights.

															C

															Applying these principles to the case at hand, plaintiffs lack standing under Article III and we, in turn, lack jurisdiction to decide these cases.  Thus, “[i]n light of th[e] ‘overriding and time-honored concern about keeping the Judiciary’s power within its proper constitutional sphere, we must put aside the natural urge to proceed directly to the merits of [an] important dispute and to “settle” it for the sake of convenience and efficiency.’ ”  Hollingsworth v. Perry,

570 U.S. 693, 704–705 (2013) (Roberts, C. J., for the Court) (quoting Raines v. Byrd,

521 U.S. 811, 820 (1997)).

															1

															Contrary to the plurality’s assertion otherwise, ante, at 16, abortionists’ standing to assert the putative rights of their clients has not been settled by our precedents.  It is true that this Court has reflexively allowed abortionists and abortion clinics to vicariously assert a woman’s putative right to abortion.  But oftentimes the Court has not so much as addressed standing in those cases.  See, e.g., Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016); Gonzales v. Carhart,

550 U.S. 124 (2007); Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.,

546 U.S. 320 (2006); Stenberg v. Carhart,

530 U.S. 914 (2000); Mazurek v. Armstrong,

520 U.S. 968 (1997) (per curiam); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,

505 U.S. 833 (1992).  And questions “merely lurk[ing] in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon,” are not “considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.”  Webster v. Fall,

266 U.S. 507, 511 (1925); see also Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party,

440 U.S. 173, 183 (1979).  Specifically, when it comes “to our own judicial power or jurisdiction, this Court has followed the lead of Chief Justice Marshall who held that this Court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not questioned and it was passed sub silentio.”  United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.,

344 U.S. 33, 38 (1952) (citing United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159 (1805) (Marshall, C. J., for the Court)).

															The first—and only—time the Court squarely addressed this question with a reasoned decision was in Singleton v. Wulff,

428 U.S. 106 (1976).[3]  In that case, a fractured Court concluded that two abortionists had standing to challenge a State’s refusal to provide Medicaid reimbursements for abortions.  Perfunctorily applying this Court’s requirements for third-party standing, Justice Blackmun, joined by three other Justices, asserted that abortionists generally had standing to litigate their clients’ rights.  Id., at 113–118 (plurality opinion).  Justice Stevens concurred on considerably narrower grounds, reasoning that the abortionists had standing because they had a financial stake in the outcome of the litigation and sought to vindicate their own constitutional rights as well.  Id., at 121 (opinion concurring in part).  Notably, Justice Stevens declined to join the plurality’s discussion of third-party standing, explaining that he was “not sure whether [that analysis] would, or should, sustain the doctors’ standing, apart from” their own legal rights and financial interests being at stake in that specific case.  Id., at 122.  The four remaining Justices dissented in part, concluding that the abortionists lacked standing to litigate the rights of their clients.  Id., at 122–131 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Because Justice Stevens’ opinion “concurred in the judgmen[t] on the narrowest grounds,” it is the controlling opinion regarding abortionists’ third-party standing.  Marks v. United States, 

430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977).[4]

															To the extent Justice Stevens’ opinion could be read as concluding that abortionists have standing to vicariously assert their clients’ rights so long as the abortionists establish standing on their own legal claims, his position has been abrogated by this Court’s more recent decisions, which have “confirm[ed] that a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press.”  DaimlerChrysler Corp., 547 U. S., at 352.  But more importantly, Justice Stevens’ opinion does not support the abortionists in these cases, because his opinion rested on case-specific facts not implicated here—namely, the fact that the abortionists would directly receive Medicaid payments from the defendant agency if they prevailed and that they asserted violations of their own constitutional rights.  In these cases, there is no dispute that the abortionists’ sole claim before this Court is that Louisiana’s law violates the purported substantive due process rights of their clients.

															2

															Under a proper understanding of Article III, plaintiffs lack standing.  As explained above, in suits seeking to vindicate private rights, the owners of those rights can establish a sufficient injury simply by asserting that their rights have been violated.  Constitutional rights are generally considered “private rights” to the extent they “ ‘ belon[g] to individuals, considered as individuals.’ ”  Spokeo, 578 U. S., at  ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3) (quoting 3 Blackstone, Commentaries *2); see also United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 8). And the purported substantive due process right to abort an unborn child is no exception—it is an individual right that is inherently personal.  After all, the Court “creat[ed the] right” based on the notion that abortion “ ‘ involv[es] the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy.’ ”  Whole Women’s Health, 579 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Casey, 505 U. S., at 851 (majority opinion)).  Because this right belongs to the woman making that choice, not to those who provide abortions, plaintiffs cannot establish a personal legal injury by asserting that this right has been violated.[5]

															The only injury asserted by plaintiffs in this suit is the possibility of facing criminal sanctions if the abortionists conduct abortions without admitting privileges in violation of the law.  See Response and Reply for Petitioners (No. 18–1460)/Cross-Respondents (No. 18–1323), p. 34.  But plaintiffs do not claim any right to provide abortions, nor do they contest that the State has authority to regulate such procedures.[6]  They have therefore demonstrated only real-world damages (or more accurately, the possibility of real-world damages), but no legal injury, or “invasion of a legally protected interest,” that belongs to them.  Spokeo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, under a proper understanding of Article III, plaintiffs lack standing and, consequently, this Court lacks jurisdiction.

															II

															Even if the plaintiffs had standing, the Court would still lack the authority to enjoin Louisiana’s law, which represents a constitutionally valid exercise of the State’s traditional police powers.  The plurality and The Chief Justice claim that the Court’s judgment is dictated by “our precedents,” particularly Whole Woman’s Health.  Ante, at 38 (plurality opinion); see also ante, at 2, 11–16 (Roberts, C. J., concurring in judgment).  For the detailed reasons explained by Justice Alito, this is not true.  Post, at 3–23 (dissenting opinion).

															But today’s decision is wrong for a far simpler reason: The Constitution does not constrain the States’ ability to regulate or even prohibit abortion.  This Court created the right to abortion based on an amorphous, unwritten right to privacy, which it grounded in the “legal fiction” of substantive due process, McDonald v. Chicago,

561 U.S. 742, 811 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  As the origins of this jurisprudence readily demonstrate, the putative right to abortion is a creation that should be undone.

															A

															The Court first conceived a free-floating constitutional right to privacy in Griswold v. Connecticut,

381 U.S. 479 (1965).  In that case, the Court declared unconstitutional a state law prohibiting the use of contraceptives, finding that it violated a married couple’s “right of privacy.”  Id., at 486.  The Court explained that this right could be found in the “penumbras” of five different Amendments to the Constitution—the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth.  Id., at 484.  Rather than explain what free speech or the quartering of troops had to do with contraception, the Court simply declared that these rights had created “zones of privacy” with their “penumbras,” which were “formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.”  Ibid.  This reasoning is as mystifying as it is baseless.

															As Justice Black observed in his dissent, this general “right of privacy” was never before considered a constitutional guarantee protecting citizens from governmental intrusion.  Id., at 508–510.  Rather, the concept was one of tort law, championed by Samuel Warren and the future Justice Louis Brandeis in their 1890 Harvard Law Review article entitled, “The Right to Privacy.”  4 Harv. L. Rev. 193.  Over 20 years after the
 
Fourteenth Amendment was ratified and a century after the Bill of Rights was adopted, Warren and Brandeis were among the first to advocate for this privacy right in the context of tort relief for those whose personal information and private affairs were exploited by others.  Id., at 193, 195–196, 214–220.  By “exalting a phrase . . . used in discussing grounds for tort relief, to the level of a constitutional rule,” the Court arrogated to itself the “power to invalidate any legislative act which [it] find[s] irrational, unreasonable[,] or offensive” as an impermissible “interfere[nce] with ‘privacy.’ ”  Griswold, supra, at 510, n. 1, 511 (Black, J., dissenting).

															Just eight years later, the Court utilized its newfound power in Roe v. Wade,

410 U.S. 113 (1973).  There, the Court struck down a Texas law restricting abortion as a violation of a woman’s constitutional “right of privacy,” which it grounded in the “concept of personal liberty” purportedly protected by the Due Process Clause of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment.  Id., at 153.  The Court began its legal analysis by openly acknowledging that the Constitution’s text does not “mention any right of privacy.”  Id., at 152.  The Court nevertheless concluded that it need not bother with our founding document’s text, because the Court’s prior decisions—chief among them Griswold—had already divined such a right from constitutional penumbras.  Roe, 410 U. S., at 152.  Without any legal explanation, the Court simply concluded that this unwritten right to privacy was “broad enough to encompass a woman’s [abortion] decision.”  Id., at 153.

															B

															Roe is grievously wrong for many reasons, but the most fundamental is that its core holding—that the Constitution protects a woman’s right to abort her unborn child—finds no support in the text of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment.  Roe suggests that the Due Process Clause’s reference to “liberty” could provide a textual basis for its novel privacy right.  Ibid.  But that Clause does not guarantee liberty qua liberty.  Rather, it expressly contemplates the deprivation of liberty and requires only that such deprivations occur through “due process of law.”  Amdt. 14, §1.  As I have previously explained, there is “ ‘considerable historical evidence support[ing] the position that “due process of law” was [originally understood as] a separation-of-powers concept . . . forbidding only deprivations not authorized by legislation or common law.’ ”  Johnson v. United States,

576 U.S. 591, 623 (2015) (opinion concurring in judgment) (quoting D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The First Hundred Years 1789–1888, p. 272 (1985)).  Others claim that the original understanding of this Clause requires that “statutes that purported to empower the other branches to deprive persons of rights without adequate procedural guarantees [be] subject to judicial review.”  Chapman & McConnell, Due Process as Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L. J. 1672, 1679 (2012).  But, whatever the precise requirements of the Due Process Clause, “the notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only ‘process’ before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the most casual user of words.”  McDonald, 561 U. S., at 811 (opinion of Thomas, J.).

															More specifically, the idea that the Framers of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment understood the Due Process Clause to protect a right to abortion is farcical.  See Roe, 410 U. S., at 174–175 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  In 1868, when the
 
Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, a majority of the States and numerous Territories had laws on the books that limited (and in many cases nearly prohibited) abortion.  See id., at 175, n. 1.[7]  It would no doubt shock the public at that time to learn that one of the new constitutional Amendments contained hidden within the interstices of its text a right to abortion.  The fact that it took this Court over a century to find that right all but proves that it was more than hidden—it simply was not (and is not) there.

															C

															Despite the readily apparent illegitimacy of Roe, “the Court has doggedly adhered to [its core holding] again and again, often to disastrous ends.”  Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 16).  In doing so, the Court has repeatedly invoked stare decisis.  See, e.g., Casey, 505 U. S., at 854–869.  And today, a majority of the Court insists that this doctrine compels its result.  See ante, at 40 (plurality opinion); ante, at 2, 11 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.).  

															The Court’s current “formulation of the stare decisis standard does not comport with our judicial duty under Article III,” which requires us to faithfully interpret the Constitution.  Gamble, 587 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  Rather, when our prior decisions clearly conflict with the text of the Constitution, we are required to “privilege [the] text over our own precedents.”  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  Because Roe and its progeny are premised on a “demonstrably erroneous interpretation of the Constitution,” we should not apply them here.  587 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 10).

															Even under The Chief Justice’s approach to stare decisis, continued adherence to these precedents cannot be justified.  Stare decisis is “not an inexorable command,” ante, at 3 (internal quotation marks omitted), and this Court has recently overruled a number of poorly reasoned precedents that have proved themselves to be unworkable, see Knick v. Township of Scott, 588 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2019) (Roberts, C. J., for the Court) (slip op., at 20–23); Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, 587 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2019) (slip op., at 16–17); Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (slip op., at 33–47).  As I have already demonstrated, supra, at 14–17, Roe’s reasoning is utterly deficient—in fact, not a single Justice today attempts to defend it.  

															Moreover, the fact that no five Justices can agree on the proper interpretation of our precedents today evinces that our abortion jurisprudence remains in a state of utter entropy.  Since the Court decided Roe, Members of this Court have decried the unworkability of our abortion case law and repeatedly called for course corrections of varying degrees.  See, e.g., 410 U. S., at 171–178 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); Doe v. Bolton,

410 U.S. 179, 221–223 (1973) (White, J., dissenting); Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,

462 U.S. 416, 452–466 (1983) (O’Connor, J., dissenting); Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,

476 U.S. 747, 785–797 (1986) (White, J., dissenting); Webster v. Reproductive Health Services,

492 U.S. 490, 532–537 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Casey, 505 U. S., at 944–966 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); id., at 979–1002 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Stenberg, 530 U. S., at 953–956 (Scalia, J., dissenting); id., at 980–983 (Thomas, J., dissenting); Whole Woman’s Health, 579 U. S., at ___–___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5–11).  In Casey, the majority claimed to clarify this “jurisprudence of doubt,” 505 U. S., at 844, but our decisions in the decades since then have only demonstrated the folly of that assertion, see Stenberg, 530 U. S., at 953–956 (Scalia, J., dissenting); id., at 960–979 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); Whole Woman’s Health, supra, at ___–___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5–11).  They serve as further evidence that this Court’s abortion jurisprudence has failed to deliver the “ ‘principled and intelligible’ ” development of the law that stare decisis purports to secure.  Ante, at 3 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.) (quoting Vasquez v. Hillery,

474 U.S. 254, 265 (1986)).  

															The Chief Justice advocates for a Burkean approach to the law that favors adherence to “ ‘the general bank and capital of nations and of ages.’ ”  Ante, at 3 (quoting 3 E. Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France 110 (1790)).  But such adherence to precedent was conspicuously absent when the Court broke new ground with its decisions in Griswold and Roe.  And no one could seriously claim that these revolutionary decisions—or Whole Woman’s Health, decided just four Terms ago—are part of the “inheritance from our forefathers,” fidelity to which demonstrates “reverence to antiquity.”  E. Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France 27–28 (J. Pocock ed. 1987).  

															More importantly, we exceed our constitutional authority whenever we “appl[y] demonstrably erroneous precedent instead of the relevant law’s text.”  Gamble, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  Because we can reconcile neither Roe nor its progeny with the text of our Constitution, those decisions should be overruled. 

															*  *  *

															Because we lack jurisdiction and our abortion jurisprudence finds no basis in the Constitution, I respectfully dissent.[8]
Notes
1
 In practice, this doctrine’s application has been unconvincing and unpredictable, which has long caused me to question its legitimacy.  See, e.g., United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2020) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6–9); Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2–5); Kowalski, 543 U. S., at 135 (Thomas, J., concurring).  For example, the Court has held that attorneys cannot bring suit to vindicate the
 
Sixth Amendment rights of their potential clients due to the lack of a current close relationship, id., at 130–131, but the Court permits defendants to seek relief based on the
 
Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights of potential jurors whom they have never met, Powers, 499 U. S., at 410–416; J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B.,

511 U.S. 127, 129 (1994).  And today, the plurality reaffirms our precedent allowing beer vendors to assert the
 
Fourteenth Amendment rights of their potential customers.  Ante, at 14 (citing Craig v. Boren,

429 U.S. 190, 192 (1976)).  But it is fair to wonder whether gun vendors could expect to receive the same privilege if they seek to vindicate the
 
Second Amendment rights of their customers.  Given this Court’s ad hoc approach to third-party standing and its tendency to treat the
 
Second Amendment as a second-class right, their time would be better spent waiting for Godot. 

2
 Common-law courts’ recognition of prochain ami or “next friend” standing is not inconsistent with this point.  In those cases, the third party was “no party to the suit in the technical sense” but rather served as “an officer of the court” and was legally “appointed by [the court] to look after the interests of [the party lacking legal capacity],” who remained the real party in interest on “whom the judgment in the action [was] consequently binding.”  Blumenthal v. Craig, 81 F. 320, 321–322 (CA3 1897) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In contrast, the real parties in interest here—women seeking abortions in Louisiana—cannot be bound by a judgment against abortionists and abortion clinics. 

3
 Although the Court concluded that the abortionists had standing to challenge the constitutionality of abortion regulations in Doe v. Bolton,

410 U.S. 179 (1973), it did so only in dicta, id., at 188–189.  The abortionists’ coplaintiffs were pregnant women whom the Court determined had standing to assert their own rights, and thus whether the abortionists had standing was “a matter of no great consequence.”  Id., at 188.  Even so, the Court only cursorily considered the question whether the threat of prosecution faced by the abortionists was a sufficiently direct injury under the Court’s then-existing standing doctrine, id., at 188–189, which was considerably more lenient than our current understanding.  The Court did not engage in any meaningful Article III analysis or refer to this Court’s third-party standing doctrine.  Ibid.; see also Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,

462 U.S. 416, 440, n. 30 (1983) (concluding without any analysis that an abortionist had standing to raise a claim on behalf of his minor patients).  And notably, the abortionists in that case had brought suit to vindicate their own constitutional rights to “practic[e] their . . . professio[n].”  Doe, supra, at 186; see also Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,

428 U.S. 52, 62 (1976) (concluding, without any analysis of Article III or the third-party standing doctrine, that abortionists had standing in a suit alleging violations of both their own constitutional rights and those of their clients). 

4
 Three Justices of this Court have recently taken the position that this rule from Marks,

430 U.S. 188, does not necessarily apply in all 4–1–4 cases, and that such decisions can sometimes produce “no controlling opinion at all.”  Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (principal opinion) (slip op., at 18).  But even under their view, Justice Blackmun’s plurality in Singleton would not be considered binding precedent. 

5
 Notably, plaintiffs point to no evidence in the record of women who seek abortions in Louisiana actually opposing this law on the ground that it violates their constitutional rights. 

6
 Although plaintiffs initially argued that Louisiana’s law also violated their procedural due process rights by requiring them to obtain admitting privileges in an unreasonably short time, App. 24, 28, they have since abandoned that claim.  And even if they had asserted violations of their own rights before this Court, those legal injuries would be insufficient to establish standing for a distinct claim based on their clients’ putative rights.  See supra, at 12.

 I agree with Justice Alito’s application of our precedents except in Part IV–F of his opinion, but I would not remand for further proceedings.  Because plaintiffs lack standing under Article III, I would instead remand with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  Alternatively, if I were to reach the merits because a majority of the Court concludes we have jurisdiction, I would affirm, as plaintiffs have failed to carry their burden of demonstrating that Act 620 is unconstitutional, even under our precedents.
