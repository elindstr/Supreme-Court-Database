															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															SHARONELL FULTON, et al., PETITIONERS v. CITY OF PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit

															[June 17, 2021]

															

															Justice Barrett, with whom Justice Kavanaugh joins, and with whom Justice Breyer joins as to all but the first paragraph, concurring.

															In Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith,

494 U.S. 872 (1990), this Court held that a neutral and generally applicable law typically does not violate the Free Exercise Clause—no matter how severely that law burdens religious exercise.  Petitioners, their amici, scholars, and Justices of this Court have made serious arguments that Smith ought to be overruled.  While history looms large in this debate, I find the historical record more silent than supportive on the question whether the founding generation understood the
 
First Amendment to require religious exemptions from generally applicable laws in at least some circumstances.  In my view, the textual and structural arguments against Smith are more compelling.  As a matter of text and structure, it is difficult to see why the Free Exercise Clause—lone among the
 
First Amendment freedoms—offers nothing more than protection from discrimination.

															Yet what should replace Smith?  The prevailing assumption seems to be that strict scrutiny would apply whenever a neutral and generally applicable law burdens religious exercise.  But I am skeptical about swapping Smith’s categorical antidiscrimination approach for an equally categorical strict scrutiny regime, particularly when this Court’s resolution of conflicts between generally applicable laws and other
 
First Amendment rights—like speech and assembly—has been much more nuanced.  There would be a number of issues to work through if Smith were overruled.  To name a few: Should entities like Catholic Social Services—which is an arm of the Catholic Church—be treated differently than individuals?  Cf. Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC,

565 U.S. 171 (2012).  Should there be a distinction between indirect and direct burdens on religious exercise?  Cf. Braunfeld v. Brown,

366 U.S. 599, 606–607 (1961) (plurality opinion).  What forms of scrutiny should apply?  Compare Sherbert v. Verner,

374 U.S. 398, 403 (1963) (assessing whether government’s interest is “ ‘compelling’ ”), with Gillette v. United States,

401 U.S. 437, 462 (1971) (assessing whether government’s interest is “substantial”).  And if the answer is strict scrutiny, would pre-Smith cases rejecting free exercise challenges to garden-variety laws come out the same way?  See Smith, 494 U. S., at 888–889.

															We need not wrestle with these questions in this case, though, because the same standard applies regardless whether Smith stays or goes.  A longstanding tenet of our free exercise jurisprudence—one that both pre-dates and survives Smith—is that a law burdening religious exercise must satisfy strict scrutiny if it gives government officials discretion to grant individualized exemptions.  See id., at 884 (law not generally applicable “where the State has in place a system of individual exemptions” (citing Sherbert, 374 U. S., at 401, n. 4)); see also Cantwell v. Connecticut,

310 U.S. 296, 303–307 (1940) (subjecting statute to heightened scrutiny because exemptions lay in discretion of government official).  As the Court’s opinion today explains, the government contract at issue provides for individualized exemptions from its nondiscrimination rule, thus triggering strict scrutiny.  And all nine Justices agree that the City cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.  I therefore see no reason to decide in this case whether Smith should be overruled, much less what should replace it.  I join the Court’s opinion in full.
