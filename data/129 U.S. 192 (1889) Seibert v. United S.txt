Seibert v. United States ex Rel. Harshman
No. 130
Submitted December 18, 1889
Decided January 21, 1889
129 U.S. 192

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI
Syllabus 
Siebert v. Lewis, 122 U. S. 284, was very carefully and elaborately considered, and is adhered to.

															The case is stated in the opinion. 
															Page 129 U. S. 193
															

															MR. JUSTICE FIELD delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The facts of this case are similar to those in Seibert v. Lewis, before the Court at its October term, 1886, 122 U. S. 284, and it is admitted by the counsel for the plaintiff in error that the decision there, if adhered to, will control here.  He, however, asks us to reconsider our rulings and reverse our former judgment.  We see no reason to justify such reconsideration and change of position.  The very elaborate argument of counsel is but a re-presentation of the reasons originally offered against the decision in that and analogous cases.  Seibert v. Lewis was very carefully and elaborately considered, and to the doctrines there announced we adhere.  Upon its authority,

															The judgment of the court below must be affirmed.
