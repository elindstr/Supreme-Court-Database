															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. JOHN
DENNISAPEL

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[February 26, 2014]

															

															     Justice Ginsburg,
with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, concurring.

															     I agree with the
Court’s reading of 18 U. S. C. §1382: The
military’s choice “to secure a portion of the Base more
closely—be it with a fence, a checkpoint, or a painted green
line—does not alter the boundaries of the Base or diminish
the jurisdiction of the military commander.” Ante, at 11. But
a key inquiry remains, for the fence, checkpoint, and painted line,
while they do not alterthe Base boundaries, may alter the First
Amendment calculus.

															     When the Government
permits the public onto part of its property, in either a
traditional or designated public forum, its “ability to
permissibly restrict expressive conduct is very limited.”
United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177 (1983) . In such
venues, the Government may enforce “reasonable time, place,
and manner regulations,” but those regulations must be
“content-neutral [and] narrowly tailored to serve a
significant government interest.” Ibid. (internal quotation
marks omitted).

															     The stated interest of
the Air Force in keeping Apel out of the area designated for
peaceful protest lies in ensuring base security. Brief for United
States 22–26. See also Reply Brief 21–22. That
interest, however, must be assessed in light of the general
public’s (including Apel’s) permission to traverse, at
any hour of the day or night, the highway located a few feet from
the designated protest area. See Appendix to opinion of the Court,
ante (displaying maps of the area). The Air Force also permits open
access to the middle school, bus stop, and visitors’ center,
all situated in close proximity to the protest area. See ante, at
2.

															     As the Air Force has
exhibited no “special interes[t] in who walks [or]
talks” in these places, Flower v. United States, 407
U. S. 197, 198 (1972) (per curiam), it is questionable whether
Apel’s ouster from the protest area can withstand
constitutional review. The Court has properly reserved that issue
for consideration on remand. Ante, at 13. In accord with that
reservation, I join the Court’s opinion.
