BREYER, J., DISSENTING
MEDELLIN V. DRETKE
544 U. S. ____ (2005)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 04-5928

															JOSE ERNESTO MEDELLIN, PETITIONER v. DOUG
DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,
CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the fifth circuit

															[May 23, 2005]

															   Justice Breyer, with whom Justice
Stevens joins, dissenting.

															   I agree with Justice Ginsburg
that, in light of recent developments, this Court should simply
grant Medellín’s motion for a stay. See ante,
at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring); see also ante, at
1–2 (Souter, J., dissenting). But, in the absence of majority
support for a stay, I would vacate the Fifth Circuit’s
judgment and remand the case rather than simply dismiss the writ as
improvidently granted. I join Justice O’Connor’s
dissent, for she would do the same. See ante, at 6,
19–20.

															   For one thing, Medellín’s legal
argument that “American courts are now bound to follow the
ICJ’s decision in Avena” is substantial, and
the Fifth Circuit erred in holding the contrary. Ante, at
11 (O’Connor, J., dissenting); see 371 F. 3d 270,
279–280 (2004). By vacating its judgment and remanding the
case, we would remove from the books an erroneous legal
determination that we granted certiorari to review.

															   Nor would a remand “invite the Fifth
Circuit to conduct proceedings rival to those” unfolding in
the Texas courts. Ante, at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).
Rather, I should expect the Fifth Circuit to recognize two
practical circumstances that favor its entering a stay. See
ante, at 19–20 (O’Connor, J., dissenting); see
also ante, at 2–3 (Souter, J., dissenting).

															   First, the President has decided that state
courts should follow Avena. See Case Concerning Avena
and Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2004
I. C J. No. 128 (Judgment of Mar. 31); George W. Bush,
Memorandum for the Attorney General (Feb. 28, 2005), App. 2 to
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9a. And that fact
permits Medellín to argue in the Texas courts that the
President’s determination—taken together with (1) the
self-executing nature of the treaty, (2) the Nation’s
signature on the Optional Protocol, (3) the International Court of
Justice’s (ICJ) determination that the United States give
Medellín (and 50 other Mexican nationals)
“judicial,” i.e., court,
“review and reconsideration” of their Convention-based
claims, “by means of [the United States’] own
choosing,” and (4) the United States’
“undertak[ing]” in the United Nations Charter to comply
with ICJ judgments—requires Texas to follow the
Avena decision in Medellín’s case. Avena,
supra, ¶¶ 138–143, 153(9) (emphasis added);
Charter of the United Nations, Art. 94.1, 59 Stat. 1051; cf.
Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall. 199, 237 (1796) (treaties
“superior to the Constitution and laws of any individual
state” (emphasis deleted)); Sale v. Haitian
Centers Council, Inc., 509 U. S. 155, 188
(1993) (President possesses “unique responsibility” for
the conduct of “foreign … affairs”); see also
American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi,
539 U. S. 396,
414–416 (2003) (President has a degree of independent
authority to pre-empt state law); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Arts.
11.01, 11.071 (Vernon 2005) (Texas courts possess jurisdiction to
hear Medellín’s claims).

															   Second, several Members of this Court have
confirmed that the federal questions implicated in this case are
important, thereby suggesting that further review here after the
Texas courts reach their own decisions may well be appropriate. See
ante, at 5 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (it is “this
Court’s responsibility” to address and resolve any
significant legal ICJ-related issues that may arise in the
state-court proceedings).

															   The first consideration means that
Medellín’s claims when considered in state court are
stronger than when considered in federal court—and suggests
the very real possibility of his victory in state court. The second
consideration means that a loss in state court would likely be
followed by review in this Court. Taken together they mean that, by
staying the case on remand, the Fifth Circuit could well avoid the
need for any further federal proceedings, or at least obtain
additional guidance from this Court before taking further action.
Given these practical circumstances, it seems to me unlikely that,
were we to remand this case, the Fifth Circuit would move forward
on its own, rather than stay its hand until the conclusion of
proceedings in the state courts and possibly here.

															   For these reasons and those set forth by
Justice O’Connor, I agree with the course of action she
suggests and respectfully dissent from the Court’s decision
to dismiss the writ.
