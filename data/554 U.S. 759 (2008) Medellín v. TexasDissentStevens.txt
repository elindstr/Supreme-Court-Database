															[August 5, 2008]

															   Justice Stevens, dissenting.

															   Earlier this Term, in
Medellín v. Texas, 552 U. S. ___ (2008),
we concluded that neither the President nor the International Court
of Justice (ICJ) has the authority to require Texas to determine
whether its violation of the Vienna Convention prejudiced
petitioner. Although I agreed with the Court’s judgment, I
wrote separately to make clear my view that Texas retained the
authority—and, indeed, the duty as a matter of international
law—to remedy the potentially significant breach of the
United States’ treaty obligations identified in the
President’s Memorandum to the Attorney General. Because it
appears that Texas has not taken action to address the serious
national security and foreign policy implications of this suit, I
believe we should request the views of the Solicitor General, who
argued on behalf of the Executive Branch in earlier proceedings in
the suit, before allowing Texas to proceed with the execution.

															   As I explained in my separate opinion in
March, the cost to Texas of complying with the ICJ judgment
“would be minimal, particularly given the remote likelihood
that the violation of the Vienna Convention actually
prejudiced” this petitioner. 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
5) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). “On the other hand,
the costs of refusing to respect the ICJ’s judgment are
significant. The entire Court and the President agree that breach
will jeopardize the United States’ ‘plainly
compelling’ interests in ‘ensuring the reciprocal
observance of the Vienna Convention, protecting relations with
foreign governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of
international law.’ ” Ibid. Given these
stakes, and given that petitioner has been under a death sentence
for 14 years, waiting a short time to guarantee that the views of
the Executive have been given respectful consideration is only
prudent. Balancing the honor of the Nation against the modest
burden of a short delay to ensure that the breach is unavoidable
convinces me that the application for a stay should be granted.

															   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
