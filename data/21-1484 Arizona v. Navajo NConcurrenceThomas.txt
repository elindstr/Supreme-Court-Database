court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 22, 2023]

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full, but
write separately to highlight an additional and troubling aspect of
this suit. For decades, this Court has referred to “a general
trust relationship between the United States and the Indian
people.” United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S.
206, 225 (1983); see also Seminole Nation v. United
States, 316 U.S.
286, 296–297 (1942); Haaland v. Brackeen,
599 U. S. ___, ___ (2023) (slip op., at 12). Here, in allowing
the Navajo Nation’s “breach of trust” claim to go
forward, the Ninth Circuit appears to have understood that language
as recognizing a generic legal duty of the Federal Government
toward Indian tribes or, at least, as placing a thumb on the scale
in favor of declaring that legal duties are owed to tribes. See 26
F. 4th 794, 813 (2022). As the Court explains, the Nation has
pointed to no source of legally enforceable duties supporting its
claim in this suit. But the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning
reflects deeper problems with this Court’s frequent
invocation of the Indian “trust relationship.”

															At the outset, it should be noted that our
precedents’ “trust” language can be understood in
two different ways. In one sense, the term “trust”
could refer merely to the trust that Indians have placed in the
Federal Government. If that is all this language means, then I have
no objection. Many citizens (and foreign nations) trust the Federal
Government to do the right thing. Determining how to do right by
the competing interests of the country’s millions of
citizens, however, is generally a job for the political branches,
not courts.

															By contrast, the term “trust” also
has a well-understood meaning at law: a relationship in which a
trustee has legally enforceable duties to manage a discrete trust
corpus for certain beneficiaries. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts
§2 (2001). At times, the Federal Government has expressly
created such discrete legal trusts for Indians—by, for
example, placing parcels of land or specified sums of money into
trust. See, e.g., Cass County v. Leech Lake Band
of Chippewa Indians, 524 U.S.
103, 106–107, 114 (1998) (describing statutory grants of
authority to place lands in trust for Indians); Seminole
Nation, 316 U. S., at 293–294 (describing “the
Government’s promise” in a particular treaty “to
establish a $500,000 trust fund” for the Seminole Nation).
But, when resolving disputes about those trusts, the Court’s
“trust” language has gone beyond the discrete terms of
those trusts; for example, the Court has alluded generally to
“the distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the
Government in its dealings” with Indians and the
Government’s “moral obligations of the highest
responsibility and trust.” Id., at 296–297. In
those and other cases, the Court has accordingly blurred the lines
between the political branches’ general moral obligations to
Indians, on the one hand, and specific fiduciary obligations of the
Federal Government that might be enforceable in court, on the
other. See, e.g., Mitchell, 463 U. S., at 225;
Seminole Nation, 316 U. S., at 296–297; see also
Cobell v. Norton, 
240 F.3d 1081, 1086 (CADC 2001); Shoshone Indian Tribe of
Wind River Reservation v. United States, 
364 F.3d 1339, 1348 (CA Fed. 2004).

															In United States v. Jicarilla Apache
Nation, 564 U.S.
162 (2011), the Court took steps to rectify this confusion.
There, we explained that the Federal Government is “not a
private trustee” but a “sovereign,” id.,
at 173–174, and that “[t]he Government assumes Indian
trust responsibilities only to the extent it expressly accepts
those responsibilities by statute,” id., at 177.
Accordingly, any legal trusts established or duties self-imposed by
the Government for a tribe’s benefit are “defined and
governed by statutes rather than the common law.” Id.,
at 174; see also id., at 173 (emphasizing that
“ ‘[t]he general relationship between the
United States and the Indian tribes is not comparable to a private
trust relationship’ ”). The Court’s opinion
today represents a step in the same direction, making clear that
tribes’ legal claims against the Government must be based on
specific provisions of positive law, not merely an amorphous
“trust relationship.”

															However, the Court has also invoked the
“trust relationship” to shape at least two other areas
of its Indian-law jurisprudence—with questionable results.
For example, the Court has identified “the unique trust
relationship” with the Indians as the source of pro-Indian
“canons of construction” that are supposedly
“applicable [only] in Indian law.” County of
Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U.S.
226, 247 (1985); see also EEOC v. Karuk Tribe Housing
Auth., 
260 F.3d 1071, 1081 (CA9 2001) (refusing to apply the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to tribes in part because
of those canons). But it is far from clear how such a trust
relationship would support different interpretive tools. The first
cases to apply those pro-Indian canons did not ground them in any
“trust relationship,” but in the more basic idea that
ambiguous treaty provisions should be construed against the
drafting party. See, e.g., Patterson v. Jenks,
2 Pet. 216, 229 (1829); Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet.
515, 552 (1832); The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737, 760
(1867); Restatement (Second) of Contracts §206 (1979);
Restatement (First) of Contracts §505 (1932). These canons
then “jumped without discussion from the interpretation of
treaties to the interpretation of statutes” in the 20th
century. A. Barrett, Substantive Canons and Faithful Agency, 90 B.
U. L. Rev. 109, 152 (2010). To this day, it remains unclear
how the “trust relationship” could justify freestanding
pro-Indian canons that authorize courts to depart from the ordinary
rules of statutory interpretation.

															Next, the Court has also suggested that the
“trust relationship” provides the Federal Government
with an additional power, not enumerated in the Constitution, to
“do all that [is] required” to protect Indians.
Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S.
535, 552 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also
Board of County Comm’rs v. Seber, 318 U.S.
705, 715–716 (1943). In doing so, the Court has
apparently used the trust relationship to feed into the so-called
plenary power that Congress supposedly enjoys over Indian affairs.
But the Court has also approved the use of that power to, among
other things, restrict tribal sovereignty and “eliminate
tribal rights.” See South Dakota v. Yankton
Sioux Tribe, 522 U.S.
329, 343 (1998); Washington v. Confederated Bands and
Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U.S.
463, 501 (1979); Haaland, 599 U. S., at ___
(Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 35). Accordingly, it is
difficult to see how such a plenary power could be rooted in a
trust relationship with Indians. And it seems at least slightly
incongruous to use Indians’ trust in the Government as both
the basis for a power that can restrict tribal rights and canons of
interpretation that favor Indians.

															The influence of the “trust
relationship” idea on these doctrinal areas is troubling, as
the trust relationship appears to lack any real support in our
constitutional system. See id., at ___–___ (slip op.,
at 26–27). The text of the Constitution (which mentions
Indians only in the contexts of commerce and apportionment) is
completely silent on any such trust relationship. See Art. I,
§§2, 8; Amdt. 14, §2. Further, the trust
relationship does not have any historical basis. Its genesis is
usually traced to this Court’s statement in Cherokee
Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1 (1831), that the relation of
the United States to Indians has “resembl[ed] that of a ward
to his guardian,” id., at 17; see also F. Cohen,
Handbook of Federal Indian Law §2.02[2], p. 117 (2012)
(Cohen). However, that statement was dicta, see Haaland, 599
U. S., at ___–___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at
25–27); and, in any event, the Indian Tribe in that case had
a specific treaty calling for the Federal Government’s
“protection,” Cherokee Nation, 5 Pet., at
17. Some treaties with tribes have contained similar
provisions; others have not. Compare Treaty With the Wyandots, 7
Stat. 31, with Treaty With the Mohawks, 7 Stat. 61. And, of course,
some tribes before and after the Founding engaged in warfare with
the Federal Government. Cohen §1.03[2], at 36; id.,
§1.03[3], at 40. In short, the idea of a generic trust
relationship with all tribes—to say nothing of legally
enforceable fiduciary duties—seems to lack a historical or
constitutional basis.

															In future cases, we should clarify the exact
status of this amorphous and seemingly ungrounded “trust
relationship.” As a start, it would be helpful to acknowledge
that many of this Court’s statements about the trust
relationship were mere dicta. E.g., Seminole Nation,
316 U. S., at 293–294 (discrete trust); Mancari,
417 U. S., at 551–552 (equal protection challenge to
Government hiring program); Seber, 318 U. S., at 707
(state taxes on Indian lands). In the meantime, however, the Court
should take care to ensure that this confusion does not spill over
into yet further areas of the law.
