															COINBASE, INC., PETITIONER v. ABRAHAM
BIELSKI

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 23, 2023]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															When a federal district court denies a motion to
compel arbitration, the losing party has a statutory right to an
interlocutory appeal. See 9 U. S. C. §16(a). The
sole question here is whether the district court must stay its
pre-trial and trial proceedings while the interlocutory appeal is
ongoing. The answer is yes: The district court must stay its
proceedings.

															Coinbase operates an online platform on which
users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies and government-issued
currencies. When creating a Coinbase account, individuals agree to
the terms in Coinbase’s User Agreement. As relevant here, the
User Agreement contains an arbitration provision, which directs
that disputes arising under the agreement be resolved through
binding arbitration.

															This case concerns a putative class action filed
against Coinbase in the U. S. District Court for the Northern
District of California. Abraham Bielski sued on behalf of Coinbase
users who allege that Coinbase failed to replace funds fraudulently
taken from the users’ accounts.

															The District Court denied Coinbase’s
motion to compel arbitration. Coinbase then filed an interlocutory
appeal to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
under 9 U. S. C. §16(a).[1] Section 16(a) authorizes an interlocutory appeal from
the denial of a motion to compel arbitration.

															Coinbase also moved to stay District Court
proceedings pending resolution of the arbitrability issue on
appeal. The District Court declined to stay its proceedings. After
receiving Coinbase’s motion for a stay, the Ninth Circuit
likewise declined to stay the District Court’s proceedings.
The Ninth Circuit followed its precedent, under which an appeal
from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration does not
automatically stay district court proceedings. See Britton
v. Co-op Banking Group, 916 F.2d 1405, 1412 (1990). By
contrast, however, most other Courts of Appeals to address the
question have held that a district court must stay its proceedings
while the interlocutory appeal on the question of arbitrability is
ongoing. E.g., Bradford-Scott Data Corp. v.
Physician Computer Network, Inc., 
128
F.3d 504, 506 (CA7 1997).

															To resolve that disagreement among the Courts of
Appeals, we granted certiorari. 598 U. S. ___ (2022).

															II

															The Federal Arbitration Act governs
arbitration agreements. In 1988, Congress passed and President
Reagan signed an amendment to the Act; the amendment is codified at
9 U. S. C. §16(a). Under §16(a), when a
district court denies a party’s motion to compel arbitration,
that party may take an interlocutory appeal. Section 16(a) creates
a rare statutory exception to the usual rule that parties may not
appeal before final judgment. See Mohawk Industries, Inc. v.
Carpenter, 558 U.S.
100, 108–109 (2009). Notably, Congress provided for
immediate interlocutory appeals of orders denying—but
not of orders granting—motions to compel
arbitration.

															The sole question before this Court is whether a
district court must stay its proceedings while the interlocutory
appeal on arbitrability is ongoing. The answer is yes.

															Section 16(a) does not say whether the district
court proceedings must be stayed. But Congress enacted §16(a)
against a clear background principle prescribed by this
Court’s precedents: An appeal, including an interlocutory
appeal, “divests the district court of its control over those
aspects of the case involved in the appeal.” Griggs v.
Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S.
56, 58 (1982). That Griggs principle reflects a
longstanding tenet of American procedure. See Hovey v.
McDonald, 109 U.S.
150, 157 (1883); see also Price v. Dunn, 587
U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., joined by Alito and
Gorsuch, JJ., concurring in denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 7)
(describing Griggs principle as “well settled”);
Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons,
470 U.S.
373, 379 (1985) (“In general, filing of a notice of
appeal confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the
district court of control over those aspects of the case involved
in the appeal”).

															The Griggs principle resolves this case.
Because the question on appeal is whether the case belongs in
arbitration or instead in the district court, the entire case is
essentially “involved in the appeal.” 459 U. S.,
at 58. As Judge Easterbrook cogently explained, when a party
appeals the denial of a motion to compel arbitration, whether
“the litigation may go forward in the district court is
precisely what the court of appeals must decide.”
Bradford-Scott Data Corp. v. Physician Computer Network,
Inc., 
128
F.3d 504, 506 (CA7 1997). Stated otherwise, the question of
whether “the case should be litigated in the district court
. . . is the mirror image of the question presented on
appeal.” Id., at 505. Here, as elsewhere, it
“makes no sense for trial to go forward while the court of
appeals cogitates on whether there should be one.”
Apostol v. Gallion, 870 F.2d 1335, 1338 (CA7 1989).
In short, Griggs dictates that the district court must stay
its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability is
ongoing.[2]

															Most courts of appeals to address the question
in the §16(a) context have reached that same conclusion.
E.g., Blinco v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC,

366 F.3d 1249, 
1253 (CA11 2004) (“[I]t makes little sense for the
litigation to continue in the district court while the appeal is
pending”).[3] Leading
treatises agree that a district court should stay its proceedings
while the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability is ongoing. For
example, Moore’s treatise states that a “stay in these
circumstances” is “the sounder approach” and
“is consistent with the general [Griggs] principle
that a district court should not exercise jurisdiction over those
aspects of the case that are involved in the appeal.” 19 J.
Moore, D. Coquillette, G. Joseph, G. Vairo, & C. Varner,
Moore’s Federal Practice §203.12[3][a] (3d ed. 2022).
Similarly, the Wright and Miller treatise endorses the automatic
stay requirement in arbitration cases. The treatise explains that a
“complete stay of district-court proceedings pending appeal
from a refusal to order arbitration is desirable” because
“[c]ontinued trial-court proceedings pending appeal could
lead to an entirely wasted trial if arbitration is ordered on
appeal.” 15B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal
Practice and Procedure §3914.17, p. 7 (2d ed., Supp. 2022). In
the Circuits that have considered the issue in the analogous
contexts of qualified immunity and double jeopardy, moreover,
district courts likewise must automatically stay their proceedings
while the interlocutory appeal is ongoing.[4] Similarly, as Bielski acknowledges, courts have held
that the Griggs principle applies to those aspects of the
case involved in a certified interlocutory appeal under 28
U. S. C. §1292(b).[5]

															The common practice in §16(a) cases,
therefore, is for a district court to stay its proceedings while
the interlocutory appeal on arbitrability is ongoing. That common
practice reflects common sense. Absent an automatic stay of
district court proceedings, Congress’s decision in
§16(a) to afford a right to an interlocutory appeal would be
largely nullified. If the district court could move forward with
pre-trial and trial proceedings while the appeal on arbitrability
was ongoing, then many of the asserted benefits of arbitration
(efficiency, less expense, less intrusive discovery, and the like)
would be irretrievably lost—even if the court of appeals
later concluded that the case actually had belonged in arbitration
all along. Absent a stay, parties also could be forced to settle to
avoid the district court proceedings (including discovery and
trial) that they contracted to avoid through arbitration. That
potential for coercion is especially pronounced in class actions,
where the possibility of colossal liability can lead to what Judge
Friendly called “blackmail settlements.” H. Friendly,
Federal Jurisdiction: A General View 120 (1973).

															As Judge Easterbrook stated, continuation of
proceedings in the district court “largely defeats the point
of the appeal.” Bradford-Scott, 128 F. 3d, at
505. A right to interlocutory appeal of the arbitrability issue
without an automatic stay of the district court proceedings is
therefore like a lock without a key, a bat without a ball, a
computer without a keyboard—in other words, not especially
sensible.

															From the Judiciary’s institutional
perspective, moreover, allowing a case to proceed simultaneously in
the district court and the court of appeals creates the possibility
that the district court will waste scarce judicial
resources—which could be devoted to other pressing criminal
or civil matters—on a dispute that will ultimately head to
arbitration in any event. That scenario represents the “worst
possible outcome” for parties and the courts: litigating a
dispute in the district court only for the court of appeals to
“reverse and order the dispute arbitrated.” Id.,
at 506. The Griggs rule avoids that detrimental result.

															Importantly, Congress’s longstanding
practice both reflects and reinforces the Griggs rule. When
Congress wants to authorize an interlocutory appeal and to
automatically stay the district court proceedings during that
appeal, Congress need not say anything about a stay. At least
absent contrary indications, the background Griggs principle
already requires an automatic stay of district court proceedings
that relate to any aspect of the case involved in the appeal. By
contrast, when Congress wants to authorize an interlocutory appeal,
but not to automatically stay district court proceedings
pending that appeal, Congress typically says so. Since the creation
of the modern courts of appeals system in 1891, Congress has
enacted multiple statutory “non-stay”
provisions.[6] Indeed, Congress
enacted a “non-stay” provision the day before enacting
§16(a) in 1988. See 102Stat. 4120 (“Neither the
application for, nor the granting of, an appeal . . .
shall stay proceedings in the Court of Veterans
Appeals”).

															In short, the Griggs rule requires that a
district court stay its proceedings while the interlocutory appeal
on the question of arbitrability is ongoing.

															III

															To overcome the Griggs principle,
Bielski advances five main arguments. None is persuasive.

															First, Bielski contends that an automatic
stay would encourage frivolous appeals that would improperly delay
district court proceedings. To begin with, Bielski has not
established that frivolous appeals frequently occur in the Circuits
that have long applied the Griggs principle in arbitration
cases. Cf. Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White
Sales, Inc., 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 8).
Nor does Bielski argue that Coinbase’s appeal in this case is
frivolous. Importantly, moreover, the courts of appeals possess
robust tools to prevent unwarranted delay and deter frivolous
interlocutory appeals. For example, a party can ask the court of
appeals to summarily affirm, to expedite an interlocutory appeal,
or to dismiss the interlocutory appeal as frivolous. In addition,
nearly every circuit has developed a process by which a district
court itself may certify that an interlocutory appeal is frivolous.
Brief for Petitioner 51; see also Arthur Andersen LLP v.
Carlisle, 556 U.S.
624, 629 (2009) (“Appellate courts can streamline the
disposition of meritless claims and even authorize the district
court’s retention of ” a case “when an
appeal is certified as frivolous”). Finally, a court of
appeals may impose sanctions where appropriate; the possibility of
sanctions also helps deter frivolous appeals. See Fed. Rule App.
Proc. 38; Arthur Andersen, 556 U. S., at 629.

															Second, Bielski contrasts §16(a)
with two other statutory provisions that contain an explicit stay
requirement—§3 of the Federal Arbitration Act and
§1292(d)(4) of Title 28. Bielski suggests that Congress would
not have included those explicit stay requirements in §3 and
§1292(d)(4) unless Congress thought that an interlocutory
appeal did not ordinarily stay district court proceedings. Bielski
is wrong.

															Section 3 of the Act provides for a stay of
court proceedings pending arbitration, not pending an
appeal. That situation does not fall within the Griggs rule.
No background principle requires automatic stays of district court
proceedings pending arbitration. In order to
automatically stay court proceedings pending arbitration in those
cases, Congress therefore affirmatively codified a stay
requirement.

															As to §1292(d)(4): When Congress added
§1292(d)(4)’s stay requirement in 1988, the relevant
subsection already contained a provision, §1292(d)(3), that
expressly made stays of proceedings in certain courts discretionary
rather than mandatory. To avoid any misinterpretation of
§1292(d)(4) because of that preexisting language in
§1292(d)(3), Congress specified the right to an automatic stay
pending appeal in §1292(d)(4). That unusual circumstance does
not diminish the operation of the Griggs rule in the context
of arbitrability appeals.

															Third, Bielski contends that requiring an
automatic stay would create a special, arbitration-preferring
procedural rule. That is incorrect. In fact, Bielski’s
proposed approach would disfavor arbitration. Applying the
Griggs rule here simply subjects arbitrability appeals to
the same stay principles that courts apply in other analogous
contexts where an interlocutory appeal is authorized, including
qualified immunity and double jeopardy. Bielski further points to
forum selection clauses as an analogy. But unlike §16(a)
arbitrability appeals, Congress has not created a right to an
interlocutory appeal for cases involving forum selection clauses.
So a stay in the forum selection context could be required only in
those cases where there is a certified §1292(b) interlocutory
appeal of the forum selection issue.

															Fourth, Bielski suggests that there is no
need for an automatic stay because the ordinary discretionary stay
factors would adequately protect parties’ rights to an
interlocutory appellate determination of arbitrability. To begin
with, experience shows that Bielski is incorrect. District courts
and courts of appeals applying the usual four-factor standard for a
discretionary stay often deny stays in §16(a) appeals because
courts applying that test often do not consider litigation-related
burdens (here, from the continued District Court proceedings) to
constitute irreparable harm. See Nken v. Holder,
556 U.S.
418, 434–435 (2009); FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of
Cal., 449 U.S.
232, 244 (1980) (“Mere litigation expense, even
substantial and unrecoupable cost, does not constitute irreparable
injury” (internal quotation marks omitted)); App. to Pet. for
Cert. 43a (District Court in Bielski stating that
“[m]ere litigation expenses do not generally constitute
irreparable injury” for purposes of stay pending appeal). In
any event, the background Griggs rule applies regardless of
how often courts might otherwise grant stays under the ordinary
discretionary stay factors.

															Fifth, Bielski relies on this
Court’s statement that questions of arbitrability are
“severable from the merits of the underlying disputes.”
Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr.
Corp., 460 U.S.
1, 21 (1983). But the sole issue here is whether the district
court’s authority to consider a case is “involved in
the appeal” when an appellate court considers the threshold
question of arbitrability. Griggs, 459 U. S., at 58.
The answer is yes, and Moses H. Cone says nothing to the
contrary.

															*  *  *

															We conclude that, after Coinbase appealed from
the denial of its motion to compel arbitration, the District Court
was required to stay its proceedings. On remand, we anticipate that
the Ninth Circuit here, as we anticipate in §16(a) appeals
more generally, will proceed with appropriate expedition when
considering Coinbase’s interlocutory appeal from the denial
of the motion to compel arbitration. We reverse the judgment of the
Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.[7]

															

															It is so ordered.
