															AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANIES, INC.,etÂ al.,
PETITIONERS v. AEREO, INC., fkaBAMBOOM LABS, INC.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the second circuit

															[June 25, 2014]

															Â Â Â Â  Justice
Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Alito join,
dissenting.

															Â Â Â Â  This case
is the latest skirmish in the long-running copyright battle over
the delivery of television programming. Petitioners, a collection
of television networks and affiliates (Networks), broadcast
copyrighted programs on the public airwaves for all to see. Aereo,
respondent, operates an automated system that allows subscribers to
receive, on Internet-connected devices, programs that they select,
including the Networksâ€™ copyrighted programs.
The Networks sued Aereo for several forms of copyright
infringement, but we are here concerned with a single claim: that
Aereo violates the Networksâ€™
â€œexclusive righ[t]â€ to
â€œperformâ€ their programs
â€œpublicly.â€17
U.Â S.Â C. Â§106(4). That claim
fails at the very outset because Aereo does not
â€œperformâ€ at all. The Court manages
to reach the opposite conclusion only by disregarding widely
accepted rules for service-provider liability and adopting in their
place an improvised standard
(â€œlooks-like-cable-TVâ€) that will
sow confusion for years to come.

															I. Legal Standard

															Â Â Â Â  There are
two types of liability for copyright infringement: direct and
secondary. As its name suggests, the former applies when an actor
personally engages in infringing conduct. See Sony Corp. of America
v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,464 U.Â S. 417,433
(1984). Secondary liability, by contrast, is a means of holding
defendants responsible for infringement by third parties, even when
the defendants â€œhave not themselves engaged in
the infringing activity.â€ Id., at 435. It applies when
a defendant â€œintentionally induc[es] or
encourag[es]â€ infringing acts by others or profits from
such acts â€œwhile declining to exercise a right
to stop or limit [them].â€ Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios
Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.,545 U. S. 913,930 (2005).

															Â Â Â Â  Most suits
against equipment manufacturers and service providers involve
secondary-liability claims. For ex-ample, when movie studios sued
to block the sale ofSonyâ€™s Betamax videocassette
recorder (VCR), they argued that Sony was liable because its
customers were making unauthorized copies. See Sony, supra, at
434â€“435. Record labels and movie studios relied
on a similar theory when they sued Grokster and StreamCast, two
providers of peer-to-peer file-sharing software. See Grokster,
supra, at 920â€“921, 927.

															Â Â Â Â  This suit,
or rather the portion of it before us here, is fundamentally
different. The Networks claim that Aereo directly infringes their
public-performance right. Accordingly, the Networks must prove that
Aereo â€œperform[s]â€ copyrighted
works, Â§106(4), when its subscribers log in, select a
channel, and push the â€œwatchâ€
button. That process undoubtedly results in a performance; the
question is who does the performing. See Cartoon Network LP, LLLP
v. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F.Â 3d 121, 130 (CA2 2008).
If Aereoâ€™s subscribers perform but Aereo does
not, the claim necessarily fails.

															Â Â Â Â  The
Networksâ€™ claim is governed by a simple but
profoundly important rule: A defendant may be held directly liable
only if it has engaged in volitional conduct that violates the Act.
See 3 W. Patry, Copyright Â§9:5.50 (2013). This
requirement is firmly grounded in the Actâ€™s
text, which defines â€œperformâ€ in
active, affirmative terms: One
â€œperform[s]â€ a copyrighted
â€œaudiovisual work,â€ such as a movie
or news broadcast, by â€œshow[ing] its images in
any sequenceâ€ or â€œmak[ing] the
sounds accompanying it audible.â€ Â§101. And
since the Act makes it unlawful to copy or perform copyrighted
works, not to copy or perform in general, see Â§501(a),
the volitional-act requirement demands conduct directed to the
plaintiffâ€™s copyrighted material, see Sony,
supra, at 434. Every Court of Appeals to have considered an
automated-service providerâ€™s direct liability
for copyright infringement has adopted that rule. See Fox
Broadcasting Co. v. Dish Network LLC, 747 F. 3d 1060,
1066â€“1068 (CA9 2014); Cartoon Network, supra, at
130â€“131 (CA2 2008); CoStar Group, Inc. v.
LoopNet, Inc., 373 F. 3d 544, 549â€“550 (CA4
2004).[1] Although we have not opined on the
issue, our cases are fully consistent with a volitional-conduct
requirement. For example, we gave several examples of direct
infringement in Sony, each of which involved a volitional act
directed to the plaintiffâ€™s copyrighted
material. See 464 U.Â S., at 437, n.Â 18.

															Â Â Â Â  The
volitional-conduct requirement is not at issue in most
direct-infringement cases; the usual point of dispute is whether
the defendantâ€™s conduct is infringing (e.g.,
Does the defendantâ€™s design copy the
plaintiffâ€™s?), rather than whether the defendant
has acted at all (e.g., Did this defendant create the infringing
design?). But it comes right to the fore when a direct-infringement
claim is lodged against a defendant who does nothing more than
operate an automated, user-controlled system. See, e.g., Fox
Broadcasting, supra, at 1067; Cartoon Network, supra, at 131.
Internet-service providers are a prime example. When one user sends
data to another, the providerâ€™s equipment
facilitates the transfer automatically. Does that mean that the
provider is directly liable when the transmission happens to result
in the â€œreproduc[tion],â€
Â§106(1), of a copyrighted work? It does not. The
providerâ€™s system is â€œtotally
indifferent to the materialâ€™s
content,â€ whereas courts require
â€œsome aspect of volitionâ€ directed
at the copyrighted material before direct liability may be imposed.
CoStar, 373 F.Â 3d, at
550â€“551.[2] The defendant may
be held directly liable only if the defendant itself
â€œtrespassed on the exclusive domain of the
copyright owner.â€ Id., at 550. Most of the time that
issue will come down to who selects the copyrighted content: the
defendant or its customers. See Cartoon Network, supra,
at131â€“132.

															Â Â Â Â  A
comparison between copy shops and video-on-demand services
illustrates the point. A copy shop rents out photocopiers on a
per-use basis. One customer might copy his
10-year-oldâ€™s drawingsâ€”a
perfectly lawful thing to doâ€”while another might
duplicate a famous artistâ€™s copyrighted
photographsâ€”a use clearly prohibited by
Â§106(1). Either way, the customer chooses the content
and activates the copying function; the photocopier does nothing
except in response to the customerâ€™s commands.
Because the shop plays no role in selecting the content, it cannot
be held directly liable when a customer makes an infringing copy.
See CoStar, supra, at 550.

															Â Â Â Â 
Video-on-demand services, like photocopiers, respond automatically
to user input, but they differ in one crucial respect: They choose
the content. When a user signs in to Netflix, for example,
â€œthousands of .Â .Â .
movies [and] TV episodesâ€ carefully curated by Netflix
are â€œavailable to watch instantly.â€
See How [D]oes Netflix [W]ork?, online at
http://help.netflix.com/en/node/412 (as visited June 20, 2014, and
available in Clerk of Courtâ€™s case file). That
selection and arrangement by the service provider constitutes a
volitional act directed to specific copyrighted works and thus
serves as a basis for direct liability.

															Â Â Â Â  The
distinction between direct and secondary liability would collapse
if there were not a clear rule for deter-mining whether the
defendant committed the infringing act. See Cartoon Network, 536
F.Â 3d, at 132â€“133. The
volitional-conduct requirement supplies that rule; its purpose is
not to excuse defendants from accountability, but to channel the
claims against them into the correct analytical track. See Brief
for 36 Intellectual Property and Copyright Law Professors as Amici
Curiae 7. Thus, in the example given above, the fact that the copy
shop does not choose the content simply means that its culpability
will be assessed using secondary-liability rules rather than
direct-liability rules. See Sony, supra, at
434â€“442; Cartoon Network, supra, at
132â€“133.

															II. Application to Aereo

															Â Â Â Â  So which is
Aereo: the copy shop or the video-on-demand service? In truth, it
is neither. Rather, it is akin to a copy shop that provides its
patrons with a library card. Aereo offers access to an automated
system consisting of routers, servers, transcoders, and dime-sized
antennae. Like a photocopier or VCR, that system lies dormant until
a subscriber activates it. When a subscriber selects a program,
Aereoâ€™s system picks up the relevant broadcast
signal, translates its audio and video components into digital
data, stores the data in a user-specific file, and transmits that
fileâ€™s contents to the subscriber via the
Internetâ€”at which point the
subscriberâ€™s laptop, tablet, or other device
displays the broadcast just as an ordinary television would. The
result of that process fits the statutory definition of a
performance to a tee: The subscriberâ€™s device
â€œshow[s]â€ the
broadcastâ€™s
â€œimagesâ€ and
â€œmake[s] the sounds accompanyingâ€
the broadcast â€œaudible.â€
Â§101. The only question is whether those performances
are the product of Aereoâ€™s volitional
conduct.

															Â Â Â Â  They are
not. Unlike video-on-demand services, Aereo does not provide a
prearranged assortment of movies and television shows. Rather, it
assigns each subscriber an antenna thatâ€”like a
library cardâ€”can be used to obtain whatever
broadcasts are freely available. Some of those broadcasts are
copyrighted; others are in the public domain. The key point is that
subscribers call all the shots: Aereoâ€™s
automated system does not relay any program, copyrighted or not,
until a subscriber selects the program and tells Aereo to relay it.
Aereoâ€™s operation of that system is a volitional
act and a but-for cause of the resulting performances, but, as in
the case of the copy shop, that degree of involvement is not enough
for direct liability. See Grokster, 545 U.Â S., at 960
(Breyer, J., concurring) (â€œ[T]he producer of a
technology which permits unlawful copying does not himself engage
in unlawful copyingâ€).

															Â Â Â Â  In sum,
Aereo does not â€œperformâ€ for the
sole and simple reason that it does not make the choice of content.
And because Aereo does not perform, it cannot be held directly
liable for infringing the Networksâ€™
public-performance right.[3] That conclusion does
not necessarily mean that Aereoâ€™s service
complies with the Copyright Act. Quite the contrary. The
Networksâ€™ complaint alleges that Aereo is
directly and secondarily liable for infringing their
public-performance rights (Â§106(4)) and also their
reproduction rights (Â§106(1)). Their request for a
preliminary injunctionâ€”the only issue before
this Courtâ€”is based exclusively on the
direct-liability portion of the public-performance claim (and
further limited to Aereoâ€™s
â€œwatchâ€ function, as opposed to its
â€œrecordâ€ function). See App. to Pet.
for Cert. 60aâ€“61a. Affirming the judgment below
would merely return this case to the lower courts for consideration
of the Networksâ€™ remaining claims.

															III. Guilt By Resemblance

															Â Â Â Â  The
Courtâ€™s conclusion that Aereo performs boils
down to the following syllogism: (1) Congress amended the Act to
overrule our decisions holding that cable systems do not perform
when they retransmit over-the-air broadcasts;[4]
(2) Aereo looks a lot like a cable system; therefore (3) Aereo
performs. Ante, at 4â€“10. That reasoning suffers
from a trio of defects.

															Â Â Â Â  First, it
is built on the shakiest of foundations. Perceiving the text to be
ambiguous, ante, at 4, the Court reaches out to decide the case
based on a few isolated snippets of legislative history, ante, at
7â€“8 (citing H.Â R. Rep. No.
94â€“1476 (1976)). The Court treats those snippets
as authoritative evidence of congressional intent even though they
come from a single report issued by a committee whose members make
up a small fraction of one of the two Houses of Congress. Little
else need be said here about the severe shortcomings of that
interpretative methodology. See Lawson v. FMR LLC, 571
U.Â S. ___, ___ (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in
principal part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at
1â€“2).

															Â Â Â Â  Second, the
Courtâ€™s reasoning fails on its own terms because
there are material differences between the cable systems at issue
in Teleprompter Corp. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.,415
U.Â S. 394 (1974), and Fortnightly Corp. v. United
Artists Television, Inc.,392 U.Â S. 390 (1968), on the
one hand and Aereo on the other. The former (which were then known
as community-antenna television systems) captured the full range of
broadcast signals and forwarded them to all subscribers at all
times, whereas Aereo transmits only specific programs selected by
the user, at specific times selected by the user. The Court
acknowledges this distinction but blithely concludes that it
â€œdoes not make a critical
difference.â€ Ante, at 10. Even if that were true, the
Court fails to account for other salient differences between the
two technologies.[5] Though cable systems started
out essentially as dumb pipes that routed signals from point A to
point B, see ante, at 5, by the 1970â€™s, that
kind of service
â€œÂ â€˜no longer
exist[ed],â€™Â â€ Brief for
Petitioners in Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Teleprompter
Corp., O. T. 1973, No. 72â€“1633, p. 22. At the
time of our Teleprompter decision, cable companies
â€œperform[ed] the same functions as
â€˜broadcastersâ€™ by
deliberately selecting and importing distant signals, originating
programs, [and] selling commercials,â€ id., at 20, thus
making them curators of contentâ€”more akin to
video-on-demand services than copy shops. So far as the record
reveals, Aereo does none of those things.

															Â Â Â Â  Third, and
most importantly, even accepting that the 1976 amendments had as
their purpose the overruling of our cable-TV cases, what they were
meant to do and how they did it are two different
questionsâ€”and it is the latter that governs the
case before us here. The injury claimed is not violation of a law
that says operations similar to cable TV are subject to copyright
liability, but violation of Â§106(4) of the Copyright
Act. And whatever soothing reasoning the Court uses to reach its
result (â€œthis looks like cable TVâ€),
the consequence of its holding is that someone who implements this
technology â€œperform[s]â€ under that
provision. That greatly disrupts settled jurisprudence which,
before today, applied the straightforward, bright-line test of
volitional conduct directed at the copyrighted work. If that test
is not outcome determinative in this case, presumably it is not
outcome determinative elsewhere as well. And it is not clear what
the Court proposes to replace it. Perhaps the Court means to adopt
(invent, really) a two-tier version of the Copyright Act, one part
of which applies to â€œcable companies and their
equivalentsâ€ while the other governs everyone else.
Ante, at 9â€“10, 16.

															Â Â Â Â  The
rationale for the Courtâ€™s adÂ hoc
rule for cable-system lookalikes is so broad that it renders nearly
a third of the Courtâ€™s opinion superfluous. Part
II of the opinion concludes that Aereo performs because it
resembles a cable company, and Congress amended the Act in 1976
â€œto bring the activities of cable systems within
[its] scope.â€ Ante, at 8. Part III of the opinion
purports to address separately the question whether Aereo performs
â€œpub-licly.â€ Ante, at
10â€“15. Trouble is, that question cannot remain
open if Congressâ€™s supposed intent to regulate
whatever looks like a cable company must be given legal effect (as
the Court says in Part II). The Act reaches only public
performances, see Â§106(4), so Congress could not have
regulated â€œthe activities of cable
systemsâ€ without deeming their retransmissions public
performances. The upshot is this: If Aereoâ€™s
similarity to a cable company means that it performs, then by
necessity that same characteristic means that it does so publicly,
and Part III of the Courtâ€™s opinion discusses an
issue that is no longer relevantâ€”though
discussing it certainly gives the opinion the
â€œfeelâ€ of real textual analysis.

															Â Â Â Â  Making
matters worse, the Court provides no criteria for determining when
its cable-TV-lookalike rule applies. Must a defendant offer access
to live television to qualify? If similarity to cable-television
service is the measure, then the answer must be yes. But consider
the implications of that answer: Aereo would be free to do exactly
what it is doing right now so long as it built mandatory time
shifting into its â€œwatchâ€
function.[6] Aereo would not be providing live
television if it made subscribers wait to tune in until after a
showâ€™s live broadcast ended. A subscriber could
watch the 7 p.m. airing of a 1-hour program any time after 8 p.m.
Assuming the Court does not intend to adopt such a do-nothing rule
(though it very well may), there must be some other means of
identifying who is and is not subject to its guilt-by-resemblance
regime.

															Â Â Â Â  Two other
criteria come to mind. One would cover any automated service that
captures and stores live television broadcasts at a
userâ€™s direction. That canâ€™t
be right, since it is exactly what remote storage digital video
recorders (RSâ€“DVRs) do, see Cartoon Network, 536
F.Â 3d, at 124â€“125, and the Court
insists that its â€œlimited holdingâ€
does not decide the fate of those devices, ante, at
16â€“17. The other potential benchmark is the one
offered by the Government: The cable-TV-lookalike rule embraces any
entity that â€œoperates an integrated system,
substantially dependent on physical equipment that is used in
common by [its] subscribers.â€ Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 20. The Court sensibly avoids that approach
because it would sweep in Internet service providers and a host of
other entities that quite obviously do not perform.

															Â Â Â Â  That leaves
as the criterion of cable-TV-resemblance nothing but
thâ€™olâ€™
totality-of-the-circumstances test (which is not a test at all but
merely assertion of an intent to perform test-free,
adÂ hoc, case-by-case evaluation). It will take years,
perhaps decades, to determine which automated systems now in
existence are governed by the tradi-tional volitional-conduct test
and which get the Aereo treatment. (And automated systems now in
contemplation will have to take their chances.) The Court vows that
its ruling will not affect cloud-storage providers and
cable-television systems, see ante, at 16â€“17,
but it cannot deliver on that promise given the imprecision of its
result-driven rule. Indeed, the difficulties inherent in the
Courtâ€™s makeshift approach will become apparent
in this very case. Todayâ€™s decision addresses
the legality of Aereoâ€™s
â€œwatchâ€ function, which provides
nearly contemporaneous access to live broadcasts. On remand, one of
the first questions the lower courts will face is whether
Aereoâ€™s â€œrecordâ€
function, which allows subscribers to save a program while it is
airing and watch it later, infringes the
Networksâ€™ public-performance right. The
volitional-conduct rule provides a clear answer to that question:
Because Aereo does not select the programs viewed by its users, it
does not perform. But it is impossible to say how the issue will
come out under the Courtâ€™s analysis, since cable
companies did not offer remote recording and playback services when
Congress amended the Copyright Act in 1976.

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															Â Â Â Â  I share the
Courtâ€™s evident feeling that what Aereo is doing
(or enabling to be done) to the Networksâ€™
copyrighted programming ought not to be allowed. But perhaps we
need not distort the Copyright Act to forbid it. As discussed at
the outset, Aereoâ€™s secondary liability for
performance infringement is yet to be determined, as is its primary
and secondary liability for reproduction infringement. If that does
not suffice, then (assuming one shares the
majorityâ€™s estimation of right and wrong) what
we have before us must be considered a
â€œloopholeâ€ in the law. It is not the
role of this Court to identify and plug loopholes. It is the role
of good lawyers to identify and exploit them, and the role of
Congress to eliminate them if it wishes. Congress can do that, I
may add, in a much more targeted, better informed, and less
disruptive fashion than the crude
â€œlooks-like-cable-TVâ€ solution the
Court invents today.

															Â Â Â Â  We came
within one vote of declaring the VCR contraband 30 years ago in
Sony. See 464 U.Â S., at 441, n. 21. The dissent in that
case was driven in part by the plaintiffsâ€™
prediction that VCR technology would wreak all manner of havoc in
the television and movie industries. See id., at 483 (opinion of
Blackmun, J.); see also Brief for CBS, Inc., as Amicus Curiae, O.
T. 1982, No. 81â€“1687, p. 2 (arguing that VCRs
â€œdirectly threatenedâ€ the bottom
line of â€œ[e]very broadcasterâ€).

															Â Â Â Â  The
Networks make similarly dire predictions about Aereo. We are told
that nothing less than â€œthe very existence of
broadcast television as we know itâ€ is at stake. Brief
for Petitioners 39. Aereo and its amici dispute those forecasts and
make a few of their own, suggesting that a decision in the
Networksâ€™ favor will stifle technological
innovation and imperil billions of dollars of investments in
cloud-storage services. See Brief for Respondents
48â€“51; Brief for BSA, The Software Alliance as
Amicus Curiae 5â€“13. We are in no position to
judge the validity of those self-interested claims or to foresee
the path of future technological development. See Sony, supra, at
430â€“431; see also Grokster, 545
U.Â S., at 958 (Breyer, J., concurring). Hence, the
proper course is not to bend and twist the Actâ€™s
terms in an effort to produce a just outcome, but to apply the law
as it stands and leave to Congress the task of deciding whether the
Copyright Act needs an upgrade. I conclude, as the Court concluded
in Sony: â€œIt may well be that Congress will take
a fresh look at this new technology, just as it so often has
examined other innovations in the past. But it is not our job to
apply laws that have not yet been written. Applying the copyright
statute, as it now reads, to the facts as they have been developed
in this case, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be
[affirmed].â€ 464 U.Â S., at 456.

															Â Â Â Â  I
respectfully dissent.

Notes
1Â An unpublished decision of the
Third Circuit is to the same effect. v. , 242 Fed. Appx. 833,
836â€“837 (2007) ().
2Â Congress has enacted several
safe-harbor provisions applicable to automated network processes,
see, â€“(b), but those provisions do not foreclose
â€œany other defense,â€
Â§512(), including a volitional-conduct
defense.
3Â Because I conclude that Aereo
does not perform at all, I do not reach the question whether the
performances in this case are to the public. See at
10â€“15.
4Â See Teleprompter Corp. v.
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 415 U. S. 394 (1974);
Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists Television, Inc., 392 U.
S. 390 (1968).
5Â The Court observes that
â€œ[t]he subscribers of the and cable systems
.Â .Â . selected what programs to display on
their receiving sets,â€ but acknowledges that those
choices were possible only because â€œthe
television signals, in a sense, lurked behind the screen, ready to
emerge when the subscriber turned the knob.â€ at 10. The
latter point is dispositive: The signals were
â€œready to emergeâ€ because the cable
systemâ€”much like a video-on-demand
providerâ€”took affirmative, volitional steps to
them there. As discussed above, the same cannot be said of the
programs available through Aereoâ€™s automated
system.
6Â Broadcasts accessible through
the â€œwatchâ€ function are technically
not live because Aereoâ€™s servers take anywhere
from a few seconds to a few minutes to begin transmitting data to a
subscriberâ€™s device. But the resulting delay is
so brief that it cannot reasonably be classified as time
shifting.
