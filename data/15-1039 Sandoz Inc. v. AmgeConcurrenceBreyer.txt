															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[June 12, 2017]

															

															Justice Breyer, concurring.

															The Court’s interpretation of the statutory terms before us is a reasonable interpretation, and I join its opinion.  In my view, Congress implicitly delegated to the Food and Drug Administration authority to interpret those same terms.  That being so, if that agency, after greater experience administering this statute, determines that a different interpretation would better serve the statute’s objectives, it may well have authority to depart from, or to modify, today’s interpretation, see National Cable & Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,

545 U. S. 967
–984 (2005), though we need not now decide any such matter.
