															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															TRANSUNION LLC, PETITIONER v. SERGIO L. RAMIREZ

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 25, 2021]

															

															Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor join, dissenting.

															The familiar story of Article III standing depicts the doctrine as an integral aspect of judicial restraint.  The case-or-controversy requirement of Article III, the account runs, is “built on a single basic idea—the idea of separation of powers.”  Allen v. Wright,

468 U.S. 737, 752 (1984).  Rigorous standing rules help safeguard that separation by keeping the courts away from issues “more appropriately addressed in the representative branches.”  Id., at 751.  In so doing, those rules prevent courts from overstepping their “proper—and properly limited—role” in “a democratic society.”  Warth v. Seldin,

422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975); see ante, at 7–8 (Thomas, J., dissenting).

															After today’s decision, that story needs a rewrite.  The Court here transforms standing law from a doctrine of judicial modesty into a tool of judicial aggrandizement.  It holds, for the first time, that a specific class of plaintiffs whom Congress allowed to bring a lawsuit cannot do so under Article III.  I join Justice Thomas’s dissent, which explains why the majority’s decision is so mistaken.  As he recounts, our Article III precedents teach that Congress has broad “power to create and define rights.”  Ante, at 13; see Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins,

578 U.S. 330, 341 (2016); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,

504 U.S. 555, 578 (1992); Warth, 422 U. S., at 500.  And Congress may protect those rights by authorizing suits not only for past harms but also for the material risk of future ones.  See Spokeo, 578 U. S., at 341–343; ante, at 15 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Under those precedents, this case should be easy.  In the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Congress determined to protect consumers’ reputations from inaccurate credit reporting.  TransUnion willfully violated that statute’s provisions by preparing credit files that falsely called the plaintiffs potential terrorists, and by obscuring that fact when the plaintiffs requested copies of their files.  To say, as the majority does, that the resulting injuries did not “ ‘exist’ in the real world” is to inhabit a world I don’t know.  Ante, at 10.  And to make that claim in the face of Congress’s contrary judgment is to exceed the judiciary’s “proper—and properly limited—role.”  Warth, 422 U. S., at 498; see ante, at 12–13 (Thomas, J., dissenting).

															I add a few words about the majority’s view of the risks of harm to the plaintiffs.  In addressing the claim that TransUnion failed to maintain accurate credit files, the majority argues that the “risk of dissemination” of the plaintiffs’ credit information to third parties is “too speculative.”  Ante, at 22.  But why is it so speculative that a company in the business of selling credit reports to third parties will in fact sell a credit report to a third party?  See also ante, at 15 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (noting that “nearly 25% of the class” already had false reports “sent to potential creditors”).  And in addressing the claims of faulty disclosure to the plaintiffs, the majority makes a set of curious assumptions.  According to the majority, people who specifically request a copy of their credit report may not even “open[ ] ” the envelope.  Ante, at 25 (emphasis in original).  And people who receive multiple opaque mailings are not likely to be “confused.”  Ibid.; but see Niz-Chavez v. Garland, 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 14) (explaining that a “series of letters,” “each containing a new morsel of vital information,” is likely to perplex recipients).  And finally, people who learn that their credit files label them potential terrorists would not “have tried to correct” the error.  Ante, at 25.  Rather than accept those suppositions, I sign up with Justice Thomas: “[O]ne need only tap into common sense to know that receiving a letter identifying you as a potential drug trafficker or terrorist is harmful.”  Ante, at 17.

															I differ with Justice Thomas on just one matter, unlikely to make much difference in practice.  In his view, any “violation of an individual right” created by Congress gives rise to Article III standing.  Ante, at 7.  But in Spokeo, this Court held that “Article III requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.”  578 U. S., at 341.  I continue to adhere to that view, but think it should lead to the same result as Justice Thomas’s approach in all but highly unusual cases.  As Spokeo recognized, “Congress is well positioned to identify [both tangible and] intangible harms” meeting Article III standards.  Ibid.  Article III requires for concreteness only a “real harm” (that is, a harm that “actually exist[s]”) or a “risk of real harm.”  Ibid.  And as today’s decision definitively proves, Congress is better suited than courts to determine when something causes a harm or risk of harm in the real world.  For that reason, courts should give deference to those congressional judgments.  Overriding an authorization to sue is appropriate when but only when Congress could not reasonably have thought that a suit will contribute to compensating or preventing the harm at issue.  Subject to that qualification, I join Justice Thomas’s dissent in full.
