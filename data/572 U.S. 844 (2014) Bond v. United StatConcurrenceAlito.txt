															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															CAROL ANNE BOND, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the third circuit

															[June 2, 2014]

															

															     Justice Alito,
concurring in the judgment.

															     As explained in Part I
of Justice Scalia’s concurring opinion, which I join,
petitioner’s conduct violated 18 U. S. C.
§229, the federal criminal statute under which she was
convicted. I therefore find it necessary to reach the question
whether this statute represents a constitutional exercise of
federal power, and as the case comes to us, the only possible
source of federal power to be considered is the treaty power.

															     For the reasons set out
in Parts I–III of Justice Thomas’ concurring opinion,
which I join, I believe that the treaty power is limited to
agreements that address matters of legitimate international
concern. The treaty pursuant to which §229 was enacted, the
Chemical Weapons Convention, is not self-executing, and thus the
Convention itself does not have domestic effect without
congressional action. The control of true chemical weapons, as that
term is customarily understood, is a matter of great international
concern, and therefore the heart of the Convention clearly
represents a valid exercise of the treaty power. But insofar as the
Convention may be read to obligate the United States to enact
domestic legislation criminalizing conduct of the sort at issue in
this case, which typically is the sort of conduct regulated by the
States, the Convention exceeds the scope of the treaty power.
Section 229 cannot be regarded as necessary and proper to carry
into execution the treaty power, and accordingly it lies outside
Congress’ reach unless supported by some other power
enumerated in the Constitution. The Government has presented no
such justification for this statute.

															     For these reasons, I
would reverse petitioner’s conviction on constitutional
grounds.
