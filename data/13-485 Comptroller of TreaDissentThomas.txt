															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY OF MARYLAND, PETITIONER v. BRIAN WYNNE et ux.

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of maryland

															[May 18, 2015]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins except as to the first paragraph, dissenting.

															“I continue to adhere to my view that the negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application, and, consequently, cannot serve as a basis for striking down a state statute.”  McBurney v. Young, 569 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted); accord, e.g., Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v. Town of Harrison,

520 U. S. 564
–612 (1997) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  For that reason, I would uphold Maryland’s tax scheme.

															In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Court proves just how far our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence has departed from the actual Commerce Clause.  According to the majority, a state income tax that fails to provide residents with “a full credit against the income taxes that they pay to other States” violates the Commerce Clause.  Ante, at 1.  That news would have come as a surprise to those who penned and ratified the Constitution.  As this Court observed some time ago, “Income taxes . . . were imposed by several of the States at or shortly after the adoption of the Federal Constitution.”  Shaffer v. Carter, 

252 U. S. 37,
51 (1920)
.[1]*  There is no indication that those early state income tax schemes provided credits for income taxes paid elsewhere.  Thus, under the majority’s reasoning, all of those state laws would have contravened the newly ratified Commerce Clause.

															It seems highly implausible that those who ratified the Commerce Clause understood it to conflict with the income tax laws of their States and nonetheless adopted it without a word of concern.  That silence is particularly deafening given the importance of such taxes for raising revenues at the time.  See Kinsman, The Income Tax in the Commonwealths of the United States 7, in 4 Publications of the American Economic Assn. (1903) (noting, for example, that “Connecticut from her earliest history had followed the plan of taxing incomes rather than property” and that “[t]he total assessed value of [taxable] incomes in Connecticut in the year 1795 was a little over $300,000” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

															In other areas of constitutional analysis, we would have considered these laws to be powerful evidence of the original understanding of the Constitution.  We have, for ex-ample, relied on the practices of the First Congress to guide our interpretation of provisions defining congressional power.  See, e.g., Golan v. Holder, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 16) (Copyright Clause); McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401–402 (1819) (Necessary and Proper Clause).  We have likewise treated “actions taken by the First Congress a[s] presumptively consistent with the Bill of Rights,”  Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 12).  See, e.g., id., at ___ – ___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 7–8); Carroll v. United States,

267 U. S. 132
–152 (1925). And we have looked to founding-era state laws to guide our understanding of the Constitution’s meaning.  See, e.g., District of Columbia v. Heller,

554 U. S. 570
–602 (2008) (
 
Second Amendment); Atwater v. Lago Vista,

532 U. S. 318
–340 (2001) (
 
Fourth Amendment); Roth v. United States,

354 U. S. 476
–483 (1957) (
 
First Amendment); Kilbourn v. Thompson,

103 U. S. 168
–203 (1881) (Speech and Debate Clause); see also Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 396–397 (1798) (opinion of Paterson, J.) (Ex Post Facto Clause).

															Even if one assumed that the negative Commerce Clause existed, I see no reason why it would be subject to a different mode of constitutional interpretation.  The majority quibbles that I fail to “sho[w] that the small number of individuals who earned income out of State were taxed twice on that income,” ante, at 28, but given the deference we owe to the duly enacted laws of a State—particularly those concerning the paradigmatically sovereign activity of taxation—the burden of proof falls on those who would wield the Federal Constitution to foreclose that exercise of sovereign power.    

															I am doubtful that the majority’s application of one of our many negative Commerce Clause tests is correct under our precedents, see ante, at 5–7 (Scalia, J., dissenting); post, at 10–19 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), but I am certain that the majority’s result is incorrect under our Constitution.  As was well said in another area of constitutional law: “[I]f there is any inconsistency between [our] tests and the historic practice . . . , the inconsistency calls into question the validity of the test, not the historic practice.”  Town of Greece, supra, at ___ (Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 12).

															I respectfully dissent.Notes
