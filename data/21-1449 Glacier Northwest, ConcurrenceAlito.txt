															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–1449

															_________________

															GLACIER NORTHWEST, INC., dba CALPORTLAND,
PETITIONER v. INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL
UNION NO. 174

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
washington

															[June 1, 2023]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas and
Justice Gorsuch join, concurring in the judgment.

															I agree with the Court that the Washington
Supreme Court erred in holding that Glacier Northwest’s
complaint is preempted under San Diego Building Trades
Council v. Garmon, 359 U.S.
236 (1959). The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects
the right to strike, but that right is subject to certain
limitations and qualifications, see 29 U. S. C.
§163, and this Court’s decisions make clear that the Act
does not protect striking employees who engage in the type of
conduct alleged here.

															This Court has long recognized that the Act does
not “invest those who go on strike with an immunity from
discharge for acts of trespass or violence against the
employer’s property.” NLRB v. Fansteel
Metallurgical Corp., 306 U.S.
240, 255 (1939). To justify “despoiling [an
employer’s] property” or “the seizure and
conversion of its goods,” we have reasoned, “would be
to put a premium on resort to force instead of legal
remedies.” Id., at 253. It follows that Garmon
preemption does not prevent States from imposing liability on
employees who intentionally destroy their employer’s
property. See, e.g., Machinists v. Wisconsin
Employment Relations Comm’n, 427
U.S. 132, 136 (1976) (“Policing . . .
destruction of property has been held most clearly a matter for the
States”); Construction Workers v. Laburnum Constr.
Corp., 347 U.S.
656, 669 (1954) (The NLRA does not allow employees to
“destroy property without liability for the damage
done”); Electrical Workers v. Wisconsin Employment
Relations Bd., 315 U.S.
740, 748 (1942) (The NLRA “was not designed to preclude a
State” from regulating threats of property damage); see also
Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U.S.
53, 61–62 (1966) (“ ‘[T]here is no
ground for concluding that existing criminal penalties or
liabilities for tortious conduct have been
eliminated’ ” by the NLRA); Bill
Johnson’s Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U.S.
731, 741–742 (1983) (“It has . . .
repeatedly been held that an employer has the right to seek local
judicial protection from tortious conduct during a labor
dispute”).

															Nothing more is needed to resolve this case.
Glacier’s complaint alleges that the Union and its members
acted “with the improper purpose to harm Glacier by causing
[its] batched concrete to be destroyed.” App. 10; accord,
id., at 14, 19–20. As the Court recognizes, they
succeeded by “prompt[ing] the creation of the perishable
product” and then ceasing work when the concrete was in a
vulnerable state. Ante, at 10 (emphasis deleted); see App.
10–13. Because this Court has long rejected the Union’s
claim that this kind of conduct is protected, Garmon
preemption does not apply. See Longshoremen v. Davis,
476 U.S.
380, 395 (1986).[1]

Notes
1
 The Court wisely declines
to address the argument on which Justice Jackson relies regarding
the effect of the complaint before the NLRB on this litigation. See
post, at 7–8. That argument represents a striking
extension of Garmon preemption, which, as the Court notes,
is already an “unusual” doctrine. See ante, at
3–4. If the state courts on remand dismiss this case on that
ground, the decision, in my judgment, would be a good candidate for
a quick return trip here.
