															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															LANELL WILLIAMS-YULEE, PETITIONER v.THE FLORIDA BAR
															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of florida
															[April 29, 2015]
															                    Justice Breyer, concurring.
															                    As I have previously said, I view this Court’s doctrine referring to tiers of scrutiny as guidelines informing our approach to the case at hand, not tests to be mechanically applied.  See, e.g., United States v. Alvarez, 567 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1–3); Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC,528 U. S. 377–403 (2000) (Breyer, J., concurring).  On that understanding, I join the Court’s opinion.
