															TYSON TIMBS, PETITIONER v. INDIANA

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of indiana

															[February 20, 2019]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, concurring.

															The majority faithfully applies our precedent and, based on a wealth of historical evidence, concludes that the
 
Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the
 
Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause against the States.  I  agree with that conclusion.  As an original matter, I acknowledge, the appropriate vehicle for incorporation may well be the
 
Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities Clause, rather than, as this Court has long assumed, the Due Process Clause.  See, e.g., post, at 1–3 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); McDonald v. Chicago,

561 U.S. 742, 805–858 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (documenting evidence that the “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States” include, at minimum, the individual rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights); Wildenthal, Nationalizing the Bill of Rights: Revisiting the Original Understanding of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment in 1866–67, 68 Ohio St. L. J. 1509 (2007); A. Amar, The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 163–214 (1998); M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: The
 
Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights (1986).  But nothing in this case turns on that question, and, regardless of the precise vehicle, there can be no serious doubt that the
 
Fourteenth Amendment requires the States to respect the freedom from excessive fines enshrined in the
 
Eighth Amendment.
