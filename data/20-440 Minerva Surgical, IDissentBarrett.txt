															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															MINERVA SURGICAL, INC., PETITIONER v. HOLOGIC, INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[June 29, 2021]

															

															Justice Barrett, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting.

															The Patent Act of 1952 sets forth a comprehensive scheme for the creation and protection of patent rights.  But it nowhere mentions the equitable doctrine of assignor estoppel, which precludes inventors who file patent applications from later saying that the patent is invalid.  To the contrary, where the Act does address invalidity defenses, it states that invalidity “shall” be a defense “in any action involving the validity or infringement of a patent.”

35 U. S. C. §282(b).  The text includes no exception for actions in which the inventor is the defendant.

															So why the doctrine of assignor estoppel?  Because in Westinghouse Elec. & Mfg. Co. v. Formica Insulation Co.,

266 U.S. 342 (1924), we interpreted a predecessor statute, the Patent Act of 1870, to incorporate the doctrine.  The question before us is whether the doctrine carried over into the Patent Act of 1952.  That could have happened in one of two ways: (1) if Congress ratified Westinghouse when it reenacted the assignment provision in 1952, or (2) if assignor estoppel was part of the well-settled common-law backdrop against which Congress legislated in 1952.  The Court opts for the second theory, but in my view, neither works.

															I

															I will take the possibility of congressional ratification first because it follows more naturally from Westinghouse.  In that case, the Court did not present the doctrine of assignor estoppel as a well-established background principle against which Congress legislated when it enacted the Patent Act of 1870.[1]  Nor could it have: The first American case to apply the doctrine was not decided until 1880.  See Faulks v. Kamp, 3 F. 898 (CC SDNY).  Instead, the Westinghouse Court identified assignor estoppel as a rule that made sense in light of the Act’s assignment provision.  After examining the text of the provision, the Court explained: “[T]here seems to be no reason why the principles of estoppel by deed should not apply to assignment of a patent right in accordance with the statute,” because “[i]t was manifestly intended by Congress to surround the conveyance of patent property with safeguards resembling those usually attaching to that of land.”  266 U. S., at 348–349.  Some lower courts had applied the doctrine to the assignment and conveyance of patents, and, giving that trend its blessing, the Court described assignor estoppel as a sensible gloss on the assignment provision of the 1870 Act.  Id., at 349–350.[2]

															The question here is whether Congress embraced this gloss when it reenacted that provision in 1952.  Congress ratifies a judicial interpretation in a reenacted statute only if two requirements are satisfied: (1) the interpretation must be so well settled that we can “presume Congress knew of and endorsed it” at the time of the reenactment, and (2) the statute must be reenacted without material change.  Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,

543 U.S. 335, 349, 351 (2005); Forest Grove School Dist. v. T. A.,

557 U.S. 230, 239–240 (2009); see also Lamar, Archer & Cofrin, LLP v. Appling, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 11) (noting that Congress incorporates a prior judicial interpretation of a statute when it uses “the materially same language” and the interpretation is “longstanding”); W. Eskridge, Interpreting Law: A Primer on How to Read Statutes and the Constitution 421–422 (2016) (“When Congress reenacts a statute, it incorporates settled interpretations of the reenacted statute.  The rule is inapplicable when there is no settled standard Congress could have known or the re-enactment makes a material change in the text” (footnote omitted)).  So here, respondents must persuade us that (1) as of 1952, Westinghouse’s construction of the assignment provision in the Patent Act of 1870 was well settled, and (2) the assignment provision in the Patent Act of 1952 is materially identical to the 1870 version.  Jama, 543 U. S., at 349.  They cannot clear either hurdle.[3]

															A

															Westinghouse’s construction of the assignment provision in the Patent Act of 1870 was far from well settled in 1952.  Indeed, it is difficult to describe Westinghouse itself as much more than a “mild endorsement of assignor estoppel.”  Brief for Petitioner 20.  While accepting the doctrine, the Court simultaneously declined to apply it.  Westinghouse, 266 U. S., at 355 (holding that an assignor could use prior art to narrow the patent claims); cf. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10 (“This Court has never actually applied assignor estoppel in a case before it”).  Still, if Westinghouse had been the last word on assignor estoppel, one might argue that it set forth a statement of a stable principle.

															But Westinghouse was not the last word on assignor estoppel.  The next time we considered the doctrine, we backpedaled.  See Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Mfg. Co.,

326 U.S. 249 (1945).  Deeming Westinghouse’s analysis a “logical embarrassment,” we carved out an exception plainly inconsistent with the general rule of assignor estoppel: that it does not apply to an assignor who contests a patent’s validity by invoking an expired patent.  326 U. S., at 253, 256–257.  We also cast doubt on the continuing validity of the doctrine, expressly declining to address the extent to which assignor estoppel “may be deemed to have survived the [Westinghouse] decision or to be restricted by it.”  Id., at 254.  The dissent, for its part, claimed that the Court had “repudiated judicially” assignor estoppel altogether.  Id., at 264 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.); see also Edward Katzinger Co. v. Chicago Metallic Mfg. Co.,

329 U.S. 394, 400 (1947) (describing Scott Paper as holding that an assignor could “challenge the validity” of a patent and “defeat an action for infringement”).

															So when Congress reenacted the Patent Act in 1952, assignor estoppel was far from well settled—if anything, it was on life support.  Respondents could muster only three cases in the seven years after Scott Paper (before Congress reenacted the Patent Act) even loosely suggesting support for the doctrine.  See Brief for Respondents 6.  Indeed, rather than embracing assignor estoppel after Scott Paper, courts questioned the doctrine’s validity.  See, e.g., Douglass v. United States Appliance Corp., 177 F.2d 98, 101 (CA9 1949).  Scholars did the same; some, like the dissent in Scott Paper, concluded that we had “wipe[d] out estoppel by assignment.”  Lechner, Estoppel Against Patent Assignors—The Scott Paper Company Case, 28 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 325, 330 (1946).  Others concluded that the law was a mess.  As one scholar put it: Westinghouse’s rule “has become so unsettled during the past forty years of judicial consideration that, today, some courts apparently consider the rule to be no longer valid, others find no weakening of the rule, while still other courts apply the rule only after considerable speculation as to its continued validity.”  Cooper, Estoppel To Challenge Patent Validity: The Case of Private Good Faith vs. Public Policy, 18 W. Res. L. Rev. 1122, 1123 (1967) (footnotes omitted; emphasis added).

															Post-1952 judicial decisions addressing assignor estoppel supply yet more evidence that the status of the doctrine was (at best) uncertain when Congress reenacted the Patent Act.  In Lear, Inc. v. Adkins,

395 U.S. 653 (1969), for example, we disavowed the closely related doctrine of licensee estoppel, noting along the way that the exception articulated in Scott Paper had “undermined the very basis of the ‘general rule’ ” of assignor estoppel.  395 U. S., at 666.  And following Lear, several lower courts concluded that assignor estoppel was not just unsettled but, like licensee estoppel, dead.  See, e.g., Coastal Dynamics Corp. v. Symbolic Displays, Inc., 469 F.2d 79 (CA9 1972).

															Tellingly, respondents could not come up with even one case applying assignor estoppel in the nearly 20-year period from Lear until the Federal Circuit resurrected the doctrine in 1988.  See Diamond Scientific Co. v. Ambico, Inc., 848 F.2d 1220, 1224–1225.  And when the Federal Circuit resurrected the doctrine, even it acknowledged that we had left the vitality of assignor estoppel unsettled: “Although the Supreme Court has examined th[e] doctrine . . . its opinions have hardly been definite or definitive.”  Id., at 1222.

															Given all this, it is hard to see how we can “presume Congress knew of and endorsed” the doctrine when it adopted a new version of the Patent Act in 1952.  Jama, 543 U. S., at 349.  That is so even if a technical parsing of Scott Paper finds that it left assignor estoppel not quite dead, but ever-so-faintly breathing.  In this circumstance, it would be strange to conclude that the vitality of assignor estoppel was so “unquestioned,” 543 U. S., at 349, that Congress would have “regard[ed] the point as settled law,” A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 325 (2012).  On the contrary, the law was anything but clear.

															Today’s opinion confirms as much.  Although the Court endorses assignor estoppel, it does not apply the doctrine as Westinghouse described it.  Westinghouse stated the “rule” of assignor estoppel this way: “[A]n assignor of a patent right is estopped to attack the utility, novelty or validity of a patented invention which he has assigned or granted as against any one claiming the right under his assignment or grant.”  266 U. S., at 349.  The Court describes assignor estoppel much more narrowly: “The doctrine applies only when an inventor says one thing (explicitly or implicitly) in assigning a patent and the opposite in litigating against the patent’s owner.”  Ante, at 5.  This version of assignor estoppel does not appear in Westinghouse—nor, to my knowledge, in any other judicial decision.  The new version might be preferable to the old, but if Congress truly had ratified Westinghouse, it would have endorsed the Westinghouse version.

															B

															The reenactment canon has a second requirement: The reenacted statute must be materially identical to the one previously interpreted.[4]  This poses another stumbling block for assignor estoppel, because the assignment provision of the 1952 Act contains a significant sentence that the 1870 Act did not: “Subject to the provisions of this title, patents shall have the attributes of personal property.”[5]  Patent Act of 1952, §261,

66Stat.
810 (emphasis added).  Given the reasoning of Westinghouse, this is a material change.

															Westinghouse grounded its approval of assignor estoppel in the idea that patents are like real property.  After observing that the assignment provision required an assignment to be made in writing and recorded in the Patent Office within three months, the Court stated that “there seems to be no reason why the principles of estoppel by deed should not apply to assignment of a patent right in accordance with the statute.”  266 U. S., at 348–349.  After all, the purpose of the writing-and-recording requirement is to “furnish written and recorded evidence of title and to protect the purchaser of the title as recorded for value without notice.”  Id., at 349.  Thus, the Court concluded, “[i]t was manifestly intended by Congress to surround the conveyance of patent property with safeguards” that resemble “those usually attaching to that of land.”  Ibid.

															But this analogy was inapt from the start.  Even Westinghouse admitted that deeds and patents differed in an important respect: “A tract of land is easily determined by survey.  Not so the scope of a patent right for an invention.”  Id., at 350.  Moreover, unlike the grantor of a deed, who guarantees the quality of title, an assignor of a patent cannot warrant a patent’s validity.  The validity of a patent involves a factual and legal inquiry “predicated on factors as to which reasonable men can differ widely.”  Lear, 395 U. S., at 670; see Stanford, Diamond Scientific Co. v. Ambico, Inc.: Enforcing Patent Assignor Estoppel, 26 Houston L. Rev. 761, 766 (1989) (“Since validity is never contractually transferred in an assignment, there is no theoretical basis for assignor estoppel by deed” (footnote omitted)).

															In any event, however persuasive we found the patent-deed analogy in Westinghouse, the Patent Act of 1952 unraveled it.  When Congress reenacted the assignment provision, it specified that patents have “the attributes of personal property.”

66Stat.
810 (emphasis added).  Because this language is inconsistent with the premise on which Westinghouse rested, it undercuts the argument that Congress ratified Westinghouse in the new assignment provision.  Cf. Holder v. Martinez Gutierrez,

566 U.S. 583, 593 (2012) (concluding that a reenacted provision did not ratify a prior judicial construction where the provision lacked the word on which the earlier construction was based).

															Respondents try to brush off the change as insignificant, asserting that this “sentence has no bearing on assignor estoppel anyway, because estoppel by deed, upon which assignor estoppel is based, can apply to real or personal property.”  Brief for Respondents 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But whatever the scope of estoppel by deed—respondents do not elaborate—Westinghouse expressly rested on “[t]he analogy between estoppel in conveyances of land and estoppel in assignments of a patent right.”  266 U. S., at 350 (emphasis added).  In the one case, a “grantor purports to convey the right to exclude others . . . from a defined tract of land, and in the other, from a described and limited field of the useful arts.”  Ibid.  By making clear that patents have “the attributes of personal property,” Congress directly undermined an interpretation that treated patents like deeds conveying land.

															II

															If Congress did not ratify our gloss on the assignment provision in the 1952 Act, how else might assignor estoppel be part of the statute?  The Court comes at the interpretive problem from a different angle: It holds that by 1952, assignor estoppel had become “a background principle of patent adjudication” against which Congress legislated.  Ante, at 10.  On this theory, Westinghouse is important not for its interpretation of the assignment provision but for the equitable principle that it endorsed.  In my view, this theory also fails because Westinghouse proved to be a false start for the doctrine.

															We have said that “where a common-law principle is well established, . . . courts may take it as given that Congress has legislated with an expectation that the principle will apply” absent statutory cues to the contrary.  Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino,

501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991); see also Eskridge, Interpreting Law, at 348 (“[C]ourts will assume that legislatures act against the background of the common law”).  So, for example, a federal statute of limitations ordinarily is subject to equitable tolling even when the text is silent because “Congress must be presumed to draft limitations periods in light of this background principle.”  Young v. United States,

535 U.S. 43, 49–50 (2002); see also Nelson, Statutory Interpretation, at 629 (“[C]ourts frequently understand federal statutes to come with some unstated qualifications or embellishments suggested by principles of general jurisprudence”).

															The Court says that assignor estoppel works this way too.  Ante, at 10.  True, the Patent Act provides that “[i]nvalidity of the patent shall be a defense[ ] in any action involving” infringement.  Ibid. (quoting

35 U. S. C. §282(b); internal quotation marks and some alterations omitted).  Yet, the Court reasons, this apparently absolute language does not “foreclose applying in patent cases a whole host of common-law preclusion doctrines,” including “equitable estoppel, collateral estoppel, res judicata, and law of the case.”  Ante, at 10.  Assignor estoppel, the Court says, falls in that same category.  Ibid.  According to the Court, Westinghouse confirmed a trend that had already begun in the lower courts and has continued unabated since, giving assignor estoppel a place in the pantheon of well-established common-law principles.

															I disagree.  The common-law pedigree of assignor estoppel differs markedly from that of the preclusion doctrines with which the Court groups it.  Some of those doctrines have been around for nearly a thousand years, see, e.g., Bursak, Note, Preclusions, 91 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1651, 1663 (2016) (“Res judicata had migrated to England no later than the early 1100s”); Millar, The Historical Relation of Estoppel by Record to Res Judicata, 35 Ill. L. Rev. 41, 44–45 (1940) (res judicata and collateral estoppel go back to at least the 1200s), and were far more settled in early American courts, see, e.g., Washington, Alexandria, & Georgetown Steam-Packet Co. v. Sickles, 24 How. 333, 341 (1861) (“The authority of the res judicata . . . is derived by us from the Roman law and the Canonists”); Hopkins v. Lee, 6 Wheat. 109, 114 (1821) (stating that collateral estoppel has “found its way into every system of jurisprudence”).  They are firmly rooted in our jurisprudence now.

															Assignor estoppel, by contrast, has far from this kind of “impeccable historic pedigree.”  Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,

568 U.S. 519, 538 (2013).  It is more recent and far shakier.  It was introduced into patent law in the late 19th century—about a hundred years after Congress enacted the first patent laws and a decade after Congress passed the 1870 Act.  See Faulks v. Kamp, 3 F. 898 (CC SDNY 1880); ante, at 6 (opinion of the Court).  And after its introduction, it lacked staying power.  Westinghouse proved to be the “high-water mark of the doctrine in this Court.”  Brief for Petitioner 20.  As I have already explained, lower courts, commentators, the Scott Paper dissent, and even the Court itself in Lear regarded Scott Paper as having gutted the doctrine of assignor estoppel.  See supra, at 4–6.

															It is therefore difficult for me to see how, in 1952, assignor estoppel constituted a “long-established and familiar principl[e]” like res judicata.  Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson,

343 U.S. 779, 783 (1952).  At most, the doctrine of assignor estoppel was in a confused state by 1952—a far cry from the high bar that we have required to incorporate “well-settled” common-law background principles into a statute.  See, e.g., Kirtsaeng, 568 U. S., at 538 (noting the first-sale doctrine’s “impeccable historic pedigree”); Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez,

572 U.S. 1, 10 (2014) (emphasizing that equitable tolling is a “long-established feature of American jurisprudence”).  Indeed, whatever one might have said when the Court decided Westinghouse in 1924, Scott Paper cut sharply in the other direction.  And such “contradictory signals are not typically the stuff of which background rules of common law are made.”  B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Industries, Inc.,

575 U.S. 138, 163 (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting).

															III

															Respondents insist that assignor estoppel promotes fair dealing, while petitioner protests that the supposedly equitable doctrine is actually inequitable in practice.  If we had authority to develop federal common law on the subject, we could take sides in that debate.  But no one contends that we do.  This case turns on whether the Patent Act of 1952 incorporates the doctrine, and because it does not, I respectfully dissent.
Notes
1
 I do not understand the Court to have a contrary view—its position is that assignor estoppel had become a well-established background principle of patent adjudication by the time Congress enacted the Patent Act of 1952.  Ante, at 10.  I address this possibility in Part II, infra. 

2
 Justice Alito maintains that Westinghouse did not interpret the statute because it made no effort to parse the text.  Ante, at 2–3 (dissenting opinion).  But whatever the decision’s merits, it plainly grounded assignor estoppel in the statute’s assignment provision.  See Westinghouse, 266 U. S., at 348–349. 

3
 Justice Alito suggests that the reenactment canon has no application when this Court, as opposed to lower courts, has interpreted the prior version of a statute.  Ante, at 3–4.  He is mistaken.  As a leading treatise explains, the canon has its most obvious application when a “court of last resort” interprets a statute, though it “applies as well to uniform holdings of lower courts and even to well-established agency interpretations.”  A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 323–324 (2012) (footnote omitted); see also C. Nelson, Statutory Interpretation 479 (2011) (noting that the canon applies when “[t]he Supreme Court (or a critical mass of lower courts, or an agency that Congress has put in charge of administering the statute) adopt[s] a prominent interpretation of one of the statute’s provisions”); Forest Grove School Dist. v. T. A.,

557 U.S. 230, 239 (2009) (applying the canon to a statute that we had previously interpreted and that Congress had reenacted without material change); Shapiro v. United States,

335 U.S. 1, 16, 20 (1948) (same).  To be sure, there is a practical difference between the canon’s application to this Court and lower courts: It takes a “uniform and sufficiently numerous” body of lower court decisions to satisfy the presumption of congressional notice, whereas a single decision of this Court can be enough.  Scalia, Reading Law, at 325; see, e.g., Forest Grove, 557 U. S., at 239; Manhattan Properties, Inc. v. Irving Trust Co.,

291 U.S. 320, 336 (1934); cf. BP p.l.c. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 11).  But if a decision of this Court is oblique or thrown into doubt by subsequent precedent—both of which are true here—we have no basis for presuming that Congress was on notice of and endorsed our position.  See Forest Grove, 557 U. S., at 239. 

4
 Justice Alito argues that the “material change” standard requires “express language” or “unavoidably implied contradiction.”  Ante, at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).  He draws this heightened standard from an entirely different canon—the presumption that a later enacted statute does not impliedly repeal a former one.  See ibid.; Scalia, Reading Law, at 327–333 (describing the “Presumption Against Implied Repeal”).  As for the canon applicable here—the reenactment canon—our precedents do not support Justice Alito’s proposed standard.  See, e.g., Lorillard v. Pons,

434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978) (“Congress is presumed to be aware of [a] judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change”); Forest Grove, 557 U. S., at 239–240 (same); see also Lamar, Archer & Cofrin, LLP v. Appling, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 11) (Congress is presumed to be aware of a prior judicial interpretation of a statute when it uses “the materially same language” in a subsequent statute).  The implied repeal canon addresses a different situation: when a court interprets two different and arguably conflicting statutory provisions.  Scalia, Reading Law, at 331.

 The Patent Act of 1870 provides, in relevant part: “[E]very patent or any interest therein shall be assignable in law, by an instrument in writing; and the patentee or his assigns or legal representatives may, in like manner, grant and convey an exclusive right under his patent to the whole or any specified part of the United States; and said assignment, grant, or conveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, without notice, unless it is recorded in the patent office within three months from the date thereof.”  §36,

16Stat.
203; see Westinghouse, 266 U. S., at 348 (citing to the revised version of the 1870 Act, “§4898”).
