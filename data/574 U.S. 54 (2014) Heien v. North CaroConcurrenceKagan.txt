															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															NICHOLAS BRADY HEIEN, PETITIONER v. NORTH CAROLINA

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of north carolina

															[December 15, 2014]

															Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.

															I concur in full in the Courtâ€™s opinion,
which explains why certain mistakes of law can support the
reasonable suspicion needed to stop a vehicle under the Fourth
Amendment. In doing so, the Court correctly emphasizes that the
â€œ Fourth Amendment tolerates only
.Â .Â . objectively
reasonableâ€ mistakes of law. Ante, at 11. And
the Court makes clear that the inquiry into whether an
officerâ€™s mistake of law counts as objectively
reasonable â€œis not as forgiving as the one
employed in the distinct context of deciding whether an officer is
entitled to qualified immunity.â€ Ibid. I write
separately to elaborate briefly on those important
limitations.[1]

															First, an officerâ€™s
â€œsubjective understandingâ€ is
irrelevant: As the Court notes, â€œ[w]e do not
examineâ€ it at all. Ibid. That means the
government cannot defend an officerâ€™s mistaken
legal interpretation on the ground that the officer was unaware of
or untrained in the law. And it means that, contrary to the
dissenting opinion in the court below, an
officerâ€™s reliance on â€œan
incorrect memo or training program from the police
departmentâ€ makes no difference to the analysis. 366
N.Â C. 271, 284, 737 S.Â E. 2d 351, 360
(2012) (Hudson, J., dissenting). Those considerations pertain to
the officerâ€™s subjective understanding of the
law and thus cannot help to justify a seizure.

															Second, the inquiry the Court permits today is more demanding
than the one courts undertake before awarding qualified immunity.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 51 (Solicitor General stating that the two
tests â€œrequire essentially the
oppositeâ€ showings); Brief for Respondent
31â€“32 (making a similar point). Our modern
qualified immunity doctrine protects â€œall but
the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the
law.â€ Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563
U.Â S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12) (quoting
Malley v. Briggs,475 U.Â S. 335,341
(1986)). By contrast, Justice Storyâ€™s opinion in
The Friendship, 9 F.Â Cas. 825, 826 (No. 5,125)
(CC Mass. 1812) (cited ante, at 7), suggests the appropriate
standard for deciding when a legal error can support a seizure:
when an officer takes a reasonable view of a
â€œvexata questioâ€ on which different
judges â€œh[o]ld opposite opinions.â€
See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26 (invoking
that language). Or to make the same point without the Latin, the
test is satisfied when the law at issue is â€œso
doubtful in constructionâ€ that a reasonable judge could
agree with the officerâ€™s view. The
Friendship, 9 F.Â Cas., at 826.

															A court tasked with deciding whether an
officerâ€™s mistake of law can support a seizure
thus faces a straightforward question of statutory construction. If
the statute is genuinely ambiguous, such that overturning the
officerâ€™s judgment requires hard interpretive
work, then the officer has made a reasonable mistake. But if not,
not. As the Solicitor General made the point at oral argument, the
statute must pose a â€œreally
difficultâ€ or â€œvery hard question of
statutory interpretation.â€ Tr. of Oral Arg. 50. And
indeed, both North Carolina and the Solicitor General agreed that
such cases will be â€œexceedingly
rare.â€ Brief for Respondent 17; Tr. of Oral Arg.
48.

															The Courtâ€™s analysis of Sergeant
Darisseâ€™s interpretation of the North Carolina
law at issue here appropriately reflects these principles. As the
Court explains, see ante, at
12â€“13, the statute requires every car on
the highway to have â€œa stop lamp,â€
in the singular. N.Â C. Gen. Stat. Ann.
Â§20â€“129(g) (2007). But the statute
goes on to state that a stop lamp (or, in more modern terminology,
brake light) â€œmay be incorporated into a unit
with one or more other rear lamps,â€ suggesting
that a stop lamp itself qualifies as a rear lamp. Ibid.
(emphasis added). And the statute further mandates that every car
have â€œall originally equipped rear lamps
.Â .Â . in good working order.â€
Â§20â€“129(d) (emphasis added). The
North Carolina Court of Appeals dealt with the
statuteâ€™s conflicting signals in one way
(deciding that a brake light is not a rear lamp, and so only
one needs to work); but a court could easily take the
officerâ€™s view (deciding that a brake light
is a rear lamp, and if a car comes equipped with more than
one, as modern cars do, all must be in working order). The critical
point is that the statute poses a quite difficult question of
interpretation, and Sergeant Darisseâ€™s judgment,
although overturned, had much to recommend it. I therefore agree
with the Court that the traffic stop he conducted did not violate
the Fourth Amendment.

Notes
1Â I note in addition, as does
the Court, that one kind of mistaken legal
judgmentâ€”an error about the contours of the
Fourth Amendment itselfâ€”can never support a
search or seizure. See ante, at 10 (â€œAn
officerâ€™s mistaken view thatâ€
conduct does â€œnot give rise
toâ€ a Fourth Amendment violation,
â€œno matter how reasonable,â€ cannot
change a courtâ€™s â€œultimate
conclusionâ€ that such a violation has occurred). As the
Solicitor General has explained, mistakes about the requirements of
the Fourth Amendment â€œviolate the Fourth
Amendment even when they are reasonable.â€ Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 30, n.Â 3; see
Brief for Respondent 29 (stating the same view).
