U.S. Supreme Court
United States v. Hamilton, 3 U.S. 3
Dall. 17 17 (1795)
United States v.
Hamilton
3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 17
The prisoner had been committed upon
the warrant of the district judge of Pennsylvania, charging him
with high treason, and being now brought into court upon a habeas
corpus, Lewis alleged that there was not the slightest ground for
the accusation brought against the prisoner, who had been committed
without ever having been heard and without knowing the name of any
witness that had been examined or the scope of any deposition that
had been taken against him, and he moved that the prisoner should
either be discharged absolutely or at least upon reasonable
bail.

U. S. 18
The Court, after holding the subject
for some days under advisement, directed the prisoner to be
admitted to bail, himself in the sum of $4,000 dollars, and two
sureties each in the sum of $2,000.
WILSON, J.
The recognizance must be taken for the
defendant's appearance at the next stated circuit court. The motion
for appointing a special circuit court to try offenses of this
description at a place nearer to the scene in which they occurred,
has not escaped our attention, and with a wish, if possible, to
grant it we have viewed the subject in every light, but hitherto
the difficulties are apparently insurmountable. We will, however,
state the principal ones, that the counsel may, if they please,
endeavour to remove them.
1. The next stated circuit court is so
near that it will not be possible to commence and finish the
business of the trials for treason at a special court to be
previously held, and it is very questionable whether we can appoint
a special circuit court at a distant period to overleap the session
of the stated court. The impropriety of such an interference is the
more striking when it is recollected that the circuit court itself,
as well as the Supreme Court, has a power to appoint a special
sessions for the trial of criminal causes. I Vol., s. 4, p.
51.
2. But even if a special court were to
be appointed to be held at a distant period, overleaping the stated
circuit court, could an indictment found at the latter be
prosecuted and tried at the former? There is a provision
"that all business depending for trial
at any special court shall, at the close thereof, be considered as
of course removed to the next stated term of the circuit
court."
2 Vol. Swift's Edit., s. 3., p. 227.
But there is no power given to remit to a special court the
business depending for trial before the stated circuit
court.
3. And suppose a special circuit court
were to be appointed previously to the stated court, could both be
in session at the same time? Or could two grand juries be
empanelled at the same time for the same district and both be
qualified to present all the offences (including, of course, the
offenses of treason) committed within their
jurisdiction.
