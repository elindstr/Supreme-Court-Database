Labor Board v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co.
No. 188
Argued February 3, 1942
Decided February 16, 1942
315 U.S. 282

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

															Findings of the Labor Board sustained as supported by substantial evidence.  P.  315 U. S. 282.

															116 F.2d 350 reversed.

															Certiorari, 314 U.S. 596, to review a judgment setting aside an order of the National Labor Relations Board, 13 N.L.R.B. 338, ordering the company to cease and desist from unfair labor practices; to cease giving effect to a contract with an "inside" union; to withdraw recognition from, and to disestablish, that union; to reinstate with backpay three discharged employees, and to post notices, etc.  A provision of the order for reimbursement of certain Government relief agencies was abandoned by the Board.

															PER CURIAM.

															Upon examination of the record, the Court concludes that the Board's findings are supported by substantial evidence.  Labor Board v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U. S. 584; Westinghouse Electric & Mfg. Co. v. Labor Board, 312 U.S. 660.  The judgment is therefore reversed with directions to enforce the Board's order in full, but with the modification proposed by the Board to conform to the decision in Republic Steel Corp. v. Labor Board, 311 U.S. 
															Page 315 U. S. 283
															 7.  THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS are of opinion that the order as modified should be enforced except with respect to the alleged discriminatory discharges of Warner, Jr., and Jordan, which they think are without the support of substantial evidence.

															Reversed, with directions.

															MR. JUSTICE JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
