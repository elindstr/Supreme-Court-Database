JOHANNS V. LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSN.
544 U. S. ____ (2005)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NOS. 03-1164 AND 03-1165

															MIKE JOHANNS, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE,
et al., PETITIONERS

															03–1164   v.
LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSOCIATION
et al.
NEBRASKA CATTLEMEN, INC., et al.,
PETITIONERS

															03–1165   v.
LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSOCIATION
et al.
on writs of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eighth circuit
[May 23, 2005]
   Justice Ginsburg,
concurring in the judgment.

															   I resist ranking the promotional
messages funded under the Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985,
7 U. S. C. §2901 et seq., but not attributed to
the Government, as government speech, given the message the Govern-
ment conveys in its own name. See, e.g., U. S. Dept. of
Health and Human Services and U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Dietary
Guidelines for Americans 2005, pp. 69, 30, available at
http://www.healthierus.gov/dietaryguidelines/ dga2005/document (as
visited May 18, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court’s case
file) (noting that “[t]rans fatty acids … are
present in foods that come from ruminant animals (e.g.,
cattle and sheep)” and recommending that Americans
“[l]imit intake of fats and oils high in saturated and/or
trans fatty acids”); post, at 9, n. 7
(Souter, J., dissenting). I remain persuaded, however, that the
assessments in these cases, as in United States v.
United Foods, Inc., 533 U. S. 405 (2001),
and Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott,
Inc., 521 U. S.
457 (1997), qualify as permissible economic regulation. See
United Foods, 533 U. S., at 425 (Breyer, J., dissenting).
For that reason, I concur in the judgment.
