															VIKING RIVER CRUISES, INC., PETITIONER v. ANGIE MORIANA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of california, second appellate district

															[June 15, 2022]

															

															Justice Thomas, dissenting.

															I continue to adhere to the view that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA),

9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., does not apply to proceedings in state courts.  See Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,

513 U.S. 265, 285–297 (1995) (Thomas, J., dissenting); see also Kindred Nursing Centers L. P. v. Clark,

581 U.S. 246, 257 (2017) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  Accordingly, the FAA does not require California’s courts to enforce an arbitration agreement that forbids an employee to invoke the State’s Private Attorneys General Act.  On that basis, I would affirm the judgment of the California Court of Appeal.
