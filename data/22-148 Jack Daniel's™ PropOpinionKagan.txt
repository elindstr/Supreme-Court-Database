															JACK DANIEL’S PROPERTIES, INC.,
PETITIONER v. VIP PRODUCTS LLC

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 8, 2023]

															

															Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															This case is about dog toys and whiskey, two
items seldom appearing in the same sentence. Respondent VIP
Products makes a squeaky, chewable dog toy designed to look like a
bottle of Jack Daniel’s whiskey. Though not entirely. On the
toy, for example, the words “Jack Daniel’s”
become “Bad Spaniels.” And the descriptive phrase
“Old No. 7 Brand Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey” turns
into “The Old No. 2 On Your Tennessee Carpet.” The
jokes did not impress petitioner Jack Daniel’s Properties. It
owns trademarks in the distinctive Jack Daniel’s bottle and
in many of the words and graphics on the label. And it believed Bad
Spaniels had both infringed and diluted those trademarks. Bad
Spaniels had infringed the marks, the argument ran, by leading
consumers to think that Jack Daniel’s had created, or was
otherwise responsible for, the dog toy. And Bad Spaniels had
diluted the marks, the argument went on, by associating the famed
whiskey with, well, dog excrement.

															The Court of Appeals, in the decision we review,
saw things differently. Though the federal trademark statute makes
infringement turn on the likelihood of consumer confusion, the
Court of Appeals never got to that issue. On the court’s
view, the First Amendment compels a stringent threshold test when
an infringement suit challenges a so-called expressive
work—here (so said the court), the Bad Spaniels toy. And that
test knocked out Jack Daniel’s claim, whatever the likelihood
of confusion. Likewise, Jack’s dilution claim
failed—though on that issue the problem was statutory. The
trademark law provides that the “noncommercial” use of
a mark cannot count as dilution. 15 U. S. C.
§1125(c)(3)(C). The Bad Spaniels marks, the court held, fell
within that exemption because the toy communicated a
message—a kind of parody—about Jack Daniel’s.

															Today, we reject both conclusions. The
infringement issue is the more substantial. In addressing it, we do
not decide whether the threshold inquiry applied in the Court of
Appeals is ever warranted. We hold only that it is not appropriate
when the accused infringer has used a trademark to designate the
source of its own goods—in other words, has used a trademark
as a trademark. That kind of use falls within the heartland of
trademark law, and does not receive special First Amendment
protection. The dilution issue is more simply addressed. The use of
a mark does not count as noncommercial just because it parodies, or
otherwise comments on, another’s products.

															I

															A

															Start at square 1, with what a trademark is
and does. The Lanham Act, the core federal trademark statute,
defines a trademark as follows: “[A]ny word, name, symbol, or
device, or any combination thereof ” that a person uses
“to identify and distinguish his or her goods . . .
from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the
source of the goods.” §1127. The first part of that
definition, identifying the kind of things covered, is broad: It
encompasses words (think “Google”), graphic designs
(Nike’s swoosh), and so-called trade dress, the overall
appearance of a product and its packaging (a Hershey’s Kiss,
in its silver wrapper). See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.
Samara Brothers, Inc., 529 U.S.
205, 209–210 (2000). The second part of the definition
describes every trademark’s “primary” function:
“to identify the origin or ownership of the article to which
it is affixed.” Hanover Star Milling Co. v.
Metcalf, 240 U.S.
403, 412 (1916). Trademarks can of course do other things:
catch a consumer’s eye, appeal to his fancies, and convey
every manner of message. But whatever else it may do, a trademark
is not a trademark unless it identifies a product’s source
(this is a Nike) and distinguishes that source from others (not any
other sneaker brand). See generally 1 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and
Unfair Competition §3:1 (5th ed. 2023). In other words, a mark
tells the public who is responsible for a product.

															In serving that function, trademarks benefit
consumers and producers alike. A source-identifying mark enables
customers to select “the goods and services that they wish to
purchase, as well as those they want to avoid.” Matal
v. Tam, 582 U.S. 218, 224 (2017). The mark “quickly
and easily assures a potential customer that this
item—the item with this mark—is made by the same
producer as other similarly marked items that he or she liked (or
disliked) in the past.” Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson
Products Co., 514 U.S.
159, 164 (1995). And because that is so, the producer of a
quality product may derive significant value from its marks. They
ensure that the producer itself—and not some “imitating
competitor”—will reap the financial rewards associated
with the product’s good reputation. Ibid.

															To help protect marks, the Lanham Act sets up a
voluntary registration system. Any mark owner may apply to the
Patent and Trademark Office to get its mark placed on a federal
register. Consistent with trademark law’s basic purpose, the
lead criterion for registration is that the mark “in fact
serve as a ‘trademark’ to identify and distinguish
goods.” 3 McCarthy §19:10 (listing the principal
register’s eligibility standards). If it does, and the
statute’s other criteria also are met, the registering
trademark owner receives certain benefits, useful in infringement
litigation. See, e.g., Iancu v. Brunetti, 588
U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 2) (noting that
“registration constitutes ‘prima facie evidence’
of the mark’s validity”). But the owner of even an
unregistered trademark can “use [the mark] in commerce and
enforce it against infringers.” Ibid.

															The Lanham Act also creates a federal cause of
action for trademark infringement. In the typical case, the owner
of a mark sues someone using a mark that closely resembles its own.
The court must decide whether the defendant’s use is
“likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to
deceive.” §§1114(1)(A), 1125(a)(1)(A). The
“keystone” in that statutory standard is
“likelihood of confusion.” See 4 McCarthy §23:1.
And the single type of confusion most commonly in trademark
law’s sights is confusion “about the source of a
product or service.” Moseley v. V Secret Catalogue,
Inc., 537 U.S.
418, 428 (2003); see 4 McCarthy §23:5. Confusion as to
source is the bête noire of trademark law—the thing
that stands directly opposed to the law’s twin goals of
facilitating consumers’ choice and protecting
producers’ good will.

															Finally, the Lanham Act creates a cause of
action for the dilution of famous marks, which can succeed without
likelihood of confusion. See §1125(c); Moseley, 537
U. S., at 431. A famous mark is one “widely
recognized” by the public as “designati[ng the]
source” of the mark owner’s goods. §1125(c)(2)(A).
Dilution of such a mark can occur “by tarnishment” (as
well as by “blurring,” not relevant here).
§1125(c)(1). As the statute describes the idea, an
“association arising from the similarity between” two
marks—one of them famous—may “harm[ ] the
reputation of the famous mark,” and thus make the other
mark’s owner liable. §1125(c)(2)(C). But there are
“[e]xclusions”—categories of activity not
“actionable as dilution.” §1125(c)(3). One
exclusion protects any “noncommercial use of a mark.”
§1125(c)(3)(C). Another protects a “fair use” of a
mark “in connection with . . . parodying,
criticizing, or commenting upon the famous mark owner or [its]
goods.” §1125(c)(3)(A)(ii). The fair-use exclusion,
though, comes with a caveat. A defendant cannot get its
benefit—even if engaging in parody, criticism, or
commentary—when using the similar-looking mark “as a
designation of source for the [defendant’s] own goods.”
§1125(c)(3)(A). In other words, the exclusion does not apply
if the defendant uses the similar mark as a mark.

															B

															A bottle of Jack Daniel’s—no, Jack
Daniel’s Old No. 7 Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey—boasts a
fair number of trademarks. Recall what the bottle looks like (or
better yet, retrieve a bottle from wherever you keep liquor;
it’s probably there):

															

															“Jack Daniel’s” is a
registered trademark, as is “Old No. 7.” So too the
arched Jack Daniel’s logo. And the stylized label with
filigree (i.e., twirling white lines). Finally, what might
be thought of as the platform for all those marks—the
whiskey’s distinctive square bottle—is itself
registered.

															VIP is a dog toy company, making and selling a
product line of chewable rubber toys that it calls “Silly
Squeakers.” (Yes, they squeak when bitten.) Most of the toys
in the line are designed to look like—and to
parody—popular beverage brands. There are, to take a
sampling, Dos Perros (cf. Dos Equis), Smella Arpaw (cf. Stella
Artois), and Doggie Walker (cf. Johnnie Walker). VIP has registered
trademarks in all those names, as in the umbrella term “Silly
Squeakers.”

															In 2014, VIP added the Bad Spaniels toy to the
line. VIP did not apply to register the name, or any other feature
of, Bad Spaniels. But according to its complaint (further addressed
below), VIP both “own[s]” and “use[s]” the
“ ‘Bad Spaniels’ trademark and trade
dress.” App. 3, 11; see infra, at 8, 17. And Bad
Spaniels’ trade dress, like the dress of many Silly Squeakers
toys, is designed to evoke a distinctive beverage
bottle-with-label. Even if you didn’t already know,
you’d probably not have much trouble identifying which
one.

															

															Bad Spaniels is about the same size and shape
as an ordinary bottle of Jack Daniel’s. The faux bottle, like
the original, has a black label with stylized white text and a
white filigreed border. The words “Bad Spaniels”
replace “Jack Daniel’s” in a like font and arch.
Above the arch is an image of a spaniel. (This is a dog toy, after
all.) Below the arch, “The Old No. 2 On Your Tennessee
Carpet” replaces “Old No. 7 Tennessee Sour Mash
Whiskey” in similar graphic form. The small print at the
bottom substitutes “43% poo by vol.” and “100%
smelly” for “40% alc. by vol. (80
proof ).”

															The toy is packaged for sale with a cardboard
hangtag (so it can be hung on store shelves). Here is the back of
the hangtag:

															

															At the bottom is a disclaimer: “This
product is not affiliated with Jack Daniel Distillery.” In
the middle are some warnings and guarantees. And at the top, most
relevant here, are two product logos—on the left for the
Silly Squeakers line, and on the right for the Bad Spaniels
toy.

															Soon after Bad Spaniels hit the market, Jack
Daniel’s sent VIP a letter demanding that it stop selling the
product. VIP responded by bringing this suit, seeking a declaratory
judgment that Bad Spaniels neither infringed nor diluted Jack
Daniel’s trademarks. The complaint alleged, among other
things, that VIP is “the owner of all rights in its
‘Bad Spaniels’ trademark and trade dress for its
durable rubber squeaky novelty dog toy.” App. 3; see
supra, at 6. Jack Daniel’s counterclaimed under the
Lanham Act for both trademark infringement and trademark dilution
by tarnishment.

															VIP moved for summary judgment on both claims.
First, VIP argued that Jack Daniel’s infringement claim
failed under a threshold test derived from the First Amendment to
protect “expressive works”—like (VIP said) the
Bad Spaniels toy. When those works are involved, VIP contended, the
so-called Rogers test requires dismissal of an infringement
claim at the outset unless the complainant can show one of two
things: that the challenged use of a mark “has no artistic
relevance to the underlying work” or that it
“explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the
work.” Rogers v. Grimaldi, 875 F.2d 994, 999
(CA2 1989) (Newman, J.). Because Jack Daniel’s could make
neither showing, VIP argued, the likelihood-of-confusion issue
became irrelevant. Second, VIP urged that Jack Daniel’s could
not succeed on a dilution claim because Bad Spaniels was a
“parody[ ]” of Jack Daniel’s, and therefore
made “fair use” of its famous marks.
§1125(c)(3)(A)(ii).

															The District Court rejected both contentions for
a common reason: because VIP had used the cribbed Jack
Daniel’s features as trademarks—that is, to identify
the source of its own products. In the court’s view, when
“another’s trademark is used for source
identification”—as the court thought was true
here—the threshold Rogers test does not apply. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 89a. Instead, the suit must address the
“standard” infringement question: whether the use is
“likely to cause consumer confusion.” Ibid. And
likewise, VIP could not invoke the dilution provision’s
fair-use exclusion. Parodies fall within that exclusion, the court
explained, only when the uses they make of famous marks do not
serve as “a designation of source for the [alleged
diluter’s] own goods.” Id., at 104a (quoting
§1125(c)(3)(A)).

															The case thus proceeded to a bench trial, where
Jack Daniel’s prevailed. The District Court found, based
largely on survey evidence, that consumers were likely to be
confused about the source of the Bad Spaniels toy. See 291
F. Supp. 3d 891, 906–911 (D Ariz. 2018). And the court
thought that the toy, by creating “negative
associations” with “canine excrement,” would
cause Jack Daniel’s “reputational harm.”
Id., at 903, 905.

															But the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
reversed, ruling that the District Court had gotten the pretrial
legal issues wrong. In the Ninth Circuit’s view, the
infringement claim was subject to the threshold Rogers test
because Bad Spaniels is an “expressive work”: Although
just a dog toy, and “surely not the equivalent of the Mona
Lisa,” it “communicates a humorous message.”
953 F.3d 1170, 1175 (2020) (internal quotation marks omitted). The
Court of Appeals therefore returned the case to the District Court
to decide whether Jack Daniel’s could satisfy either of
Rogers’ two prongs. And the Ninth Circuit awarded
judgment on the dilution claim to VIP. The court did not address
the statutory exclusion for parody and other fair use, as the
District Court had. Instead, the Court of Appeals held that the
exclusion for “noncommercial use” shielded VIP from
liability. §1125(c)(3)(C). The “use of a mark may be
‘noncommercial,’ ” the court reasoned,
“even if used to sell a product.” 953 F. 3d, at
1176 (internal quotation marks omitted). And here it was so, the
court found, because it “parodies” and “comments
humorously” on Jack Daniel’s. Id., at 1175; see
id., at 1176.

															On remand, the District Court found that Jack
Daniel’s could not satisfy either prong of Rogers, and
so granted summary judgment to VIP on infringement. Jack
Daniel’s appealed, and the Ninth Circuit summarily
affirmed.

															We then granted certiorari to consider the Court
of Appeals’ rulings on both infringement and dilution. 598
U. S. ___ (2022).

															II

															Our first and more substantial question
concerns Jack Daniel’s infringement claim: Should the company
have had to satisfy the Rogers threshold test before the
case could proceed to the Lanham Act’s
likelihood-of-confusion inquiry?[1] The parties address that issue in the broadest possible
way, either attacking or defending Rogers in all its
possible applications. Today, we choose a narrower path. Without
deciding whether Rogers has merit in other contexts, we hold
that it does not when an alleged infringer uses a trademark in the
way the Lanham Act most cares about: as a designation of source for
the infringer’s own goods. See §1127; supra, at
2–3. VIP used the marks derived from Jack Daniel’s in
that way, so the infringement claim here rises or falls on
likelihood of confusion. But that inquiry is not blind to the
expressive aspect of the Bad Spaniels toy that the Ninth Circuit
highlighted. Beyond source designation, VIP uses the marks at issue
in an effort to “parody” or “make fun” of
Jack Daniel’s. Tr. of Oral Arg. 58, 66. And that kind of
message matters in assessing confusion because consumers are not so
likely to think that the maker of a mocked product is itself doing
the mocking.

															A

															To see why the Rogers test does not
apply here, first consider the case from which it emerged. The
defendants there had produced and distributed a film by Federico
Fellini titled “Ginger and Fred” about two fictional
Italian cabaret dancers (Pippo and Amelia) who imitated Ginger
Rogers and Fred Astaire. When the film was released in the United
States, Ginger Rogers objected under the Lanham Act to the use of
her name. The Second Circuit rejected the claim. It reasoned that
the titles of “artistic works,” like the works
themselves, have an “expressive element” implicating
“ First Amendment values.” 875 F. 2d, at 998. And
at the same time, such names posed only a “slight risk”
of confusing consumers about either “the source or the
content of the work.” Id., at 999–1000. So, the
court concluded, a threshold filter was appropriate. When a title
“with at least some artistic relevance” was not
“explicitly misleading as to source or content,” the
claim could not go forward. Ibid. But the court made clear
that it was not announcing a general rule. In the typical case, the
court thought, the name of a product was more likely to indicate
its source, and to be taken by consumers in just that way. See
id., at 1000.

															Over the decades, the lower courts adopting
Rogers have confined it to similar cases, in which a
trademark is used not to designate a work’s source, but
solely to perform some other expressive function. So, for example,
when the toymaker Mattel sued a band over the song “Barbie
Girl”—with lyrics including “Life in plastic,
it’s fantastic” and “I’m a blond bimbo
girl, in a fantasy world”—the Ninth Circuit applied
Rogers. Mattel, Inc. v. MCA Records, Inc.,

296 F.3d 894, 901 (2002). That was because, the court reasoned,
the band’s use of the Barbie name was “not [as] a
source identifier”: The use did not “speak[ ] to
[the song’s] origin.” Id., at 900, 902; see
id., at 902 (a consumer would no more think that the song
was “produced by Mattel” than would, “upon
hearing Janis Joplin croon ‘Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a
Mercedes Benz?,’ . . . suspect that she and the
carmaker had entered into a joint venture”). Similarly, the
Eleventh Circuit dismissed a suit under Rogers when a sports
artist depicted the Crimson Tide’s trademarked football
uniforms solely to “memorialize” a notable event in
“football history.” University of Ala. Bd. of
Trustees v. New Life Art, Inc., 683 F.3d 1266, 1279
(2012). And when Louis Vuitton sued because a character in the film
The Hangover: Part II described his luggage as a “Louis
Vuitton” (though pronouncing it Lewis), a district
court dismissed the complaint under Rogers. See Louis
Vuitton Mallatier S. A. v. Warner Bros. Entertainment
Inc., 868 F. Supp. 2d 172 (SDNY 2012). All parties agreed that
the film was not using the Louis Vuitton mark as its “own
identifying trademark.” Id., at 180 (internal
quotation marks omitted). When that is so, the court reasoned,
“confusion will usually be unlikely,” and the
“interest in free expression” counsels in favor of
avoiding the standard Lanham Act test. Ibid.

															The same courts, though, routinely conduct
likelihood-of-confusion analysis, without mentioning Rogers,
when trademarks are used as trademarks—i.e., to
designate source. See, e.g., JL Beverage Co., LLC v.
Jim Beam Brands Co., 828 F.3d 1098, 1102–1103, 1106
(CA9 2016); PlayNation Play Systems, Inc. v. Velex
Corp., 924 F.3d 1159, 1164–1165 (CA11 2019). And the
Second Circuit—Rogers’ home court—has made
especially clear that Rogers does not apply in that context.
For example, that court held that an offshoot political
group’s use of the trademark “United We Stand
America” got no Rogers help because the use was as a
source identifier. See United We Stand Am., Inc. v.
United We Stand, Am. New York, Inc., 
128 F.3d 86, 93 (1997). True, that slogan had expressive
content. But the defendant group, the court reasoned, was using it
“as a mark,” to suggest the “same source
identification” as the original “political
movement.” Ibid. And similarly, the Second Circuit
(indeed, the judge who authored Rogers) rejected a
motorcycle mechanic’s view that his modified version of
Harley Davidson’s bar-and-shield logo was an expressive
parody entitled to Rogers’ protection. See
Harley-Davidson, Inc. v. Grottanelli, 
164 F.3d 806, 812–813 (1999). The court acknowledged that
the mechanic’s adapted logo conveyed a “somewhat
humorous[ ]” message. Id., at 813. But his use of
the logo was a quintessential “trademark use”: to brand
his “repair and parts business”—through signage,
a newsletter, and T-shirts—with images “similar”
to Harley-Davidson’s. Id., at 809, 812–813.

															The point is that whatever you make of
Rogers—and again, we take no position on that
issue—it has always been a cabined doctrine. If we put this
case to the side, the Rogers test has applied only to cases
involving “non-trademark uses”—or otherwise said,
cases in which “the defendant has used the mark” at
issue in a “non-source-identifying way.” S. Dogan &
M. Lemley, Grounding Trademark Law Through Trademark Use, 92 Iowa
L. Rev. 1669, 1684 (2007); see id., at 1683–1684,
and n. 58. The test has not insulated from ordinary trademark
scrutiny the use of trademarks as trademarks, “to identify or
brand [a defendant’s] goods or services.” Id.,
at 1683.

															We offer as one last example of that limitation
a case with a striking resemblance to this one. It too involved dog
products, though perfumes rather than toys. Yes, the defendant sold
“a line of pet perfumes whose names parody elegant brands
sold for human consumption.” Tommy Hilfiger Licensing,
Inc. v. Nature Labs, LLC, 
221 F. Supp. 2d 410, 412 (SDNY 2002) (Mukasey, J.). The product
at issue was named Timmy Holedigger—which Tommy Hilfiger
didn’t much like. The defendant asked for application of
Rogers. The court declined it, relying on
Harley-Davidson. See 221 F. Supp. 2d, at 414.
Rogers, the court explained, kicks in when a suit involves
solely “nontrademark uses of [a] mark—that is, where
the trademark is not being used to indicate the source or
origin” of a product, but only to convey a different kind of
message. 221 F. Supp. 2d, at 414. When, instead, the use is
“at least in part” for “source
identification”—when the defendant may be
“trading on the good will of the trademark owner to market
its own goods”—Rogers has no proper role. 221
F. Supp. 2d, at 414–415. And that is so, the court
continued, even if the defendant is also “making an
expressive comment,” including a parody of a different
product. Id., at 415. The defendant is still “mak[ing]
trademark use of another’s mark,” and must meet an
infringement claim on the usual battleground of “likelihood
of confusion.” Id., at 416.

															That conclusion fits trademark law, and reflects
its primary mission. From its definition of “trademark”
onward, the Lanham Act views marks as source identifiers—as
things that function to “indicate the source” of goods,
and so to “distinguish” them from ones
“manufactured or sold by others.” §1127; see
supra, at 2–3. The cardinal sin under the law, as
described earlier, is to undermine that function. See supra,
at 3. It is to confuse consumers about source—to make (some
of ) them think that one producer’s products are
another’s. And that kind of confusion is most likely to arise
when someone uses another’s trademark as a
trademark—meaning, again, as a source identifier—rather
than for some other expressive function. To adapt one of the cases
noted above: Suppose a filmmaker uses a Louis Vuitton suitcase to
convey something about a character (he is the kind of person who
wants to be seen with the product but doesn’t know how to
pronounce its name). See supra, at 12. Now think about a
different scenario: A luggage manufacturer uses an ever-so-slightly
modified LV logo to make inroads in the suitcase market. The
greater likelihood of confusion inheres in the latter use, because
it is the one conveying information (or misinformation) about who
is responsible for a product. That kind of use “implicate[s]
the core concerns of trademark law” and creates “the
paradigmatic infringement case.” G. Dinwoodie & M. Janis,
Confusion Over Use: Contextualism in Trademark Law, 92 Iowa
L. Rev. 1597, 1636 (2007). So the Rogers
test—which offers an escape from the likelihood-of-confusion
inquiry and a shortcut to dismissal—has no proper
application.[2]

															Nor does that result change because the use of a
mark has other expressive content—i.e., because it
conveys some message on top of source. Here is where we most
dramatically part ways with the Ninth Circuit, which thought that
because Bad Spaniels “communicates a humorous message,”
it is automatically entitled to Rogers’ protection.
953 F. 3d, at 1175 (internal quotation marks omitted). On that
view, Rogers might take over much of the world. For
trademarks are often expressive, in any number of ways. Consider
how one liqueur brand’s trade dress (beyond identifying
source) tells a story, with a bottle in the shape of a
friar’s habit connoting the product’s olden monastic
roots:

															

															Or take a band name that “not only
identifies the band but expresses a view about social
issues.” Tam, 582 U. S., at 245 (opinion of
Alito, J.) (discussing “The Slants”). Or note how a
mark can both function as a mark and have parodic content—as
the court found in the Hilfiger/Holedigger litigation. See
supra, at 13–14. The examples could go on and on. As a
leading treatise puts the point, the Ninth Circuit’s
expansion of Rogers “potentially encompasses just
about everything” because names, phrases, symbols, designs,
and their varied combinations often “contain some
‘expressive’ message” unrelated to source. 6
McCarthy §31:144.50. That message may well be relevant in
assessing the likelihood of confusion between two marks, as we
address below. See infra, at 18–19. But few cases
would even get to the likelihood-of-confusion inquiry if all
expressive content triggered the Rogers filter. In that
event, the Rogers exception would become the general rule,
in conflict with courts’ longstanding view of trademark
law.

															The Ninth Circuit was mistaken to believe that
the First Amendment demanded such a result. The court
thought that trademark law would otherwise “fail[ ] to
account for the full weight of the public’s interest in free
expression.” 953 F. 3d, at 1174. But as the
Mattel (i.e., Barbie) court noted, when a challenged
trademark use functions as “source-identifying,”
trademark rights “play well with the First Amendment”:
“Whatever first amendment rights you may have in calling the
brew you make in your bathtub ‘Pepsi’ ” are
“outweighed by the buyer’s interest in not being fooled
into buying it.” 296 F. 3d, at 900. Or in less colorful
terms: “[T]o the extent a trademark is confusing” as to
a product’s source “the law can protect consumers and
trademark owners.” Tam, 582 U. S., at 252
(Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see
Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U.S.
1, 15 (1979) (rejecting a First Amendment challenge to a law
restricting trade names because of the “substantial”
interest in “protecting the public from [their] deceptive and
misleading use”). Or yet again, in an especially clear
rendering: “[T]he trademark law generally prevails over the
First Amendment” when “another’s trademark (or a
confusingly similar mark) is used without permission” as a
means of “source identification.” Yankee Publishing
Inc. v. News Am. Publishing Inc., 
809 F. Supp. 267, 276 (SDNY 1992) (Leval, J.) (emphasis
deleted). So for those uses, the First Amendment does not demand a
threshold inquiry like the Rogers test. When a mark is used
as a mark (except, potentially, in rare situations), the
likelihood-of-confusion inquiry does enough work to account for the
interest in free expression.

															B

															Here, the District Court correctly held that
“VIP uses its Bad Spaniels trademark and trade dress as
source identifiers of its dog toy.” See App. to Pet. for
Cert. 105a. In fact, VIP conceded that point below. In its
complaint, VIP alleged that it both “own[s] and
“use[s]” the “ ‘Bad Spaniels’
trademark and trade dress for its durable rubber squeaky novelty
dog toy.” App. 3, 11. The company thus represented in this
very suit that the mark and dress, although not registered, are
used to “identify and distinguish [VIP’s] goods”
and to “indicate [their] source.” §1127.
(Registration of marks, you’ll recall, is optional. See
supra, at 3–4.)

															In this Court, VIP says the complaint was a mere
“form allegation”—a matter of “rote.”
Tr. of Oral Arg. 73. But even if we knew what that meant, VIP has
said and done more in the same direction. First, there is the way
the product is marketed. On the hangtag, the Bad Spaniels logo sits
opposite the concededly trademarked Silly Squeakers logo, with both
appearing to serve the same source-identifying function. See
supra, at 7. And second, there is VIP’s practice as to
other products in the Silly Squeakers line. The company has
consistently argued in court that it owns, though has never
registered, the trademark and trade dress in dog toys like
“Jose Perro” (cf. Jose Cuervo) and
“HeinieSniff ’n” (cf. Heineken).[3] And it has chosen to register the
names of still other dog toys, including Dos Perros (#6176781),
Smella Arpaw (#6262975), and Doggie Walker (#6213816). See
supra, at 6. Put all that together, and more than
“form” or “rote” emerges: VIP’s
conduct is its own admission that it is using the Bad Spaniels
(née Jack Daniel’s) trademarks as trademarks, to
identify product source.

															Because that is so, the only question in this
suit going forward is whether the Bad Spaniels marks are likely to
cause confusion. There is no threshold test working to kick out all
cases involving “expressive works.” But a
trademark’s expressive message—particularly a parodic
one, as VIP asserts—may properly figure in assessing the
likelihood of confusion. See, e.g., Louis Vuitton
Malletier S. A. v. Haute Diggity Dog, LLC, 507 F.3d 252,
265 (CA4 2007) (Parody “influences the way in which the
[likelihood-of-confusion] factors are applied”); Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 17–22 (same). A parody
must “conjure up” “enough of [an] original to
make the object of its critical wit recognizable.”
Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S.
569, 588 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet to
succeed, the parody must also create contrasts, so that its message
of ridicule or pointed humor comes clear. And once that is done
(if that is done), a parody is not often likely to create
confusion. Self-deprecation is one thing; self-mockery far less
ordinary. So although VIP’s effort to ridicule Jack
Daniel’s does not justify use of the Rogers test, it
may make a difference in the standard trademark analysis.
Consistent with our ordinary practice, we remand that issue to the
courts below. See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S.
709, 718, n. 7 (2005) (noting that this Court is generally
“a court of review, not of first view”).

															III

															Our second question, more easily dispatched,
concerns Jack Daniel’s claim of dilution by tarnishment (for
the linkage of its whiskey to less savory substances). Recall that
the Ninth Circuit dismissed that claim based on one of the Lanham
Act’s “[e]xclusions” from dilution
liability—for “[a]ny noncommercial use of a
mark.” §1125(c)(3)(C); see supra, at 9. On the
court’s view, the “use of a mark may be
‘noncommercial’ even if used to sell a product.”
953 F. 3d, at 1176 (internal quotation marks omitted). And
VIP’s use is so, the court continued, because it
“parodies” and “convey[s] a humorous
message” about Jack Daniel’s. Id., at
1175–1176. We need not express a view on the first step of
that reasoning because we think the second step wrong. However wide
the scope of the “noncommercial use” exclusion, it
cannot include, as the Ninth Circuit thought, every parody or
humorous commentary.

															To begin to see why, consider the scope of
another of the Lanham Act’s exclusions—this one for
“[a]ny fair use.” As described earlier, the “fair
use” exclusion specifically covers uses “parodying,
criticizing, or commenting upon” a famous mark owner.
§1125(c)(3)(A)(ii); see supra, at 5. But not in every
circumstance. Critically, the fair-use exclusion has its own
exclusion: It does not apply when the use is “as a
designation of source for the person’s own goods or
services.” §1125(c)(3)(A). In that event, no parody,
criticism, or commentary will rescue the alleged dilutor. It will
be subject to liability regardless.

															The problem with the Ninth Circuit’s
approach is that it reverses that statutorily directed result, as
this case illustrates. Given the fair-use provision’s
carve-out, parody (and criticism and commentary, humorous or
otherwise) is exempt from liability only if not used to
designate source. Whereas on the Ninth Circuit’s view, parody
(and so forth) is exempt always—regardless whether it
designates source. The expansive view of the “noncommercial
use” exclusion effectively nullifies Congress’s express
limit on the fair-use exclusion for parody, etc. Just consider how
the Ninth Circuit’s construction played out here. The
District Court had rightly concluded that because VIP used the
challenged marks as source identifiers, it could not benefit from
the fair-use exclusion for parody. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 105a;
supra, at 8–9, 17–18. The Ninth Circuit took no
issue with that ruling. But it shielded VIP’s parodic uses
anyway. In doing so, the court negated Congress’s judgment
about when—and when not—parody (and criticism and
commentary) is excluded from dilution liability.

															IV

															Today’s opinion is narrow. We do not
decide whether the Rogers test is ever appropriate, or how
far the “noncommercial use” exclusion goes. On
infringement, we hold only that Rogers does not apply when
the challenged use of a mark is as a mark. On dilution, we hold
only that the noncommercial exclusion does not shield parody or
other commentary when its use of a mark is similarly
source-identifying. It is no coincidence that both our holdings
turn on whether the use of a mark is serving a source-designation
function. The Lanham Act makes that fact crucial, in its effort to
ensure that consumers can tell where goods come from.

															For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment
below and remand for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 To be clear, when we
refer to “the Rogers threshold test,” we mean
any threshold First Amendment filter.
2
 That is not to say (far
from it) that every infringement case involving a
source-identifying use requires full-scale litigation. Some of
those uses will not present any plausible likelihood of
confusion—because of dissimilarity in the marks or various
contextual considerations. And if, in a given case, a plaintiff
fails to plausibly allege a likelihood of confusion, the district
court should dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 12(b)(6). See 6 McCarthy §32:121.75 (providing
examples).
