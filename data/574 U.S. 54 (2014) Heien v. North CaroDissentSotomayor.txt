															NICHOLAS BRADY HEIEN, PETITIONER v. NORTH CAROLINA

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of north carolina

															[December 15, 2014]

															Justice Sotomayor, dissenting.

															The Court is, of course, correct that
â€œÂ â€˜the ultimate
touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is
â€œreasonableness.â€Â â€™Â â€
Riley v. California, 573 U.Â S. ___, ___
(2014) (slip op., at 5). But this broad statement simply sets the
standard a court is to apply when it conducts its inquiry into
whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated. It does not define
the categories of inputs that courts are to consider when assessing
the reasonableness of a search or seizure, each of which must be
independently justified. What this case requires us to decide is
whether a police officerâ€™s understanding of the
law is an input into the reasonableness inquiry, or whether this
inquiry instead takes the law as a given and assesses an
officerâ€™s understanding of the facts against a
fixed legal yardstick.

															I would hold that determining whether a search or seizure is
reasonable requires evaluating an officerâ€™s
understanding of the facts against the actual state of the law. I
would accordingly reverse the judgment of the North Carolina
Supreme Court, and I respectfully dissent from the
Courtâ€™s contrary holding.

															I

															It is common ground that Heien was seized within the meaning of
the Fourth Amendment. Such a seizure comports with the Constitution
only if the officers had articulable and reasonable suspicion that
Heien was breaking the law. In Ornelas v. United
States,517 U.Â S. 690,696 (1996), we explained that
the â€œprincipal componentsâ€ of that
determination â€œwill be the events which occurred
leading up to the stop or search, and then the decision whether
these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an
objectively reasonable police officer, amount to reasonable
suspicion or to probable cause.â€ We described this kind
of determination as â€œa mixed question of law and
factâ€:
â€œÂ â€˜[T]he issue is
whether the facts satisfy the [relevant] statutory [or
constitutional] standard, or to put it another way, whether the
rule of law as applied to the established facts is or is not
violated.â€™Â â€ Id.,
at 696â€“697 (quoting Pullman-Standard v.
Swint, 456 U.Â S 273, 289, n.Â 19
(1982)). What matters, we said, are the facts as viewed by an
objectively reasonable officer, and the rule of
lawâ€”not an officerâ€™s
conception of the rule of law, and not even an
officerâ€™s reasonable misunderstanding about the
law, but the law.

															As a result, when we have talked about the leeway that officers
have in making probable-cause determinations, we have focused on
their assessments of facts. See, e.g., Terry v.
Ohio,392 U. S. 1â€“22 (1968) (framing the
question as whether the â€œfactsâ€ give
rise to reasonable suspicion). We have conceded that an arresting
officerâ€™s state of mind does not factor into the
probable-cause inquiry, â€œexcept for the
facts that he knows.â€ Devenpeck v.
Alford,543 U.Â S. 146,153 (2004) (emphasis
added). And we have said that, to satisfy the reasonableness
requirement, â€œwhat is generally demanded of the
many factual determinations that must regularly be made by
agents of the government .Â .Â . is not that
they always be correct, but that they always be
reasonable.â€ Illinois v. Rodriguez,497
U.Â S. 177,185 (1990) (emphasis added). There is
scarcely a peep in these cases to suggest that an
officerâ€™s understanding or conception of
anything other than the facts is relevant.

															This framing of the reasonableness inquiry has not only been
focused on officersâ€™ understanding of the facts,
it has been justified in large part based on the recognition that
officers are generally in a superior position, relative to courts,
to evaluate those facts and their significance as they unfold. In
other words, the leeway we afford officersâ€™
factual assessments is rooted not only in our recognition that
police officers operating in the field have to make quick
decisions, see id., at 186, but also in our understanding
that police officers have the expertise to
â€œdra[w] inferences and mak[e] deductions
.Â .Â . that might well elude an untrained
person.â€ United States v. Cortez,449
U.Â S. 411,418 (1981). When officers evaluate unfolding
circumstances, they deploy that expertise to draw
â€œconclusions about human behaviorâ€
much in the way that â€œjurors [do] as
factfinders.â€ Ibid. (emphasis added).

															The same cannot be said about legal exegesis. After all, the
meaning of the law is not probabilistic in the same way that
factual determinations are. Rather, â€œthe notion
that the law is definite and knowableâ€ sits at the
foundation of our legal system. Cheek v. United
States,498 U.Â S. 192,199 (1991). And it is courts,
not officers, that are in the best position to interpret the
laws.

															Both our enunciation of the reasonableness inquiry and our
justification for it thus have always turned on an
officerâ€™s factual conclusions and an
officerâ€™s expertise with respect to those
factual conclusions. Neither has hinted at taking into account an
officerâ€™s understanding of the law, reasonable
or otherwise.

															II

															Departing from this tradition means further eroding the Fourth
Amendmentâ€™s protection of civil liberties in a
context where that protection has already been worn down. Traffic
stops like those at issue here can be â€œannoying,
frightening, and perhaps humiliating.â€ Terry,
392 U.Â S., at 25; see Delaware v.
Prouse,440 U.Â S. 648,657 (1979). We have
nevertheless held that an officerâ€™s subjective
motivations do not render a traffic stop unlawful. Whren v.
United States,517 U.Â S. 806 (1996). But we
assumed in Whren that when an officer acts on pretext, at
least that pretext would be the violation of an actual law. See
id., at 810 (discussing the three provisions of the District
of Columbia traffic code that the parties accepted the officer had
probable cause to believe had been vio-lated). Giving officers
license to effect seizures so long as they can attach to their
reasonable view of the facts some reasonable legal interpretation
(or misinterpretation) that suggests a law has been violated
significantly expands this authority. Cf. Barlow v.
United States, 7 Pet. 404, 411 (1833) (Story, J.)
(â€œThere is scarcely any law which does not admit
of some ingenious doubtâ€). One wonders how a citizen
seeking to be law-abiding and to structure his or her behavior to
avoid these invasive, frightening, and humiliating encounters could
do so.

															In addition to these human
consequencesâ€”including those for communities and
for their relationships with the
policeâ€”permitting mistakes of law to justify
seizures has the perverse effect of preventing or delaying the
clarification of the law. Under such an approach, courts need not
interpret statutory language but can instead simply decide whether
an officerâ€™s interpretation was reasonable.
Indeed, had this very case arisen after the North Carolina Supreme
Court announced its rule, the North Carolina Court of Appeals would
not have had the occasion to interpret the statute at issue.
Similarly, courts in the Eighth Circuit, which has been the only
Circuit to include police mistakes of law in the reasonableness
inquiry, have observed that they need not decide interpretive
questions under their approach. See, e.g., United
States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, 444 F. 3d 1020,
1022â€“1023 (CA8 2006).[1] This
result is bad for citizens, who need to know their rights and
responsibilities, and it is bad for police, who would benefit from
clearer direction. Cf. Camreta v. Greene, 563
U.Â S. ___, ___â€“___ (2011) (slip op.,
at 10â€“11) (recognizing the importance of
clarifying the law).

															Of course, if the law enforcement system could not function
without permitting mistakes of law to justify seizures, one could
at least argue that permitting as much is a necessary evil. But I
have not seen any persuasive argument that law enforcement will be
unduly hampered by a rule that precludes consideration of mistakes
of law in the reasonableness inquiry. After all, there is no
indication that excluding an officerâ€™s mistake
of law from the reasonableness inquiry has created a problem for
law enforcement in the overwhelming number of Circuits which have
adopted that approach. If an officer makes a stop in good faith but
it turns out that, as in this case, the officer was wrong about
what the law proscribed or required, I know of no penalty that the
officer would suffer. See 366 N.Â C. 271,
286â€“288, 737 S.Â E. 2d 351,
361â€“362 (2012) (Hudson, J., dissenting)
(observing that â€œofficers (rightfully) face no
punishment for a stop based on a mistake of lawâ€).
Moreover, such an officer would likely have a defense to any civil
suit on the basis of qualified immunity. See Ashcroft v.
al-Kidd, 563 U.Â S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at
12) (â€œQualified immunity gives government
officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments
about open legal questionsâ€).

															Nor will it often be the case that any evidence that may be
seized during the stop will be suppressed, thanks to the exception
to the exclusionary rule for good-faith police errors. See,
e.g., Davis v. United States, 564
U.Â S. ___, ___â€“___ (2011) (slip op.,
at 8â€“9). It is true that, unlike most States,
North Carolina does not provide a good-faith exception as a matter
of state law, see State v. Carter, 322
N.Â C. 709, 721â€“724, 370
S.Â E. 2d 553, 560â€“562 (1988), but
North Carolina recognizes that it may solve any remedial problems
it may perceive on its own, see id., at 724, 370
S.Â E. 2d, at 562; N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.
Â§15Aâ€“974 (2013) (statutory
good-faith exception).[2] More fundamentally,
that is a remedial concern, and the protections offered by the
Fourth Amendment are not meant to yield to accommodate remedial
concerns. Our jurisprudence draws a sharp
â€œanalytica[l] distinct[ion]â€ between
the existence of a Fourth Amendment violation and the remedy for
that violation. Davis, 564 U.Â S., at ___ (slip
op., at 14).

															In short, there is nothing in our case law requiring us to hold
that a reasonable mistake of law can justify a seizure under the
Fourth Amendment, and quite a bit suggesting just the opposite. I
also see nothing to be gained from such a holding, and much to be
lost.

															III

															In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Court makes both
serious legal and practical errors. On the legal side, the Court
barely addresses Ornelas and the other cases that frame the
reasonableness inquiry around factual determinations. Instead, in
support of its conclusion that reasonable suspicion
â€œarises from the combination of an
officerâ€™s understanding of the facts and
his understanding of the relevant law,â€ ante, at
6 (emphasis added), the Court first reaches to founding-era customs
statutes and cases applying those statutes. It concedes, however,
that these cases are â€œnot directly on
pointâ€ because they say nothing about the scope of the
Fourth Amendment and are instead equivalents of our modern-day
qualified immunity jurisprudence for civil damages. Ante, at
7.

															The only link in the tenuous chain the Court constructs between
those cases and this one that has anything to say about the Fourth
Amendment is Brinegar v. United States,338
U.Â S. 160 (1949). See ante, at 8. But all that
our opinion in Brinegar actually says is that probable cause
exists where
â€œÂ â€˜the facts and
circumstances within [the officersâ€™] knowledge
and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are]
sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in
the belief thatâ€™ an offense has been or is being
committed.â€ 338 U.Â S., at
175â€“176 (quoting Carroll v. United
States,267 U.Â S. 132,162 (1925)). It thus states
the uncontroversial proposition that the probable-cause inquiry
looks to the reasonableness of an officerâ€™s
understanding of the facts. Indeed, Brinegar is an odd case
for the Court to rely on given that, like the cases I discussed
above, it subsequently emphasizes that â€œthe
mistakes must be those of reasonable men, acting on facts
leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability.â€
338 U.Â S., at 176 (emphasis added). Again, reasonable
understandings of the facts, not reasonable understandings of what
the law says.[3]

															Further, the Court looks to our decision in Michigan v.
DeFillippo,443 U.Â S. 31 (1979). This is a Fourth
Amendment case, but the Courtâ€™s reading of it
imagines a holding that is not rooted in the logic of the opinion.
We held in DeFillippo that an officer had probable cause to
support an arrest even though the ordinance that had allegedly been
violated was later held by the Michigan Court of Appeals to be
unconstitutional. This was so, we explained, because the officer
conducted an arrest after having observed conduct that was
criminalized by a presumptively valid law at the time of that
conduct. See id., at 37 (â€œAt th[e] time
[of the arrest], of course, there was no controlling precedent that
this ordinance was or was not constitutional, and hence the conduct
observed violated a presumptively valid ordinanceâ€). We
noted that it would have been wrong for that officer not to enforce
the law in that sit-uation. See id., at 38
(â€œPolice are charged to enforce laws until and
unless they are declared
unconstitutional.Â .Â .Â . Society
would be ill-served if its police officers tookit upon themselves
to determine which laws are and which are not constitutionally
entitled to enforcementâ€).

															DeFillippo thus did not involve any police
â€œmistakeâ€ at all. Rather,
DeFillippo involved a police officer correctly applying the
law that was then in existence and that carried with it a
presumption of validity. Here, by contrast, police stopped Heien on
suspicion of committing an offense that never actually existed.
Given that our holding in DeFillippo relied so squarely on
the existence of a law criminalizing the
defendantâ€™s conduct, and on the presumption of
validity that attends actual laws, it can hardly be said to control
where, as here, no law ever actually criminalized
Heienâ€™s conduct.

															On the practical side, the Court primarily contends that an
officer may confront â€œa situation in the field
as to which the application of a statute is unclear.â€
Ante, at 11. One is left to wonder, however, why an innocent
citizen should be made to shoulder the burden of being seized
whenever the law may be susceptible to an interpretive question.
Moreover, the Court fails to reconcile its belief that the Fourth
Amendment gives officers leeway to address situations where the
application of a criminal statute may be unclear with our prior
assumption that the Fourth Amendment does not give officers such
leeway where they rely on a statute that authorizes police conduct
that may violate the Fourth Amendment. See Illinois v.
Krull,480 U.Â S. 340, n.Â 12, 359
(1987). Nor does it engage with the analytic consequences of North
Carolinaâ€™s similar concession that it does not
mean to claim â€œthat an
officerâ€™s mistaken understanding of the Fourth
Amendment itself can support a seizure if that understanding was
reason-able.â€ Brief for Respondent 29. It is not clear
why an officerâ€™s mistaken understanding of other
laws should be viewed differently.

															While I appreciate that the Court has endeavored to set some
bounds on the types of mistakes of law that it thinks will qualify
as reasonable, and while I think that the set of reasonable
mistakes of law ought to be narrowly circumscribed if they are to
be countenanced at all, I am not at all convinced that the Court
has done so in a clear way. It seems to me that the difference
between qualified immunityâ€™s reasonableness
standardâ€”which the Court insists without
elaboration does not apply hereâ€”and the
Courtâ€™s conception of reasonableness in this
contextâ€”which remains
undefinedâ€”will prove murky in application. See
ante, at 11. I fear the Courtâ€™s
unwillingness to sketch a fuller view of what makes a mistake of
law reasonable only presages the likely difficulty that courts will
have applying the Courtâ€™s decision in this
case.

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															To my mind, the more administrable
approachâ€”and the one more consistent with our
precedents and principlesâ€”would be to hold that
an officerâ€™s mistake of law, no matter how
reasonable, cannot support the individualized suspicion necessary
to justify a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. I respectfully
dissent.

Notes
1Â Every other Circuit to have
squarely addressed the question has held that police mistakes of
law are not a factor in the reasonableness inquiry. See United
States v. Miller, 146 F. 3d 274, 279 (CA5 1998);
United States v. McDonald, 453 F. 3d 958, 962 (CA7
2006); United States v. King, 244 F. 3d 736, 741 (CA9
2001); United States v. Nicholson, 721 F. 3d 1236,
1244 (CA10 2013); United States v. Chanthasouxat, 342
F. 3d 1271, 1279â€“1280 (CA11 2003). Five States
have agreed. See Hilton v. State, 961 So. 2d 284, 298
(Fla. 2007); State v. Louwrens, 792 N. W. 2d 649, 652
(Iowa 2010); Martin v. Kansas Dept. of Revenue, 285
Kan. 625, 637â€“639, 176 P. 3d 938, 948 (2008);
State v. Anderson, 683 N.Â W. 2d 818,
823â€“824 (Minn. 2004); State v.
Lacasella, 313 Mont. 185, 193â€“195, 60 P.
3d 975, 981â€“982 (2002).
2Â In addition to North Carolina,
it appears that 13 States do not provide a good-faith exception.
See State v. Marsala, 216 Conn. 150, 151, 579

Guzman, 122 Idaho 981, 998, 842 P.Â 2d 660, 677
(1992); State v. Cline, 617 N.Â W. 2d 277,

604, 606, 612 (1996) (limiting the exception to situations where
police have a warrant).
3Â The Court in fact errs even
earlier in the chain when it represents United States v.
Riddle, 5 Cranch 311 (1809), as containing some broad
proposition. Ante, at 6â€“7. As Justice
Story explained in a later case, the tolerance of mistakes of law
in cases like Riddle was a result of the specific customs
statute that Congress had enacted. The Apollon, 9 Wheat.
362, 373 (1824) (explaining that findings of probable cause
â€œha[d] never been supposed to excuse any
seizure, except where some statute creates and defines the
exemption from damagesâ€ (emphasis added)).
