															on writs of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 15, 2023]

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full. I
write separately to emphasize that the Court today does not address
or decide the equal protection issue that can arise when the Indian
Child Welfare Act is applied in individual foster care or adoption
proceedings. See ante, at 29, 32, n. 10. As the Court
explains, the plaintiffs in this federal-court suit against federal
parties lack standing to raise the equal protection issue. So the
equal protection issue remains undecided.

															In my view, the equal protection issue is
serious. Under the Act, a child in foster care or adoption
proceedings may in some cases be denied a particular placement
because of the child’s race—even if the placement is
otherwise determined to be in the child’s best interests. And
a prospective foster or adoptive parent may in some cases be denied
the opportunity to foster or adopt a child because of the
prospective parent’s race. Those scenarios raise significant
questions under bedrock equal protection principles and this
Court’s precedents. See Palmore v. Sidoti,
466 U.S.
429 (1984). Courts, including ultimately this Court, will be
able to address the equal protection issue when it is properly
raised by a plaintiff with standing—for example, by a
prospective foster or adoptive parent or child in a case arising
out of a state-court foster care or adoption proceeding. See
ante, at 29, 32, n. 10.
