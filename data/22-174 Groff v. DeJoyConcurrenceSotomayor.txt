															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–174

															_________________

															GERALD E. GROFF, PETITIONER v. LOUIS
DeJOY, POSTMASTER GENERAL

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the third circuit

															[June 29, 2023]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Jackson
joins, concurring.

															As both parties here agree, the phrase
“more than a de minimis cost” from Trans
World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 432 U.S.
63, 84 (1977), was loose language. An employer violates Title
VII if it fails “to reasonably accommodate” an
employee’s religious observance or practice, unless the
employer demonstrates that accommodation would result in
“undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s
business.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e(j). The
statutory standard is “undue hardship,” not trivial
cost.

															Hardison, however, cannot be reduced to
its “de minimis” language. Instead, that case
must be understood in light of its facts and the Court’s
reasoning. The Hardison Court concluded that the
plaintiff ’s proposed accommodation would have imposed
an undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business
because the accommodation would have required the employer either
to deprive other employees of their seniority rights under a
collective-bargaining agreement, or to incur substantial additional
costs in the form of lost efficiency or higher wages. 432
U. S., at 79–81, 83–84, and n. 14. The Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission has interpreted Title VII’s
undue-hardship standard in this way for seven consecutive
Presidential administrations, from President Reagan to President
Biden. See 29 CFR §1605.2(e) (2022) (citing Hardison,
432 U. S., at 80, 84).

															Petitioner Gerald Groff asks this Court to
overrule Hardison and to replace it with a
“significant difficulty or expense” standard. Brief for
Petitioner 17–38. The Court does not do so. That is a wise
choice because stare decisis has “enhanced
force” in statutory cases. Kimble v. Marvel
Entertainment, LLC, 576 U.S. 446, 456 (2015). Congress is free
to revise this Court’s statutory interpretations. The
Court’s respect for Congress’s decision not to
intervene promotes the separation of powers by requiring interested
parties to resort to the legislative rather than the judicial
process to achieve their policy goals. This justification for
statutory stare decisis is especially strong here because
“Congress has spurned multiple opportunities to reverse
[Hardison]—openings as frequent and clear as this
Court ever sees.” Id., at 456–457.[1] Moreover, in the decades since
Hardison was decided, Congress has revised Title VII
multiple times in response to other decisions of this
Court,[2] yet never in response
to Hardison. See Kimble, 576 U. S., at 457.

															Groff also asks the Court to decide that Title
VII requires the United States Postal Service to show “undue
hardship to [its] business,” not to
Groff ’s co-workers. Brief for Petitioner 42 (emphasis
added); see 35 F. 4th 162, 176 (CA3 2022) (Hardiman, J.,
dissenting). The Court, however, recognizes that Title VII requires
“undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s
business.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e(j) (emphasis
added). Because the “conduct of [a] business” plainly
includes the management and performance of the business’s
employees, undue hardship on the conduct of a business may include
undue hardship on the business’s employees. See, e.g.,
Hardison, 432 U. S., at 79–81 (deprivation of
employees’ bargained-for seniority rights constitutes undue
hardship). There is no basis in the text of the statute, let alone
in economics or common sense, to conclude otherwise. Indeed, for
many businesses, labor is more important to the conduct of the
business than any other factor.

															To be sure, some effects on co-workers will not
constitute “undue hardship” under Title VII. For
example, animus toward a protected group is not a cognizable
“hardship” under any antidiscrimination statute. Cf.
ante, at 20. In addition, some hardships, such as the labor
costs of coordinating voluntary shift swaps, are not
“undue” because they are too insubstantial. See 29 CFR
§§1605.2(d)(1)(i), (e)(1). Nevertheless, if there is an
undue hardship on “the conduct of the employer’s
business,” 42 U. S. C. §2000e(j), then such
hardship is sufficient, even if it consists of hardship on
employees. With these observations, I join the opinion of the
Court.
