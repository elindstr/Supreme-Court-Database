Clarke v. Bazadone
5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 212

ERROR TO THE GENERAL COURT OF THE
TERRITORY NORTHWEST OF THE RIVER OHIO
Syllabus 

															A writ of error does not lie from this Court to the general court of the territory northwest of the Ohio.

															This Court was established by an ordinance of the colonial Congress, during the confederation.  The only question decided in the case was whether the writ of error would lie.

															The writ of error was quashed on the ground that the act of Congress establishing the territory had not authorized an appeal or writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States.
