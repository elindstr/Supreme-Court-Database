CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
Syllabus 

															Decided on the authority of Helvering v. Northwest Steel Rolling Mills, ante p.  311 U. S. 46.

															105 F.2d 740 affirmed.

															Certiorari, 309 U.S. 692, to review the affirmance of a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, 38 B.T.A. 1355, which sustained the Commissioner's determination of a tax deficiency.

															MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.
