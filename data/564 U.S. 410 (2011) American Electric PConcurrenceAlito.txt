SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 10-174





															AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY, INC.,
et al., PETITIONERS v. CONNECTICUT et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

															[June 20, 2011]



															   Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															
   I concur in the judgment, and I agree with the Court’s displacement analysis on the assumption (which I make for the sake of argument because no party contends otherwise) that the interpretation of the Clean Air Act, 42 U. S. C. §7401 et seq., adopted by the majority in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U. S. 497 (2007), is correct.
