															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															MATTHEW ROBERT DESCAMPS, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 20, 2013]

															

															     Justice Thomas,
concurring in the judgment.

															     Petitioner Matthew
Descamps was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm,
18 U. S. C. §922(g), which subjected him to a
maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment. The District
Court, however, applied an Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA)
enhancement with a mandatory minimum of 15 years based in part on
Descamps’ earlier California conviction for burglary. See
§924(e). The California law says that any “person who
enters” any of a number of structures “with intent to
commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of
burglary.” California Penal Code Ann. §459 (West 2010).
That law does not, on its face, require the jury to determine
whether the entry itself was unlawful, a required element of the
so-called “generic” offense of burglary that qualifies
as an ACCA predicate. See Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S.
575, 599 (1990) . The majority holds that a court may not review
the underlying facts of Descamps’ state crime to determine
whether he entered the building unlawfully and, thus, that his
burglary conviction may not be used as a predicate offense under
ACCA. While I agree with the Court’s conclusion, I disagree
with its reasoning.

															     I have previously
explained that ACCA runs afoul of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530
U. S. 466 (2000) , because it allows the judge to
“mak[e] a finding that raises [a defendant’s] sentence
beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by
reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the
defendant.” James v. United States, 550 U. S. 192, 231
(2007) (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Under the logic of Apprendi, a court may not find facts about a
prior conviction when such findings increase the statutory maximum.
This is so whether a court is determining whether a prior
conviction was entered, see 530 U. S., at 520–521
(Thomas, J., concurring), or attempting to discern what facts were
necessary to a prior conviction. See James, su- pra, at
231–232 (Thomas, J., dissenting). In either case, the court
is inappropriately finding a fact that must be submitted to the
jury because it “increases the penalty for a crime beyond the
prescribed statutory maximum.” Apprendi, supra, at 490.

															     In light of the
foregoing, it does not matter whether a statute is
“divisible” or “indivisible,” see ante, at
1–2, and courts should not have to struggle with the contours
of the so-called “modified categorical” approach. Ibid.
The only reason Descamps’ ACCA enhancement is before us is
“because this Court has not yet reconsidered
Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998) ,
which draws an exception to the Apprendi line of cases for judicial
factfinding that concerns a defendant’s prior
convictions.” Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13, 27
(2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
Regardless of the framework adopted, judicial factfinding increases
the statutory maximum in violation of the Sixth Amendment. However,
because today’s opinion at least limits the situations in
which courts make factual determinations about prior convictions, I
concur in the judgment.
