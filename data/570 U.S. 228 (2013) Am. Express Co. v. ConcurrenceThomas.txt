															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 12–133

															_________________

															AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. ITALIAN COLORS RESTAURANT et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[June 20, 2013]

															

															     Justice Thomas,
concurring.

															     I join the
Court’s opinion in full. I write separately to note that the
result here is also required by the plain meaning of the Federal
Arbitration Act. In AT&T Mobil- ity LLC v. Concepcion, 563
U. S. ___ (2011), I explained that “the FAA requires
that an agreement to arbitrate be enforced unless a party
successfully challenges the forma- tion of the arbitration
agreement, such as by proving fraud or duress.” Id., at ___
(concurring opinion) (slip op., at 1–2). In this case,
Italian Colors makes two arguments to support its conclusion that
the arbitration agreement should not be enforced. First, it
contends that enforcing the arbitration agreement “would
contravene the policies of the antitrust laws.” Ante, at 4.
Second, it contends that a court may “invalidate agreements
that prevent the ‘ef- fective vindication’ of a federal
statutory right.” Ante, at 6. Neither argument
“concern[s] whether the contract was properly made,”
Concepcion, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at
5–6). Because Italian Colors has not furnished “grounds
. . . for the revocation of any contract,” 9
U. S. C. §2, the arbitration agreement must be
enforced. Italian Colors voluntarily entered into a con- tract
containing a bilateral arbitration provision. It cannot now escape
its obligations merely because the claim it wishes to bring might
be economically infeasible.
