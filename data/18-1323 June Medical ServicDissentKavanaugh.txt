															JUNE MEDICAL SERVICES L. L. C., et al.

															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 29, 2020]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, dissenting.

															I join Parts I, II, and III of Justice Alito’s dissent.  A threshold question in this case concerns the proper standard for evaluating state abortion laws.  The Louisiana law at issue here requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the abortion clinic.  The State asks us to assess the law by applying the undue burden standard of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,

505 U.S. 833 (1992).[1]  The plaintiffs ask us to apply the cost-benefit standard of Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. ___ (2016).

															Today, five Members of the Court reject the Whole Woman’s Health cost-benefit standard.  Ante, at 4–11 (Roberts, C. J., concurring in judgment); ante, at 14–20 (Thomas, J., dissenting); ante, at 4 (Alito, J., joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ., dissenting); ante, at 15–18 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  A different five Members of the Court conclude that Louisiana’s admitting-privileges law is unconstitutional because it “would restrict women’s access to abortion to the same degree as” the Texas law in Whole Woman’s Health.  Ante, at 12 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.); see also ante, at 16–40 (opinion of Breyer, J., joined by Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ.).

															I agree with the first of those two conclusions.  But I respectfully dissent from the second because, in my view, additional factfinding is necessary to properly evaluate Louisiana’s law.  As Justice Alito thoroughly and carefully explains, the factual record at this stage of plaintiffs’ facial, pre-enforcement challenge does not adequately demonstrate that the three relevant doctors (Does 2, 5, and 6) cannot obtain admitting privileges or, therefore, that any of the three Louisiana abortion clinics would close as a result of the admitting-privileges law.  I expressed the same concern about the incomplete factual record more than a year ago during the stay proceedings, and the factual record has not changed since then.  See June Medical Services, L.L.C. v. Gee, 586 U. S. ___ (2019) (opinion dissenting from grant of application for stay).  In short, I agree with Justice Alito that the Court should remand the case for a new trial and additional factfinding under the appropriate legal standards.[2]
Notes
1
 The State has not asked the Court to depart from the Casey standard. 

2
 In my view, the District Court on remand should also address the State’s new argument (raised for the first time in this Court) that these doctors and clinics lack third-party standing.
