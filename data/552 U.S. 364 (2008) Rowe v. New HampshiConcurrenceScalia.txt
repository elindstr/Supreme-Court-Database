NO. 06-457





															G. STEVEN ROWE, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MAINE,
PETITIONER v. NEW HAMPSHIRE MOTOR
TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the first circuit

															[February 20, 2008]



															   Justice Scalia, concurring in part.

															
   I join the opinion of the Court, except those portions (ante, at 4, 7, and 8) that rely on the reports of committees of one House of Congress to show the intent of that full House and of the other—with regard to propositions that are apparent from the text of the law, unnecessary to the disposition of the case, or both.
