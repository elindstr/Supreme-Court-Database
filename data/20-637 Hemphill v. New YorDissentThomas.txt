															DARRELL HEMPHILL, PETITIONER v. NEW YORK

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of new york

															[January 20, 2022]

															Justice Thomas, dissenting.

															This Court may review “[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State” only where, as relevant here, a federal right “is specially set up or claimed” in the state court.

28 U. S. C. §1257(a).  Because Darrell Hemphill did not raise his
 
Sixth Amendment claim in the New York Court of Appeals, we lack jurisdiction to review that court’s decision.  I respectfully dissent.

															I

															Under New York case law, a trial court may generally admit otherwise inadmissible evidence if a party has “opened the door” to its introduction at trial.  People v. Massie, 2 N.Y.3d 179, 180, 809 N.E.2d 1102 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A party “opens the door” when he presents “evidence or argument” that is “incomplete and misleading,” and responsive evidence is necessary to “correct the misleading impression.”  Id., at 184, 809 N. E. 2d, at 1105.  In People v. Reid, 19 N.Y.3d 382, 388, 971 N.E.2d 353, 357 (2012), the New York Court of Appeals held that this door-opening doctrine permits a trial court to admit testimonial hearsay otherwise barred by the
 
Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause.  In this case, invoking Reid, the trial court permitted the prosecution to introduce Nicholas Morris’ plea allocution to rebut Hemphill’s defense that Morris possessed the murder weapon.  See ante, at 3–5.

															Hemphill argues in this Court that the Reid rule violates the
 
Sixth Amendment.  That claim is not properly before us.  Under

28 U. S. C. §1257, “we will not consider a petitioner’s federal claim unless it was either addressed by or properly presented to the state court that rendered the decision we have been asked to review.”  Adams v. Robertson,

520 U.S. 83, 86 (1997) (per curiam).  When the state court does not “expressly address the question on which we granted certiorari,” but is instead “silent on [the] federal question before us, we assume that the issue was not properly presented.”  Ibid.  The petitioner then “bears the burden of . . . demonstrating that the state court had a fair opportunity to address the federal question that is sought to be presented.”  Id., at 87 (internal quotation marks omitted).

															The New York Court of Appeals did not address—“expressly” or otherwise, id., at 86—Hemphill’s
 
Sixth Amendment claim.  It affirmed the trial court’s application of Reid in a single sentence: “[T]he trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence that the allegedly culpable third party pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm other than the murder weapon.”  35 N.Y.3d 1035, 1036, 150 N. E. 3d 356, 358 (2020).  This lone sentence does not evince any awareness of, let alone respond to, a Confrontation Clause claim.  Because the Court of Appeals was “silent on [the] federal question before us,” Hemphill must prove that he afforded the state court a “fair opportunity” to address his current
 
Sixth Amendment claim.  Adams, 520 U. S., at 86–87 (internal quotation marks omitted).

															Hemphill does not meet that burden.  To provide the Court of Appeals with a “fair opportunity” to evaluate his
 
Sixth Amendment claim, Hemphill was required to raise that claim “with fair precision,” New York ex rel. Bryant v. Zimmerman,

278 U.S. 63, 67 (1928), and in an “unmistakable manner,” Dewey v. Des Moines,

173 U.S. 193, 198 (1899), such that “the mind of the state court was directed to [the federal] question,” Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio,

183 U.S. 238, 248 (1902); see also Marvin v. Trout,

199 U.S. 212, 223 (1905).  Put simply, there must have been a “real contest . . . upon” the federal claim in state court.  Morrison v. Watson,

154 U.S. 111, 115 (1894); accord, Illinois v. Gates,

462 U.S. 213, 222–223 (1983).

															Here, there was no contest upon any federal claim in the New York Court of Appeals.  In his briefing before that court, Hemphill asserted that the “only issue before [that] Court [was] whether the defense opened the door to Morris’s testimonial hearsay.”  App. 385 (emphasis added).  To that end, Hemphill argued that his defense’s presentation of evidence was not “misleading” under Massie, Reid, and other cases.  See App. 386–387.  Of course, whether Hemphill triggered New York’s “substantive principle of evidence,” ante, at 10, is a question of state law “not subject to review here,” Moore v. Illinois,

408 U.S. 786, 799 (1972); see also Hiawassee River Power Co. v. Carolina-Tennessee Power Co.,

252 U.S. 341, 343 (1920).  Federal law does not govern whether a defendant’s presentation of his case is “misleading.”  Thus, Hemphill pressed only a state-law claim in the New York Court of Appeals.

															True, Hemphill cited one
 
Sixth Amendment precedent, Crawford v. Washington,

541 U.S. 36 (2004), and stated that “the introduction of Morris’s guilty plea minutes violated [his]
 
Sixth Amendment right.”  App. 385.  But Hemphill reached that conclusion not because there was a “real contest . . . upon” the constitutionality of the Reid rule, Morrison, 154 U. S., at 115, but rather because the trial court misapplied Reid and thus improperly admitted unconfronted testimonial hearsay.  Put another way, Hemphill never argued that evidence that complied with Reid violated the Confrontation Clause.  To the contrary, Hemphill understood Reid to be constitutional.  As Hemphill explained, “both the trial judge and the Appellate Division recognized that [Morris’] statements would otherwise be barred by the Confrontation Clause” if he had not opened the door.  App. 385. (emphasis added).  In short, everyone agreed on what the
 
Sixth Amendment required; the only dispute was whether the trial court misapplied New York’s door-opening doctrine.

															The Court declines to address the substance of Hemphill’s argument in the Court of Appeals.  It focuses instead on Hemphill’s remark, toward the end of his analysis, that the Appellate Division’s ruling “unjustifiably undermine[d]” the right to confrontation and was “absurd in the context of the Confrontation Clause.”  Id., at 388.  But this was not a challenge to the constitutionality of the Reid rule; rather, it was an explanation why the Appellate Division’s approach to Reid represented “a radical shift never adopted by” the New York Court of Appeals in Reid or its progeny.  App. 388.  Hemphill repeated that charge at length in his reply brief.  See id., at 404–406.  Notably, he faulted the trial court for its “basic misunderstanding of the Reid doctrine.”  Id., at 406.  Thus, as before, Hemphill challenged only the misapplication of state law.

															Nonetheless, even if the Court were correct that Hemphill’s fleeting reference to the Confrontation Clause addressed the constitutionality of the Reid rule, Hemphill still would not have raised a “properly presented” federal claim under

28 U. S. C. §1257.  Adams, 520 U. S., at 86.  For more than a century, this Court has held that “[a] general statement that the decision of a court is against the constitutional rights of the objecting party . . . will not raise a federal question.”  Clarke v. McDade,

165 U.S. 168, 172 (1897); see also Chicago, I. & L. R. Co. v. McGuire,

196 U.S. 128, 131 (1905) (“mere suggestion of a violation of a Federal right”—rather than “the distinct presentation of a Federal question”—is inadequate).  A litigant must adequately develop any federal claim in his state briefing in order to give the state court a “fair opportunity” to assess the claim.  Adams, 520 U. S., at 87 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, the Court highlights two statements from Hemphill’s state-court briefing that, at best, offered a general and unreasoned assertion that the New York courts violated the
 
Sixth Amendment.  Such an unspecific statement manifestly failed to give the Court of Appeals a “fair opportunity” to assess any constitutional claim.

															The Court tacitly recognizes that its chosen excerpts from Hemphill’s brief are inadequate.  It asserts that Hemphill, after making those statements, “proceeded to explain” the basis for a Confrontation Clause claim.  Ante, at 8, n. 2.  The record demonstrates otherwise.  Hemphill did not cite a single case.  He made no legal argument.  In fact, he did not even address the right to confront adverse witnesses.  Rather, Hemphill lamented that, “[a]s a practical matter,” the Appellate Division’s approach “create[d] a minefield for counsel in which the only way for the accused to rely on the rules of evidence or constitutional protections is to remain mute.”  App. 388.  This general grievance about the inability to present evidence or argument in defense says nothing about the Confrontation Clause.  To the contrary, under our precedents, the right to present a defense in a state criminal trial is guaranteed by the
 
Sixth Amendment’s Compulsory Process Clause and the
 
Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.  See, e.g., Washington v. Texas,

388 U.S. 14, 19 (1967).  A claim under those provisions would not preserve a Confrontation Clause claim.  See Gates, 462 U. S., at 219–220.  It follows that Hemphill’s assertion about the practicalities of criminal defense, with no citation to any authority, is even more obviously inadequate.

															Ultimately, the Court all but concedes Hemphill’s failure to develop his claim below, but relies on Yee v. Escondido,

503 U.S. 519 (1992), for the proposition that we may “consider any argument Hemphill raises in support of his claim.”  Ante, at 7.  But Yee still requires a federal claim to be “properly presented” to the state court, even if a new argument in support of that claim is raised for the first time here.  503 U. S., at 534.  So, in Yee, the
 
Fifth Amendment taking claim was properly presented because the petitioners “unquestionably raised [that] claim in the state courts” based on a “physical taking argument,” and it was “unclear” only whether they also raised a related “regulatory taking” argument.  Ibid.  Here, by contrast, Hemphill developed no basis for any federal claim before the Court of Appeals.  Yee is therefore inapplicable and §1257 bars this Court’s review.

															II

															Hemphill’s failure to properly present his
 
Sixth Amendment claim to the New York Court of Appeals divests this Court of jurisdiction.  To be sure, on rare occasions, this Court has excused the failure to present a federal claim in state court.  See, e.g., Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C.,

476 U.S. 877, 883 (1986).  Our insistence on proper presentation has been “ ‘almost,’ ” though not completely, “ ‘unfailin[g].’ ”  Ante, at 6 (quoting Howell v. Mississippi,

543 U.S. 440, 443 (2005) (per curiam)).  But, in my view, the Court’s recent treatment of §1257’s proper-presentation requirement as merely prudential is erroneous.  We have no authority to forgive a petitioner’s failure to raise a federal claim in state court, because the proper-presentation requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review.  Absent jurisdiction, the only appropriate remedy is dismissal.[1]

															Since the Judiciary Act of 1789, §25,

1Stat.
85, Congress has permitted this Court to review the judgments of state courts only when petitioners properly present their federal claims to those courts below.  See Gates, 462 U. S., at 218.  This Court’s earliest cases held that the absence of a federal claim in the state court defeats this Court’s jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Owings v. Norwood’s Lessee, 5 Cranch 344, 347 (1809).  Justice Story explained: “[T]o give this court appellate jurisdiction two things should have occurred and be apparent in the record: first, that some one of the [federal] questions . . . did arise in the court below; and secondly, that a decision was actually made thereon by the same court.”  Crowell v. Randell, 10 Pet. 368, 392 (1836).[2]  That conclusion was unremarkable given that the proper- presentation requirement has always appeared in this Court’s only statutory grant of jurisdiction to review state-court decisions.

															For nearly 200 years, this Court adhered to the proper-presentation requirement as a jurisdictional rule.  The Court routinely dismissed cases for lack of jurisdiction when the petitioner failed to properly present his federal claim to the state court.  See, e.g., Oxley Stave Co. v. Butler County,

166 U.S. 648, 660 (1897); Cincinnati, N. O. &  T. P. R. Co. v. Slade,

216 U.S. 78, 83–84 (1910); Cardinale v. Louisiana,

394 U.S. 437, 439 (1969); see also Howell, 543 U. S., at 445 (noting “the long line of cases clearly stating that the presentation requirement is jurisdictional”).  Even a century ago, it was “well settled” that this Court was “without jurisdiction to review the judgment of a State court . . . by reason of a federal question which was not raised below or called to the attention of or decided by the State court.”  New York ex rel. Rosevale Realty Co. v. Kleinert,

268 U.S. 646, 650 (1925).

															Despite this long tradition, our more recent cases say it is “unsettled” whether the proper-presentation requirement is a jurisdictional bar or merely a prudential consideration.  E.g., Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Crenshaw,

486 U.S. 71, 79 (1988).  But the Court has never explained why it abandoned a centuries-old limit on our jurisdiction.  Two cases in the mid-20th century unsettled the doctrine with little justification.  First, in Terminiello v. Chicago,

337 U.S. 1 (1949), the petitioner raised a
 
First Amendment challenge to a city ordinance in state court, but failed to challenge the jury instruction interpreting that ordinance either below or in this Court.  The Court sidestepped the proper-presentation requirement by reading the jury instruction as a “construction of the ordinance . . . as binding on us as though the precise words had been written into the ordinance.”  Id., at 4.  Later, in Vachon v. New Hampshire,

414 U.S. 478 (1974) (per curiam), the Court deviated yet further from the jurisdictional understanding of the proper-presentation rule.  For the first time, and in an unreasoned footnote, the Court explicitly forgave a petitioner’s failure to present a federal claim to the state court.  See id., at 479, n. 3.  Other than Terminiello, the Court cited three cases that reviewed claims from federal court, see 414 U. S., at 483 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), where the requirement to present a federal claim has never been jurisdictional, see, e.g., Springfield v. Kibbe,

480 U.S. 257, 259 (1987) (per curiam).

															Since Vachon, the Court has not explained why the requirement to present a federal claim in state court is prudential rather than jurisdictional.  Instead, we have repeatedly ducked the issue.  See Howell, 543 U. S., at 445–446 (collecting cases).  I see no reason to prolong this Court’s ambivalence.  The proper-presentation requirement appears in the only statute that grants this Court jurisdiction to review state-court decisions.  For most of our history, that requirement was unfailingly understood to be jurisdictional.  And our cases have since departed from this principle without squaring that departure with §1257’s unqualified text.  Accordingly, I would hold that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear a federal claim on review from a state court where a petitioner, like Hemphill, fails to properly present his claim to the court below.

															III

															That the Court decides this case despite Hemphill’s failure to present his claim to the New York Court of Appeals is not a mere academic defect.  “Federal nullification of a state statute,” or any state rule, “is a grave matter.”  Maine v. Taylor,

477 U.S. 131, 135 (1986); see also Abbott v. Perez, 585 U. S. ___, ___, n. 17 (2018) (slip op., at 21, n. 17) (“the inability to enforce its duly enacted plans clearly inflicts irreparable harm on the State”).  And it is “unseemly in our dual system of government to disturb the finality of state judgments on a federal ground that the state court did not have occasion to consider.”  Adams, 520 U. S., at 90 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, it is “important that state courts be given the first opportunity to consider the applicability of state [rules],” particularly “in light of constitutional challenge, since the [rules] may be construed in a way which saves their constitutionality.”  Cardinale, 394 U. S., at 439.  A state court’s interest in deciding “whether to . . . amend [its] rules to avoid potential constitutional challenges” is “undeniable.”  Adams, 520 U. S., at 90.

															Today, the Court disregards these important “[p]rinciples of comity.”  Webb v. Webb,

451 U.S. 493, 499 (1981).  In the Court of Appeals, Hemphill argued that state law required “an affirmative attempt to mislead the jury . . . before the door can be opened to otherwise inadmissible evidence.”  App. 386.  Hemphill maintained that “[t]he doctrine is not so capacious as to allow the admission of any evidence made relevant by the opposing party’s strategy.”  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  But here, the Court describes Reid as permitting the prosecution to introduce all evidence that is “arguably relevant” to rebut the defendant’s “theory of defense.”  Ante, at 2.  The Court thus redefines Reid to be what Hemphill said it was not, and then holds that caricature of Reid unconstitutional without giving the Court of Appeals an opportunity to clarify its evidentiary rule in light of a concrete constitutional challenge.  Even if Massie, Reid, and their progeny do not clearly define what it means to “mislead” a jury, any uncertainty is all the more reason for this Court to refrain from deciding this case prematurely.  That the New York courts may clarify their doctrine in a later case does not forgive the Court’s impetuosity here.

															The Court’s neglect of our settled jurisdictional principles is particularly unfortunate in this case.  As Hemphill concedes, New York’s Appellate Division does not appear to apply the door-opening doctrine consistently.  See Reply Brief 10, n. 4.  Some cases hold that Massie and Reid do not permit the prosecution to introduce evidence merely to “counte[r] the defendant’s theory of the case.”  People v. Richardson, 95 App. Div. 3d 1039, 1040, 943 N.Y.S.2d 599, 600 (2012).  Others seem to apply the rule more aggressively.  See People v. Cole, 59 App. Div. 3d 302, 302–303, 873 N.Y.S.2d 603, 604 (2009).  Either way, the Court today purports to resolve what is effectively an intramural disagreement within the New York judiciary in order to reach a novel constitutional claim.  That task should—and under §1257’s jurisdictional bar, must—be left to the New York Court of Appeals in the first instance.

															*  *  *

															I would dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction under

28 U. S. C. §1257 because Hemphill did not raise his federal claim to the New York Court of Appeals.  I respectfully dissent.
Notes
1
 Even if the proper-presentation requirement were merely prudential, I still would dismiss this case, albeit as improvidently granted.  I see no reason to deviate from our “almost unfailin[g]” refusal to hear improperly presented federal claims.  Howell, 543 U. S., at 443.  In this case, like many others, “ ‘the circumstances . . . justify no exception.’ ”  Id., at 446 (collecting cases).  Particularly here, strong interests in comity counsel against hearing Hemphill’s
 
Sixth Amendment claim.  See Part III, infra. 

2
 Our later cases have stated this test in the disjunctive.  See Illinois v. Gates,

462 U.S. 213, 218, n. 1 (1983).  Because neither precondition is satisfied—Hemphill did not raise his
 
Sixth Amendment claim below, nor did the New York Court of Appeals address any such claim—I express no view on whether a federal claim must be both pressed and passed upon in the state court.
