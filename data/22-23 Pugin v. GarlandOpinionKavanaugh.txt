															FERNANDO CORDERO-GARCIA, aka FERNANDO
CORDERO

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 22, 2023]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Federal law provides that noncitizens convicted
of an “aggravated felony” are removable from the United
States. The definition of “aggravated felony” includes
federal or state offenses “relating to obstruction of
justice.” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(S). The
question here is whether an offense “relat[es] to obstruction
of justice” under §1101(a)(43)(S) even if the offense
does not require that an investigation or proceeding be
pending. That question arises because some obstruction
offenses can occur when an investigation or proceeding is not
pending, such as threatening a witness to prevent the witness from
reporting a crime to the police. We conclude that an offense may
“relat[e] to obstruction of justice” under
§1101(a)(43)(S) even if the offense does not require that an
investigation or proceeding be pending.

															I

															This case stems from two immigration
proceedings. Fernando Cordero-Garcia is a citizen of Mexico. In
2009, Cordero-Garcia was convicted of several California offenses,
including dissuading a witness from reporting a crime. Jean
Francois Pugin is a citizen of Mauritius. In 2014, Pugin was
convicted of the Virginia offense of being an accessory after the
fact to a felony.

															As relevant here, the U. S. Department of
Homeland Security charged both Cordero-Garcia and Pugin as
removable from the United States on the ground that they had
convictions for aggravated felonies—namely, offenses
“relating to obstruction of justice.” See 8
U. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(S), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).
In both cases, an Immigration Judge ruled for the Department, as
did the Board of Immigration Appeals.

															Cordero-Garcia and Pugin petitioned for review
in the relevant Courts of Appeals. In Cordero-Garcia’s case,
the Ninth Circuit concluded, in pertinent part, that his state
conviction for dissuading a witness from reporting a crime did not
constitute an offense “relating to obstruction of
justice” because the state offense did not require that an
investigation or proceeding be pending. 44 F. 4th 1181,
1188–1189 (2022). In Pugin’s case, by contrast, the
Fourth Circuit concluded that his state conviction for accessory
after the fact constituted an offense “relating to
obstruction of justice” even if the state offense did not
require that an investigation or proceeding be pending. 19
F. 4th 437, 450 (2021); see also Silva v.
Garland, 27 F. 4th 95, 98 (CA1 2022).

															This Court granted certiorari to resolve the
conflict in the Courts of Appeals. 598 U. S. ___ (2023).

															II

															Under the Immigration and Nationality Act,
noncitizens convicted of an “aggravated felony” are
removable from the United States. 8 U. S. C.
§1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The Act defines “aggravated
felony” to cover a broad range of federal and state crimes.
See §1101(a)(43).

															In 1996, Congress passed and President Clinton
signed legislation that expanded the definition of
“aggravated felony” to include offenses “relating
to obstruction of justice, perjury or subornation of perjury, or
bribery of a witness, for which the term of imprisonment is at
least one year.” §1101(a)(43)(S); 110 Stat. 1278;
id., at 3009–628.

															This Court has generally used the
“categorical approach” to determine whether a prior
conviction qualifies as an “aggravated felony” under
§1101(a)(43). Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, 581
U.S. 385, 389 (2017); Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S.
184, 190 (2013). Under that approach, courts look to “the
elements of the statute of conviction, not to the facts of each
defendant’s conduct.” Taylor v. United
States, 495 U.S.
575, 601 (1990). The Court’s role here is not to fashion
a separate federal obstruction offense, but rather to determine
which federal or state offenses “relat[e] to obstruction of
justice.”

															The question in this case is whether an offense
“relat[es] to obstruction of justice” under
§1101(a)(43)(S) even if the offense does not require that an
investigation or proceeding be pending. Dictionary
definitions, federal laws, state laws, and the Model Penal Code
show that the answer is yes: An offense “relat[es] to
obstruction of justice” even if the offense does not require
that an investigation or proceeding be pending.

															To begin, dictionaries from the time of
§1101(a)(43)(S)’s enactment in 1996 demonstrate that
obstruction of justice generally does not require a pending
investigation or proceeding. To take an illustrative formulation,
obstruction of justice covers “the crime or act of willfully
interfering with the process of justice and law,” including
“by influencing, threatening, harming, or impeding a witness,
potential witness, juror, or judicial or legal officer or by
furnishing false information in or otherwise impeding an
investigation or legal process.” Merriam-Webster’s
Dictionary of Law 337 (1996). The offense “captures every
willful act of corruption, intimidation, or force that tends
somehow to impair the machinery of the civil or criminal
law.” B. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 611 (2d
ed. 1995); see also Black’s Law Dictionary 1077 (6th ed.
1990) (“obstructing the administration of justice in any
way”); cf. Esquivel-Quintana, 581 U. S., at
391–392 (relying on same dictionaries to interpret a
different offense in §1101(a)(43)).

															Notably missing from those dictionary
definitions is a requirement that an investigation or proceeding be
pending. The dictionaries demonstrate that obstruction of justice
includes offenses where an investigation or proceeding is
pending, but is not limited to offenses where an
investigation or proceeding is pending.

															In accord with the dictionary definitions, Title
18 of the U. S. Code has long proscribed various obstruction
offenses that do not require a pending investigation or proceeding.
Entitled “Obstruction of Justice,” Chapter 73 of Title
18 houses many such offenses. For example, the federal witness
tampering statute covers various offenses, such as killing or
threatening a witness with an intent to prevent the person from
testifying at an official proceeding. See 18 U. S. C.
§§1512(a)(1)(A), (b)(1). That statute provides that
“an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be
instituted at the time of the offense.”
§1512(f )(1). Likewise, §1519 forbids assorted means
of destroying, altering, or falsifying records with an intent to
obstruct certain investigations or proceedings. That provision
covers acts intended to impede a federal investigation or
proceeding, “including one not even on the verge of
commencement.” Yates v. United States,
574 U.S.
528, 547 (2015) (plurality opinion); see also 18
U. S. C. §1518 (proscribing acts to obstruct the
communication of certain information to criminal
investigators).[1]

															The Solicitor General explains that many state
obstruction offenses as of 1996 similarly did not require that an
investigation or proceeding be pending. See, e.g., Fla.
Stat. §914.22(3)(a) (1997); N. D. Cent. Code Ann.
§12.1–09–01(3)(c) (1997); State v.
O’Neill, 165 Vt. 270, 
682 A.2d 943 (1996); Brief for Attorney General 36–43
(collecting statutes); see also Commonwealth v.
Berry, 141 Ky. 477, 481, 133 S.W. 212, 213 (1911); cf.
Esquivel-Quintana, 581 U. S., at 395–397 (looking
to state statutes). Some States did not label the relevant offenses
as “obstruction of justice,” but instead labeled the
offenses with a more precise term for the particular category of
obstruction at issue, such as witness tampering. But Congress
accounted for the variations in labels by crafting the relevant
definition in §1101(a)(43)(S) to cover offenses
“relating to obstruction of justice,” not just
offenses labeled as “obstruction of justice.” In any
event, the terminology that States use to categorize criminal
offenses is not dispositive because our inquiry here does not turn
on “technical definitions and labels under state law.”
Taylor, 495 U. S., at 590.

															For obstruction offenses, the Model Penal Code
also generally does not require that an investigation or proceeding
be pending. See generally ALI, Model Penal Code §240.0(4),
p. 3 (1980) (“ ‘official
proceeding[s]’ ” include those which “may be
heard”). For witness tampering, for example, the Model Penal
Code focuses on an actor’s intent to tamper with a witness,
not whether an investigation or proceeding is pending. See
id., §241.6, Comment 2, at 166–167 (“What
is important is not that the actor believe that an official
proceeding or investigation will begin within a certain span of
time but rather that he recognize that his conduct threatens
obstruction of justice”).

															That extensive body of
authority—dictionaries, federal laws, state laws, and the
Model Penal Code—reflects common sense. Individuals can
obstruct the process of justice even when an investigation or
proceeding is not pending. For example, a murderer may threaten to
kill a witness if the witness reports information to the police.
Such an act is no less obstructive merely because the government
has yet to catch on and begin an investigation. As the Solicitor
General persuasively states, one can obstruct the wheels of justice
even before the wheels have begun to move; indeed, obstruction of
justice is often “most effective” when it prevents
“an investigation or proceeding from commencing in the first
place.” Brief for Attorney General 15.

															Importantly, if an offense “relating to
obstruction of justice” under §1101(a)(43)(S) required
that an investigation or proceeding be pending, then many common
obstruction offenses would not qualify as aggravated felonies under
that provision. We decline to interpret §1101(a)(43)(S) to
exclude numerous heartland obstruction offenses. “We
should not lightly conclude that Congress enacted a self-defeating
statute.” Quarles v. United States, 587
U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 8); see also, e.g.,
Stokeling v. United States, 586 U. S. ___,
___–___ (2019) (slip op., at 7–8);
Esquivel-Quintana, 581 U. S., at 395; Voisine v.
United States, 579 U.S. 686, 695–696 (2016).

															One final point bears emphasis: To the extent
any doubt remains about whether §1101(a)(43)(S) requires that
an investigation or proceeding be pending, the phrase
“relating to obstruction of justice” resolves
the doubt. Cf. Mellouli v. Lynch, 575 U.S. 798,
811–812, n. 11 (2015). The phrase “relating
to” ensures that this statute covers offenses that have
“a connection with” obstruction of justice—which
surely covers common obstruction offenses that can occur when an
investigation or proceeding is not pending. Coventry Health Care
of Mo., Inc. v. Nevils, 581 U.S. 87, 96 (2017) (internal
quotation marks omitted). By contrast, in defining certain other
aggravated felonies in this statute, Congress did not employ the
broad phrase “relating to.” See, e.g., 8
U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(A) (“murder, rape, or
sexual abuse of a minor”).

															For all of those reasons, an offense
“relating to obstruction of justice” under
§1101(a)(43)(S) does not require that an investigation or
proceeding be pending.[2]

															III

															Pugin and Cordero-Garcia offer four main
arguments in response. None is persuasive.

															First, Pugin and Cordero-Garcia point to
18 U. S. C. §1503(a), which among other things
prohibits persons from endeavoring “to influence, obstruct,
or impede” the “due administration of justice.”
According to Pugin and Cordero-Garcia, that specific prohibition
requires that an investigation or proceeding be pending. Cf.
Pettibone v. United States, 148
U.S. 197, 207 (1893). But even if they are correct about that
point, §1503(a) is only one obstruction offense among the many
obstruction offenses in Title 18. And many federal obstruction
offenses—like many state obstruction offenses—proscribe
obstruction when an investigation or proceeding is not pending.
Moreover, if Congress wanted to define offenses “relating to
obstruction of justice” to have the same coverage as
§1503(a), Congress knew how to do so: Congress could have
cross-referenced §1503(a) in §1101(a)(43)(S) in the same
way that Congress cross-referenced numerous other statutes in
§1101(a)(43). See, e.g.,
§§1101(a)(43)(B)–(F). But Congress included no such
cross-reference to §1503(a) in §1101(a)(43)(S).

															Second, Pugin and Cordero-Garcia cite a
few authorities from the 1700s and 1800s and assert that
obstruction of justice historically required that an investigation
or proceeding be pending. But the historical record cited by Pugin
and Cordero-Garcia does not back up their broad claim. See,
e.g., 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England
126 (1769) (explaining without qualification that endeavoring
“to dissuade a witness from giving evidence” was an
“impedimen[t] of justice”). More to the point, as we
have explained at length, the widespread and contemporary
understanding of obstruction of justice at the time Congress
enacted §1101(a)(43)(S) in 1996 did not require that an
investigation or proceeding be pending. Cf. Taylor v.
United States, 495 U.S.
575, 593 (1990).

															Third, Pugin and Cordero-Garcia argue
that offenses “relating to obstruction of justice”
require a pending investigation or proceeding; otherwise, they
maintain that those offenses would be redundant with other offenses
covered by §1101(a)(43)(S)—in particular, offenses
“relating to . . . perjury or subornation of
perjury, or bribery of a witness.” But Pugin and
Cordero-Garcia fail to explain how requiring a pending
investigation or proceeding for obstruction offenses would resolve
the claimed redundancies with perjury or bribery offenses. After
all, perjury and bribery offenses often “relat[e] to
obstruction of justice.” In any event, “redundancies
are common in statutory drafting—sometimes in a congressional
effort to be doubly sure, sometimes because of congressional
inadvertence or lack of foresight, or sometimes simply because of
the shortcomings of human communication.” Barton v.
Barr, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 16). As a
result, “the better overall reading of the statute”
sometimes “contains some redundancy.” Ibid.;
Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Christian, 590 U. S.
___, ___, n. 5 (2020) (slip op., at 10, n. 5); Rimini
Street, Inc. v. Oracle USA, Inc., 586 U. S. ___,
___ (2019) (slip op., at 11). Section 1101(a)(43) illustrates the
point: Congress listed a large number of offenses that would
qualify as aggravated felonies, likely to avoid unintended gaps. So
it is not surprising to find some overlap. To take one example, the
definition of “aggravated felony” covers “murder,
rape, or sexual abuse of a minor” and separately covers
“crime[s] of violence.” §§1101(a)(43)(A),
(F).[3]

															Fourth, Pugin and Cordero-Garcia invoke
the rule of lenity. But even assuming that the rule of lenity can
be invoked in this particular civil immigration context, the rule
applies only if “after seizing everything from which aid can
be derived,” there remains “grievous ambiguity.”
Ocasio v. United States, 578 U.S. 282, 295, n. 8
(2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, applying the
traditional tools of statutory interpretation, we have concluded
that an offense “relating to obstruction of justice”
does not require that an investigation or proceeding be pending. So
we have no basis for resorting to the rule of lenity. See,
e.g., Shaw v. United States, 580 U.S. 63, 71
(2016); Salman v. United States, 580 U.S. 39, 51
(2016); Abramski v. United States, 573 U.S.
169, 188, n. 10 (2014); cf. Kawashima v.
Holder, 565 U.S.
478, 489 (2012).

															*  *  *

															In sum, we conclude that an offense
“relating to obstruction of justice” under
§1101(a)(43)(S) does not require that an investigation or
proceeding be pending. We therefore disagree with the argument
raised by Pugin and Cordero-Garcia for excluding their obstruction
offenses from the broad coverage of §1101(a)(43)(S). We affirm
the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit. We reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 To be sure, one of those
offenses—18 U. S. C. §1519—was enacted
after the passage of §1101(a)(43)(S) in its current form in
1996. But §1519, too, reflects the longstanding ordinary
understanding of obstruction of justice—and no one here
suggests that the ordinary understanding in the years after 1996
somehow differed from the ordinary understanding in 1996. See
Branch v. Smith, 538 U.S.
254, 281 (2003) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (“the
most rudimentary rule of statutory construction” is
“that courts do not interpret statutes in isolation, but in
the context of the corpus juris of which they are a part,
including later-enacted statutes”).
2
 As interpreted by this
Court, a few obstruction statutes require that an investigation or
proceeding be reasonably foreseeable. See, e.g.,
Marinello v. United States, 584 U. S. ___, ___
(2018) (slip op., at 11). Those decisions interpreted specific
statutory language and did not rule that obstruction offenses in
general have a foreseeability requirement (which would have been
incorrect, in any event). Moreover, the Solicitor General explains
that offenses “relating to obstruction of justice”
require an intent to interfere with the legal process. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 6–8, 18, 116–117; Brief for Attorney General
23. That mens rea requirement targets the same basic
overbreadth concern as a foreseeability requirement and ensures
that §1101(a)(43)(S) will not sweep in offenses that are not
properly understood as offenses “relating to obstruction of
justice.” For example, the Solicitor General concedes that
federal misprision of felony is not an offense “relating to
obstruction of justice” because, in the Government’s
view, the crime does not require an intent to interfere with the
legal process. See 18 U. S. C. §4; Reply Brief for
Attorney General 26–27. In short, we see no justification for
engrafting a separate foreseeability requirement onto the broad and
general language of §1101(a)(43)(S).
3
 The same point applies to
§1101(a)(15)(U)(iii), which lists both “obstruction of
justice” and “witness tampering.” Neither Pugin
nor Cordero-Garcia cites that provision—presumably because
the provision appears in a different part of the statute and
contains different language. Moreover, Congress took the same
belt-and-suspenders approach in §1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) that it
did in §1101(a)(43). See §1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) (covering
among other things “being held hostage; peonage; involuntary
servitude; slave trade; kidnapping; abduction; unlawful criminal
restraint; false imprisonment” as well as “any similar
activity in violation of Federal, State, or local criminal
law”).
