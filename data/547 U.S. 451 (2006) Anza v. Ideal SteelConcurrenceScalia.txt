SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 04-433





															JOSEPH ANZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. IDEAL STEEL
SUPPLY CORP.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

															[June 5, 2006]



															   Justice Scalia, concurring.

															
   I join the opinion of the Court.  I also note that it is inconceivable that the injury alleged in the 18 U. S. C. §1962(c) claim at issue here is within the zone of interests protected by the RICO cause of action for fraud perpetrated upon New York State.  See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 286–290 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).
