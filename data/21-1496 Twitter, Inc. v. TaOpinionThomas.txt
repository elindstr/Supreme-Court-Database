															Twitter, Inc., PETITIONER v. Mehier
Taamneh, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 18, 2023]

															

															Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Under 18 U. S. C. §2333, United
States nationals who have been “injured . . . by
reason of an act of international terrorism” may sue for
damages. §2333(a). They are not limited to suing the
individual terrorists or organizations that directly carried out
the attack, however. That is because §2333(d)(2) also imposes
civil liability on “any person who aids and abets, by
knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with
the person who committed such an act of international
terrorism.” Victims of terrorist acts therefore may seek to
recover from those who aided and abetted the terrorist act that
injured them.

															The plaintiffs (who are respondents) contend
that they have stated a claim for relief under §2333(d)(2).
They were allegedly injured by a terrorist attack carried out by
ISIS. But plaintiffs are not suing ISIS. Instead, they have brought
suit against three of the largest social-media companies in the
world—Facebook, Twitter (who is petitioner), and Google
(which owns YouTube)—for allegedly aiding and abetting ISIS.
As plaintiffs allege, ISIS has used defendants’ social-media
platforms to recruit new terrorists and to raise funds for
terrorism. Defendants allegedly knew that ISIS was using their
platforms but failed to stop it from doing so. Plaintiffs
accordingly seek to hold Facebook, Twitter, and Google liable for
the terrorist attack that allegedly injured them. We conclude,
however, that plaintiffs’ allegations are insufficient to
establish that these defendants aided and abetted ISIS in carrying
out the relevant attack.

															I

															Plaintiffs’ case arises from a 2017
terrorist attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey. The
attack was carried out by Abdulkadir Masharipov on behalf of the
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).[1] Born in Uzbekistan, Masharipov had received military
training with al Qaeda in Afghanistan in 2011 and eventually became
affiliated with ISIS. In 2016, he was ordered by ISIS to travel to
Turkey and launch an attack in Istanbul on New Year’s Eve.
After planning and coordinating the attack with ISIS emir Abu
Shuhada, Masharipov entered the Reina nightclub in the early hours
of January 1, 2017, and fired over 120 rounds into a crowd of more
than 700 people. In total, Masharipov killed 39 people and injured
69 others. The next day, ISIS released a statement claiming
responsibility for the attack. Two weeks later, Masharipov was
arrested in Istanbul after hiding out in ISIS safe houses.

															One of Masharipov’s victims was Nawras
Alassaf, who was killed in the attack. Several members of
Alassaf ’s family then brought the present lawsuit under
§2333, alleging that they had been injured by the
attack.[2] Invoking
§2333(d)(2), plaintiffs sued three major social-media
companies—Facebook, Inc., Google, Inc., and Twitter,
Inc.—claiming that they aided and abetted ISIS and thus were
liable for the Reina nightclub attack.[3]

															As is common knowledge, these three companies
control three of the largest and most ubiquitous platforms on the
internet: Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. At the time of the Reina
attack, Facebook had over 2 billion active users each month,
YouTube had over 1 billion, and Twitter had around 330 million. See
Facebook, Inc., Form 10–K for Fiscal Year Ended Dec. 31,
2017, p. 34; Twitter, Inc., Form 10–K for Fiscal Year Ended
Dec. 31, 2017, p. 47; YouTube, YouTube Hits a Billion Monthly Users
(Mar. 21, 2013),
https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/onebillionstrong. At least for
Facebook and YouTube, those numbers are even higher today. See Meta
Platforms, Inc., Form 10–K for Fiscal Year Ended Dec. 31,
2022, p. 56 (nearly 3 billion); L. Ceci, Statista,
YouTube–Statistics & Facts (Mar. 22, 2023),
https://www.statista.com/topics/2019/youtube/ #topicOverview (2.56
billion).

															Everyone before us today agrees on the basic
aspects of these platforms’ business models. People from
around the world can sign up for the platforms and start posting
content on them, free of charge and without much (if any) advance
screening by defendants. Once on the platforms, users can upload
messages, videos, and other types of content, which others on the
platform can then view, respond to, and share. As noted above,
billions of people have done just that. As a result, the amount of
content on defendants’ platforms is staggering. It appears
that for every minute of the day, approximately 500 hours of
video are uploaded to YouTube, 510,000 comments are posted on
Facebook, and 347,000 tweets are sent on Twitter. See Statista,
Media Usage in an Internet Minute as of April 2022 (2023),
https://www.statista.com/statistics/195140/new-user-
generated-content-uploaded-by-users-per-minute; Statista,
YouTube–Statistics & Facts; B. Marr, How Much Data Do We
Create Every Day? Forbes, May 21, 2018. On YouTube alone, users
collectively watch more than 1 billion hours of video every
day. See YouTube Advertising, Reach Your Customers—and
Discover New Ones, https://youtube.com/
intl/en_us/ads/how-it-works/set-up-a-campaign/audience.

															Defendants profit from this content largely by
charging third parties to advertise on their platforms. Those
advertisements are placed on or near the billions of videos, posts,
comments, and tweets uploaded by the platforms’ users. To
organize and present all those advertisements and pieces of
content, defendants have developed “recommendation”
algorithms that automatically match advertisements and content with
each user; the algorithms generate those outputs based on a wide
range of information about the user, the advertisement, and the
content being viewed. So, for example, a person who watches cooking
shows on YouTube is more likely to see cooking-based videos and
advertisements for cookbooks, whereas someone who likes to watch
professorial lectures might see collegiate debates and
advertisements for TED Talks.

															But not all of the content on defendants’
platforms is so benign. As plaintiffs allege, ISIS and its
adherents have used these platforms for years as tools for
recruiting, fundraising, and spreading their propaganda. Like many
others around the world, ISIS and its supporters opened accounts on
Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter and uploaded videos and messages for
others to see. Like most other content on those platforms,
ISIS’ videos and messages were then matched with other users
based on those users’ information and use history. And, like
most other content, advertisements were displayed with ISIS’
messages, posts, and videos based on information about the viewer
and the content being viewed. Unlike most other content, however,
ISIS’ videos and messages celebrated terrorism and recruited
new terrorists. For example, ISIS uploaded videos that fundraised
for weapons of terror and that showed brutal executions of soldiers
and civilians alike. And plaintiffs allege that these platforms
have been crucial to ISIS’ growth, allowing it to reach new
audiences, gain new members, and spread its message of terror.

															Plaintiffs also allege that defendants have
known that ISIS has used their platforms for years. Yet, plaintiffs
claim that defendants have failed to detect and remove a
substantial number of ISIS-related accounts, posts, and videos.
(For example, plaintiffs aver that defendants “have failed to
implement . . . a basic account detection
methodology” to prevent ISIS supporters from generating
multiple accounts on their platforms. App. 150.) Accordingly,
plaintiffs assert that defendants aided and abetted ISIS by
knowingly allowing ISIS and its supporters to use their platforms
and benefit from their “recommendation” algorithms,
enabling ISIS to connect with the broader public, fundraise, and
radicalize new recruits. And, in the process, defendants allegedly
have profited from the advertisements placed on ISIS’ tweets,
posts, and videos.

															Plaintiffs also provide a set of allegations
specific to Google. According to plaintiffs, Google has established
a system that shares revenue gained from certain advertisements on
YouTube with users who posted the videos watched with the
advertisement. As part of that system, Google allegedly reviews and
approves certain videos before Google permits ads to accompany that
video. Plaintiffs allege that Google has reviewed and approved at
least some ISIS videos under that system, thereby sharing some
amount of revenue with ISIS.

															The District Court dismissed plaintiffs’
complaint for failure to state a claim.[4] But the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that plaintiffs
had plausibly alleged that defendants aided and abetted ISIS within
the meaning of §2333(d)(2) and thus could be held secondarily
liable for the Reina nightclub attack. Gonzalez v.
Google, 2 F. 4th 871 (2021). We granted certiorari to
resolve whether plaintiffs have adequately stated such a claim
under §2333(d)(2). See 598 U. S. ___ (2022).

															II

															Section 2333 was originally enacted as part of
the Antiterrorism Act (ATA) in 1990. 104Stat. 2250. At that time,
Congress authorized United States nationals or their “estate,
survivors, or heirs” to bring civil lawsuits when
“injured in [their] person, property, or business by reason
of an act of international terrorism.” Id., at
2251.[5] In such a lawsuit, the
plaintiff could recover treble damages and the cost of the suit,
including attorney’s fees. See 18 U. S. C.
§2333(a). But the ATA did not explicitly impose liability on
anyone who only helped the terrorists carry out the attack or
conspired with them. Prior to 2016, some courts accordingly
determined that the ATA did not authorize that sort of secondary
civil liability. See, e.g., Rothstein v. UBS
AG, 708 F.3d 82, 97–98 (CA2 2013).

															Then, in 2016, Congress enacted the Justice
Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) to provide for a form of
secondary civil liability. 130Stat. 852. Thus, as the law now
stands, those injured by an act of international terrorism can sue
the relevant terrorists directly under §2333(a)—or they
can sue anyone “who aids and abets, by knowingly providing
substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person who
committed such an act of international terrorism” under
§2333(d)(2). For such a secondary-liability claim, there is an
additional condition: The “act of international
terrorism” must have been “committed, planned, or
authorized by an organization that had been designated as a foreign
terrorist organization under [ 8 U. S. C. §1189] as
of the date on which such act of international terrorism was
committed, planned, or authorized.” Ibid. Plaintiffs
seeking secondary liability can likewise recover treble damages and
the cost of the suit, including attorney’s fees. See
§§2333(a), (d)(2).

															The parties here do not dispute that the first
three components of §2333(d)(2) have been adequately alleged:
The Reina nightclub attack was an “act of international
terrorism”; the attack was “committed, planned, or
authorized” by ISIS; and ISIS was “designated as a
foreign terrorist organization” as of the date of the Reina
nightclub attack. §2333(d)(2). The central question is thus
whether defendants’ conduct constitutes “aid[ing] and
abett[ing], by knowingly providing substantial assistance,”
such that they can be held liable for the Reina nightclub attack.
Ibid.

															III

															As always, we start with the text of
§2333. See Bartenwerfer v. Buckley, 598 U.S. 69,
74 (2023). Here, that text immediately begs two questions: First,
what exactly does it mean to “aid and abet”? Second,
what precisely must the defendant have “aided and
abetted”?

															A

															We turn first to the meaning of the phrase
“aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial
assistance.” Nothing in the statute defines any of those
critical terms. Yet terms like “aids and abets” are
familiar to the common law, which has long held aiders-and-abettors
secondarily liable for the wrongful acts of others. See Central
Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.
A., 511 U.S.
164, 181 (1994). We generally presume that such common-law
terms “brin[g] the old soil” with them. Sekhar
v. United States, 570 U.S.
729, 733 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). In enacting
JASTA, Congress provided additional context by pointing to
Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (CADC 1983), as
“provid[ing] the proper legal framework” for
“civil aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability.”
§2(a)(5), 130Stat. 852.[6]
We thus begin with Halberstam’s “legal
framework,” viewed in context of the common-law tradition
from which it arose.

															1

															Long regarded as a leading case on civil
aiding-and- abetting and conspiracy liability, see 130Stat. 852,
Halberstam arose from a distinctive fact pattern. Bernard
Welch was a serial burglar who had killed Michael Halberstam during
a break-in. 705 F. 2d, at 474. Halberstam’s estate then
sued Welch’s live-in partner, Linda Hamilton, for aiding and
abetting and conspiring with Welch. Id., at 474,
476.[7] Hamilton was not
present for Halberstam’s murder, or even allegedly aware of
the murder. See id., at 474–476. But the facts made
clear that “[s]he was a willing partner in [Welch’s]
criminal activities.” Id., at 474 (internal quotation
marks omitted). Hamilton had lived with Welch for five years,
during which time the couple had risen from modest circumstances to
possess a substantial fortune. Ibid. This rapid ascent was
remarkable because Welch had no outside employment. Id., at
475. Rather, he left the house most evenings and returned
with antiques, jewelry, and precious metals—some of which he
melted down into gold and silver ingots by using a smelting furnace
that he had installed in their garage. Meanwhile, Hamilton did
bookkeeping work for Welch’s “business,”
facilitating the sale of those stolen goods. Ibid. She had
Welch’s customers make checks payable to her, falsified her
tax returns at Welch’s direction, and kept records of
incoming payments from Welch’s customers—with no
records of outgoing funds to his “suppliers.”
Ibid. Their arrangement continued until Welch was arrested
after he killed Halberstam while burglarizing Halberstam’s
home. Ibid.

															To determine Hamilton’s liability, the
D. C. Circuit undertook an extensive survey of the common law,
examining a series of state and federal cases, the Restatement
(Second) of Torts, and prominent treatises that discussed secondary
liability in tort. Id., at 476–478, 481–486.
With respect to aiding and abetting, the court synthesized the
cases as resting on three main elements: First, “the party
whom the defendant aids must perform a wrongful act that causes an
injury.” Id., at 477. Second, “the defendant
must be generally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal
or tortious activity at the time that he provides the
assistance.” Ibid. And, third, “the defendant
must knowingly and substantially assist the principal
violation.” Ibid. (citing, e.g., Landy
v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 486 F.2d 139, 162–163
(CA3 1973); Woodward v. Metro Bank of Dallas, 522
F.2d 84, 94–95 (CA5 1975)). Halberstam then
articulated six factors to help determine whether a
defendant’s assistance was “substantial.” 705 F.
2d, at 486–488. Those factors are (1) “the nature of
the act assisted,” (2) the “amount of assistance”
provided, (3) whether the defendant was “present at the
time” of the principal tort, (4) the defendant’s
“relation to the tortious actor,” (5) the
“defendant’s state of mind,” and (6) the
“duration of the assistance” given. Id., at 488
(emphasis deleted). Last, Halberstam clarified that those
who aid and abet “a tortious act may be liable” not
only for the act itself but also “for other reasonably
foreseeable acts done in connection with it.” Id., at
484.

															Applying that framework, the D. C. Circuit
held that Hamilton was liable for aiding and abetting
Halberstam’s murder. Id., at 489.[8] The court first determined that Welch had
committed a wrong (in killing Halberstam during the burglary) and
that Hamilton was generally aware of her role in Welch’s
criminal enterprise. Id., at 488. It then explained that
Hamilton had given knowing and substantial assistance to
Welch’s activities by helping him turn his “stolen
goods into ‘legitimate’ wealth,” thereby
intending to help Welch succeed by performing a function crucial to
any thief. Ibid. And it clarified that Hamilton knew Welch
was committing some sort of “personal property crime,”
the “foreseeable risk” of which was “violence and
killing.” Ibid. The court therefore concluded that
Hamilton substantially helped Welch commit personal property crimes
and was liable for Halberstam’s death, which was a
foreseeable result of such crimes. Ibid.

															That articulation of the common law thus
resolved Halberstam. But Halberstam recognized that
the elements and factors it provided could “be merged or
articulated somewhat differently without affecting their basic
thrust.” Id., at 478, n. 8. It thus
cautioned—in a typical common-law fashion—that its
formulations should “not be accepted as immutable
components.” Id., at 489. Rather, Halberstam
suggested that its framework should be “adapted as new cases
test their usefulness in evaluating vicarious liability.”
Ibid.

															2

															The allegations before us today are a far cry
from the facts of Halberstam. Rather than dealing with a
serial burglar and his live-in partner-in-crime, we are faced with
international terrorist networks and world-spanning internet
platforms. By Halberstam’s own lights, its precise
three-element and six-factor test thus may not be entirely adequate
to resolve these new facts. Ibid. And JASTA itself points
only to Halberstam’s “framework,” not its
facts or its exact phrasings and formulations, as the benchmark for
aiding and abetting. §2(a)(5), 130Stat. 852. We therefore must
ascertain the “basic thrust” of
Halberstam’s elements and determine how to
“adap[t]” its framework to the facts before us today.
See 705 F. 2d, at 478, 489, and n. 8. To do so, we turn
to the common law of aiding and abetting upon which
Halberstam rested and to which JASTA’s common-law
terminology points.

															As we have recognized, “[a]iding and
abetting is an ancient criminal law doctrine” that has
substantially influenced its analog in tort. Central Bank of
Denver, 511 U. S., at 181. In one early statement of the
criminal-law doctrine, William Blackstone explained that those who
were “present, aiding and abetting the fact to be
done,” or “procure[d], counsel[ed], or command[ed]
another to commit a crime,” were guilty and punishable. 4
Commentaries on the Laws of England 34, 36 (1795). Over the years,
many statutes and courts have offered variations on that basic
rule. See United States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d 401, 402
(CA2 1938) (L. Hand, J., for the court) (collecting authorities).
Yet, to this day, the basic “view of culpability” that
animates the doctrine is straightforward: “[A] person may be
responsible for a crime he has not personally carried out if he
helps another to complete its commission.” Rosemond v.
United States, 572 U.S.
65, 70 (2014).

															Importantly, the concept of
“helping” in the commission of a crime—or a
tort—has never been boundless. That is because, if it were,
aiding-and-abetting liability could sweep in innocent bystanders as
well as those who gave only tangential assistance. For example,
assume that any assistance of any kind were sufficient to create
liability. If that were the case, then anyone who passively watched
a robbery could be said to commit aiding and abetting by failing to
call the police. Yet, our legal system generally does not impose
liability for mere omissions, inactions, or nonfeasance; although
inaction can be culpable in the face of some independent duty to
act, the law does not impose a generalized duty to rescue. See 1 W.
LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §6.1 (3d ed. 2018) (LaFave);
W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton
on Law of Torts 373–375 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser &
Keeton). Moreover, both criminal and tort law typically sanction
only “wrongful conduct,” bad acts, and misfeasance. J.
Goldberg, A. Sebok, & B. Zipursky, Tort Law: Responsibilities
and Redress 31 (2004). Some level of blameworthiness is therefore
ordinarily required. But, again, if aiding-and-abetting liability
were taken too far, then ordinary merchants could become liable for
any misuse of their goods and services, no matter how attenuated
their relationship with the wrongdoer. And those who merely deliver
mail or transmit emails could be liable for the tortious messages
contained therein. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §876,
Comment d, Illus. 9, p. 318 (1979) (cautioning against this
result).

															For these reasons, courts have long recognized
the need to cabin aiding-and-abetting liability to cases of truly
culpable conduct. They have cautioned, for example, that not
“all those present at the commission of a trespass are liable
as principals” merely because they “make no opposition
or manifest no disapprobation of the wrongful” acts of
another. Brown v. Perkins, 83 Mass. 89, 98 (1861);
see also Hilmes v. Stroebel, 59 Wis. 74, 17 N.W. 539
(1883); Duke v. Feldman, 245 Md. 454, 457–458,
226 A.2d 345, 347 (1967). Put another way, overly broad liability
would allow for “one person [to] be made a trespasser and
even a felon against his or her consent, and by the mere rashness
or precipitancy or overheated zeal of another.” Bird
v. Lynn, 49 Ky. 422, 423 (1850). Moreover, unlike its close
cousin conspiracy, aiding and abetting does not require any
agreement with the primary wrongdoer to commit wrongful acts, thus
eliminating a significant limiting principle. See Nye &
Nissen v. United States, 336
U.S. 613, 620 (1949).

															To keep aiding-and-abetting liability grounded
in culpable misconduct, criminal law thus requires “that a
defendant ‘in some sort associate himself with the venture,
that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring
about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed’ ”
before he could be held liable. Id., at 619 (quoting
Peoni, 100 F. 2d, at 402). In other words, the
defendant has to take some “affirmative act”
“with the intent of facilitating the offense’s
commission.” Rosemond, 572 U. S., at 71. Such
intentional participation can come in many forms, including
abetting, inducing, encouraging, soliciting, or advising the
commission of the offense, such as through words of encouragement
or driving the getaway car. 2 LaFave §13.2(a), at
457–460; see also J. Hawley & M. McGregor, The Criminal
Law 81 (3d ed. 1899). Regardless of the particulars, however, it is
clear that some culpable conduct is needed. See Rosemond,
572 U. S., at 73, 77.[9]

															Similar principles and concerns have shaped
aiding-and-abetting doctrine in tort law, with numerous cases
directly employing them to help articulate the standard for
tortious aiding and abetting. See, e.g., Zoelsch v.
Arthur Andersen & Co., 824 F.2d 27, 35–36 (CADC
1987); Woodward, 522 F. 2d, at 95, n. 23; Landy,
486 F. 2d, at 163–164 (all relying on Nye &
Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619); see also Camp v.
Dema, 948 F.2d 455, 459 (CA8 1991) (relying on People
v. Terman, 
4 Cal. App. 2d 345, 346–347 (1935), another criminal
case). Similar to the criminal-law rule, some cases have required
that the defendant’s assistance “must have had a direct
relation to the trespass, and have been calculated and intended to
produce it” to warrant liability for the resulting tort.
Bird, 49 Ky., at 423; see also Smith v.
Thompson, 103 Idaho 909, 911, 655 P.2d 116, 118 (App. 1982);
Brown, 83 Mass., at 98. Other cases have emphasized the need
for some “culpable conduct” and “some degree of
knowledge that [a defendant’s] actions are aiding the primary
violator” before holding the defendant secondarily liable.
Camp, 948 F. 2d, at 460. Still others have explained
that “[c]ulpability of some sort is necessary to justify
punishment of a secondary actor,” lest mostly passive actors
like banks become liable for all of their customers’ crimes
by virtue of carrying out routine transactions. Monsen v.
Consolidated Dressed Beef Co., 579 F.2d 793, 799 (CA3 1978).
And others have suggested that “inaction cannot create
liability as an aider and abettor” absent a duty to act.
Zoelsch, 824 F. 2d, at 36; see also Woodward,
522 F. 2d, at 96.

															In articulating those limits, courts
simultaneously began to crystalize the framework for aiding and
abetting that Halberstam identified and applied. See,
e.g., Monsen, 579 F. 2d, at 799 (stating a
similar three-part test).[10] As in Halberstam, that framework generally
required what the text of §2333(d)(2) demands: that the
defendant have given knowing and substantial assistance to the
primary tortfeasor. See, e.g., Monsen, 579
F. 2d, at 799; Landy, 486 F. 2d, at 162–163.
Notably, courts often viewed those twin requirements as working in
tandem, with a lesser showing of one demanding a greater showing of
the other. E.g., Woodward, 522 F. 2d, at 97;
Woods v. Barnette Bank of Ft. Lauderdale, 765 F.2d
1004, 1010 (CA11 1985). In other words, less substantial assistance
required more scienter before a court could infer conscious and
culpable assistance. See Woodward, 522 F. 2d, at 97.
And, vice versa, if the assistance were direct and extraordinary,
then a court might more readily infer conscious participation in
the underlying tort. See ibid. In moving back and forth
between all these guideposts, the courts thus largely tracked the
same distinctions drawn above to ensure that liability fell only on
those who had abetted the underlying tort through conscious,
“culpable conduct.” Camp, 948 F. 2d, at
460.

															3

															Halberstam’s framework reflected
and distilled those common-law principles. Indeed,
Halberstam started with a survey of many earlier common-law
cases, including many of the same cases cited above. 705
F. 2d, at 477, 483 (citing, e.g., Woodward, 522
F. 2d, at 94–95; Landy, 486 F. 2d, at
162–163; Duke, 245 Md., at 457–458, 226
A. 2d, at 347). As part of that survey, Halberstam
explicitly distinguished different types of aid along the same
culpability axis that grounded the common law. 705 F. 2d, at
481–483. For example, Halberstam recognized that
giving verbal encouragement (such as yelling
“ ‘Kill him!’ ”) could be
substantial assistance, id., at 481, but that passively
watching an assault after hearing an assailant threaten the victim
likely would not be, id., at 483. Those same lines have long
been drawn for aiding-and-abetting liability under the common law.
See Rosemond, 572 U. S., at 70; see also, e.g.,
2 LaFave §13.2(a), at 457–460; Restatement (Second) of
Torts §876, Comment d, Illus. 9–10, at 318;
Brown, 83 Mass., at 98. And Halberstam’s six
factors for “substantial assistance” call for the same
balancing that courts had undertaken previously between the nature
and amount of assistance on the one hand and the defendant’s
scienter on the other. 705 F. 2d, at 484–485,
487–488.

															Despite that deep-rooted common-law basis, the
Ninth Circuit appears to have understood JASTA’s approval of
Halberstam’s “legal framework” as
requiring it to hew tightly to the precise formulations that
Halberstam used. The parties before us similarly make a
conscious effort to draw analogies to the facts of that case. But
any approach that too rigidly focuses on Halberstam’s
facts or its exact phraseology risks missing the mark.
Halberstam is by its own terms a common-law case and
provided its elements and factors as a way to synthesize the
common-law approach to aiding and abetting. And JASTA employs the
common-law terms “aids and abets,” pointing to
Halberstam’s common-law “framework” as the
primary guidepost for understanding the scope of
§2333(d)(2).

															At bottom, both JASTA and
Halberstam’s elements and factors rest on the same
conceptual core that has animated aiding-and-abetting liability for
centuries: that the defendant consciously and culpably
“participate[d]” in a wrongful act so as to help
“make it succeed.” Nye & Nissen, 336
U. S., at 619. To be sure, nuances may establish daylight
between the rules for aiding and abetting in criminal and tort law;
we have described the doctrines as “rough[ly]
simila[r],” not identical. Central Bank of Denver, 511
U. S., at 181. But we need not resolve the extent of those
differences today; it is enough for our purposes to recognize the
framework that Halberstam set forth and the basis on which
it rests. The phrase “aids and abets” in
§2333(d)(2), as elsewhere, refers to a conscious, voluntary,
and culpable participation in another’s wrongdoing.

															B

															The next question, however, is what precisely
a defendant must aid and abet. As noted above, JASTA imposes
liability on anyone “who aids and abets, by knowingly
providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person
who committed such an act of international terrorism.”
§2333(d)(2). The parties vigorously dispute the textual object
of the term “aids and abets”: Plaintiffs assert that it
is “the person,” and defendants insist that it is the
“act of international terrorism.” So, plaintiffs
contend, defendants can be liable if they aided and abetted ISIS
generally—there is no need for defendants to have aided and
abetted the specific Reina nightclub attack. Conversely, defendants
posit that they are liable only if they directly aided and abetted
the Reina nightclub attack, with a strict nexus between their
assistance and that attack. Neither side is quite right.

															To start, we find it unnecessary to parse
whether the textual object of “aids and abets” is
“the person” or the “act of international
terrorism.” That syntactic dispute makes little difference
here, because aiding and abetting is inherently a rule of secondary
liability for specific wrongful acts. See Prosser & Keeton 323.
As stated above, the rule imposes liability for a wrong on those
who “hel[p] another to complete its commission.”
Rosemond, 572 U. S., at 70 (emphasis added). Or, as
Halberstam put it, the defendant must aid and abet “a
tortious act.” 705 F. 2d, at 484.

															Nor would a contrary rule make sense for torts.
That is because tort law imposes liability only when someone
commits an actual tort; merely agreeing to commit a tort or
suggesting a tortious act is not, without more, tortious. See
Prosser & Keeton 324; Halberstam, 705 F. 2d, at
479.[11]
“Enterprises” or “conspiracies” alone are
therefore not tortious—the focus must remain on the tort
itself. The same is true here: The ATA opens the courthouse doors
only if the plaintiff is “injured . . . by reason
of an act of international terrorism.” §2333(a). JASTA
further restricts secondary liability by requiring that the
“act of international terrorism” be “committed,
planned, or authorized by” a foreign terrorist organization
designated as such “as of the date on which such act of
international terrorism was committed, planned, or
authorized.” §2333(d). Thus, it is not enough, as
plaintiffs contend, that a defendant have given substantial
assistance to a transcendent “enterprise” separate from
and floating above all the actionable wrongs that constitute it.
Rather, a defendant must have aided and abetted (by knowingly
providing substantial assistance) another person in the commission
of the actionable wrong—here, an act of international
terrorism. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts
§876(b), and Comment d; Halberstam, 705
F. 2d, at 488.

															Plaintiffs insist that Halberstam proves
the contrary, but their argument misses the gist of that case. To
be sure, Linda Hamilton was not on the scene for the burglary of
Halberstam’s house and did not lend any specific support to
Halberstam’s murder. Ibid. But Hamilton’s
assistance to Welch was so intentional and systematic that she
assisted each and every burglary committed by Welch; any time that
Welch left the house to burglarize, he would have relied on
Hamilton’s assistance in laundering the stolen goods and
transforming them into usable wealth. See ibid. Thus,
Hamilton did aid and abet Welch in burglarizing Halberstam’s
home—and, as noted above, killing Halberstam was a
foreseeable consequence of that burglary. See ibid.

															On the other hand, defendants overstate the
nexus that §2333(d)(2) requires between the alleged assistance
and the wrongful act. To start, aiding and abetting does not
require the defendant to have known “all particulars of the
primary actor’s plan.” Restatement (Third) of Torts:
Intentional Torts to Persons §10, Comment c, p. 104
(Tent. Draft No. 3, Apr. 6, 2018). For example, a defendant might
be held liable for aiding and abetting the burning of a building if
he intentionally helped others break into the building at night and
then, unknown to him, the others lit torches to guide them through
the dark and accidentally started a fire. See American Family
Mutual Ins. Co. v. Grim, 201 Kan. 340, 345–347,

440 P.2d 621, 625–626 (1968); Restatement (Second) of
Torts §876, Comment d, Illus. 10, at 318. That leads to
the next problem: As Halberstam makes clear, people who aid
and abet a tort can be held liable for other torts that were
“a foreseeable risk” of the intended tort. 705
F. 2d, at 488. Accordingly, a close nexus between the
assistance and the tort might help establish that the defendant
aided and abetted the tort, but even more remote support can still
constitute aiding and abetting in the right case.

															Moreover, in appropriate circumstances, a
secondary defendant’s role in an illicit enterprise can be so
systemic that the secondary defendant is aiding and abetting every
wrongful act committed by that enterprise—as in
Halberstam itself. Id., at 487–488. At this
point, aiding-and-abetting liability begins to blur with conspiracy
liability, which typically holds co-conspirators liable for all
reasonably foreseeable acts taken to further the conspiracy. See
Pinkerton v. United States, 328
U.S. 640, 647–648 (1946); see also Halberstam, 705
F. 2d, at 482–483 (noting the occasional overlap). Yet,
as noted above, aiding and abetting lacks the requisite agreement
that justifies such extensive conspiracy liability. See Restatement
(Second) of Torts §876, Comment a, at 316 (“The
theory of the early common law was that there was mutual agency of
each [conspirator] to act for the others”); Pinkerton,
328 U. S., at 646. Thus, while the facts of Halberstam
are not totemic (lest courts strain to compare Linda Hamilton with
international criminal syndicates), its facts are useful when
determining whether a defendant has so consciously
“participate[d] in” a series of tortious acts in order
to “make [each one] succeed.” Nye & Nissen,
336 U. S., at 619 (internal quotation marks omitted).

															*  *  *

															To summarize the requirements of
§2333(d)(2), the phrase “aids and abets, by knowingly
providing substantial assistance,” points to the elements and
factors articulated by Halberstam. But, those elements and
factors should not be taken as inflexible codes; rather, they
should be understood in light of the common law and applied as a
framework designed to hold defendants liable when they consciously
and culpably “participate[d] in” a tortious act in such
a way as to help “make it succeed.” Nye &
Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619 (internal quotation marks
omitted). And the text requires that defendants have aided and
abetted the act of international terrorism that injured the
plaintiffs—though that requirement does not always demand a
strict nexus between the alleged assistance and the terrorist
act.

															IV

															Under the appropriate framework, some aspects
of today’s case become immediately clear: First, because they
are trying to hold defendants liable for the Reina attack,
plaintiffs must plausibly allege that defendants aided and abetted
ISIS[12] in carrying out
that attack. Next, plaintiffs have satisfied
Halberstam’s first two elements by alleging both that
ISIS committed a wrong and that defendants knew they were playing
some sort of role in ISIS’ enterprise. The key question,
therefore, is whether defendants gave such knowing and substantial
assistance to ISIS that they culpably participated in the Reina
attack. The allegations here fall short of that showing under
Halberstam’s framework as properly understood by
reference to the common-law principles it applied.

															A

															To start, recall the basic ways that
defendants as a group allegedly helped ISIS. First, ISIS was active
on defendants’ social-media platforms, which are generally
available to the internet-using public with little to no front-end
screening by defendants. In other words, ISIS was able to upload
content to the platforms and connect with third parties, just like
everyone else. Second, defendants’ recommendation algorithms
matched ISIS-related content to users most likely to be interested
in that content—again, just like any other content. And,
third, defendants allegedly knew that ISIS was uploading this
content to such effect, but took insufficient steps to ensure that
ISIS supporters and ISIS-related content were removed from their
platforms. Notably, plaintiffs never allege that ISIS used
defendants’ platforms to plan or coordinate the Reina attack;
in fact, they do not allege that Masharipov himself ever used
Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter.

															None of those allegations suggest that
defendants culpably “associate[d themselves] with” the
Reina attack, “participate[d] in it as something that [they]
wishe[d] to bring about,” or sought “by [their] action
to make it succeed.” Nye & Nissen, 336 U. S.,
at 619 (internal quotation marks ommitted). In part, that is
because the only affirmative “conduct” defendants
allegedly undertook was creating their platforms and setting up
their algorithms to display content relevant to user inputs and
user history. Plaintiffs never allege that, after defendants
established their platforms, they gave ISIS any special treatment
or words of encouragement. Nor is there reason to think that
defendants selected or took any action at all with respect to
ISIS’ content (except, perhaps, blocking some of
it).[13] Indeed, there is
not even reason to think that defendants carefully screened any
content before allowing users to upload it onto their platforms. If
anything, the opposite is true: By plaintiffs’ own
allegations, these platforms appear to transmit most content
without inspecting it.

															The mere creation of those platforms, however,
is not culpable. To be sure, it might be that bad actors like ISIS
are able to use platforms like defendants’ for
illegal—and sometimes terrible—ends. But the same could
be said of cell phones, email, or the internet generally. Yet, we
generally do not think that internet or cell service providers
incur culpability merely for providing their services to the public
writ large. Nor do we think that such providers would normally be
described as aiding and abetting, for example, illegal drug deals
brokered over cell phones—even if the provider’s
conference-call or video-call features made the sale easier. See
Doe v. GTE Corp., 
347 F.3d 655, 659 (CA7 2003).

															To be sure, plaintiffs assert that
defendants’ “recommendation” algorithms go beyond
passive aid and constitute active, substantial assistance. We
disagree. By plaintiffs’ own telling, their claim is based on
defendants’ “provision of the infrastructure which
provides material support to ISIS.” App. 53. Viewed properly,
defendants’ “recommendation” algorithms are
merely part of that infrastructure. All the content on their
platforms is filtered through these algorithms, which allegedly
sort the content by information and inputs provided by users and
found in the content itself. As presented here, the algorithms
appear agnostic as to the nature of the content, matching any
content (including ISIS’ content) with any user who is more
likely to view that content. The fact that these algorithms matched
some ISIS content with some users thus does not convert
defendants’ passive assistance into active abetting. Once the
platform and sorting-tool algorithms were up and running,
defendants at most allegedly stood back and watched; they are not
alleged to have taken any further action with respect to ISIS.

															At bottom, then, the claim here rests less on
affirmative misconduct and more on an alleged failure to stop ISIS
from using these platforms. But, as noted above, both tort and
criminal law have long been leery of imposing aiding-and-abetting
liability for mere passive nonfeasance. To show that
defendants’ failure to stop ISIS from using these platforms
is somehow culpable with respect to the Reina attack, a strong
showing of assistance and scienter would thus be required.
Plaintiffs have not made that showing.

															First, the relationship between defendants and
the Reina attack is highly attenuated. As noted above,
defendants’ platforms are global in scale and allow hundreds
of millions (or billions) of people to upload vast quantities of
information on a daily basis. Yet, there are no allegations that
defendants treated ISIS any differently from anyone else. Rather,
defendants’ relationship with ISIS and its supporters appears
to have been the same as their relationship with their billion-plus
other users: arm’s length, passive, and largely indifferent.
Cf. Halberstam, 705 F. 2d, at 488. And their
relationship with the Reina attack is even further removed, given
the lack of allegations connecting the Reina attack with
ISIS’ use of these platforms.

															Second, because of the distance between
defendants’ acts (or failures to act) and the Reina attack,
plaintiffs would need some other very good reason to think that
defendants were consciously trying to help or otherwise
“participate in” the Reina attack. Nye &
Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619 (internal quotation marks
omitted). But they have offered no such reason, let alone a good
one. Again, plaintiffs point to no act of encouraging, soliciting,
or advising the commission of the Reina attack that would normally
support an aiding-and-abetting claim. See 2 LaFave §13.2(a),
at 457. Rather, they essentially portray defendants as bystanders,
watching passively as ISIS carried out its nefarious schemes. Such
allegations do not state a claim for culpable assistance or
participation in the Reina attack. See Halberstam, 705
F. 2d, at 481, 483.

															Because plaintiffs’ complaint rests so
heavily on defendants’ failure to act, their claims might
have more purchase if they could identify some independent duty in
tort that would have required defendants to remove ISIS’
content. See Woodward, 522 F. 2d, at 97, 100. But
plaintiffs identify no duty that would require defendants or other
communication-providing services to terminate customers after
discovering that the customers were using the service for illicit
ends. See Doe, 347 F. 3d, at 659; People v.
Brophy, 
49 Cal. App. 2d 15, 33–34 (1942).[14] To be sure, there may be situations where
some such duty exists, and we need not resolve the issue today.
Even if there were such a duty here, it would not transform
defendants’ distant inaction into knowing and substantial
assistance that could establish aiding and abetting the Reina
attack.

															If there were any doubt, the expansive scope of
plaintiffs’ claims would put it to rest. Given the lack of
any concrete nexus between defendants’ services and the Reina
attack, plaintiffs’ claims would necessarily hold defendants
liable as having aided and abetted each and every ISIS terrorist
act committed anywhere in the world. Under plaintiffs’
theory, any U. S. national victimized by an ISIS attack could
bring the same claim based on the same services allegedly provided
to ISIS. Plaintiffs thus must allege that defendants so
systemically and pervasively assisted ISIS that defendants could be
said to aid and abet every single ISIS attack. Viewed in that
light, the allegations here certainly fall short. Plaintiffs do not
claim that defendants intentionally associated themselves with
ISIS’ operations or affirmatively gave aid that would assist
each of ISIS’ terrorist acts. Nor have they alleged that
defendants and ISIS formed a near-common enterprise of the kind
that could establish such broad liability. These allegations are
thus a far cry from the type of pervasive, systemic, and culpable
assistance to a series of terrorist activities that could be
described as aiding and abetting each terrorist act.

															To be sure, we cannot rule out the possibility
that some set of allegations involving aid to a known terrorist
group would justify holding a secondary defendant liable for all of
the group’s actions or perhaps some definable subset of
terrorist acts. There may be, for example, situations where the
provider of routine services does so in an unusual way or provides
such dangerous wares that selling those goods to a terrorist group
could constitute aiding and abetting a foreseeable terror attack.
Cf. Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S.
703, 707, 711–712, 714–715 (1943) (registered
morphine distributor could be liable as a co- conspirator of an
illicit operation to which it mailed morphine far in excess of
normal amounts). Or, if a platform consciously and selectively
chose to promote content provided by a particular terrorist group,
perhaps it could be said to have culpably assisted the terrorist
group. Cf. Passaic Daily News v. Blair, 63 N. J.
474, 487–488, 
308 A.2d 649, 656 (1973) (publishing employment advertisements
that discriminate on the basis of sex could aid and abet the
discrimination).

															In those cases, the defendants would arguably
have offered aid that is more direct, active, and substantial than
what we review here; in such cases, plaintiffs might be able to
establish liability with a lesser showing of scienter. But we need
not consider every iteration on this theme. In this case, it is
enough that there is no allegation that the platforms here do more
than transmit information by billions of people, most of whom use
the platforms for interactions that once took place via mail, on
the phone, or in public areas. The fact that some bad actors took
advantage of these platforms is insufficient to state a claim that
defendants knowingly gave substantial assistance and thereby aided
and abetted those wrongdoers’ acts. And that is particularly
true because a contrary holding would effectively hold any sort of
communication provider liable for any sort of wrongdoing merely for
knowing that the wrongdoers were using its services and failing to
stop them. That conclusion would run roughshod over the typical
limits on tort liability and take aiding and abetting far beyond
its essential culpability moorings.

															B

															In holding that plaintiffs had stated a claim,
the Ninth Circuit went astray through a series of missteps that,
together, obscured the essence of aiding-and-abetting liability. To
correct those errors, we proceed through the Ninth Circuit’s
application of Halberstam’s framework.

															The Ninth Circuit framed the issue of
substantial assistance as turning on defendants’ assistance
to ISIS’ activities in general. See 2 F. 4th, at 909.
But, as we explained above, the question is whether defendants gave
substantial assistance to ISIS with respect to the Reina attack.
The focus thus must remain on the Reina attack; plaintiffs’
failure to allege any definable nexus between the defendants’
assistance and that attack therefore—at
minimum—drastically increases their burden to show that
defendants somehow consciously and culpably assisted the
attack.

															Next, the Ninth Circuit misapplied the
“knowing” half of “knowing and substantial
assistance.” It first separated the “knowing” and
“substantial” subelements; it then analyzed the
“knowing” subelement as a carbon copy of the antecedent
element of whether the defendants were “generally
aware” of their role in ISIS’ overall scheme.
Ibid.; see also id., at 908. But, as discussed above,
“the knowledge and substantial assistance” components
“should be considered relative to one another” as part
of a single inquiry designed to capture conscious and culpable
conduct. Camp, 948 F. 2d, at 459 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The “knowing” part of that inquiry is
therefore designed to capture the defendants’ state of mind
with respect to their actions and the tortious conduct (even if not
always the particular terrorist act), not the same general
awareness that defines Halberstam’s second
element.

															Finally, when applying Halberstam’s
six substantiality factors, the Ninth Circuit appears to have
regarded the factors as a sequence of disparate, unrelated
considerations without a common conceptual core. See 2 F. 4th,
at 909–910. That is incorrect. The point of those factors is
to help courts capture the essence of aiding and abetting:
participation in another’s wrongdoing that is both
significant and culpable enough to justify attributing the
principal wrongdoing to the aider and abettor. The Ninth Circuit
thus erred in focusing (as it did) primarily on the value of
defendants’ platforms to ISIS, rather than whether
defendants culpably associated themselves with ISIS’ actions.
For example, when applying the second factor (the amount and kind
of assistance), the Ninth Circuit should have considered that
defendants’ platforms and content-sorting algorithms were
generally available to the internet-using public. That focus
reveals that ISIS’ ability to benefit from these platforms
was merely incidental to defendants’ services and general
business models; it was not attributable to any culpable conduct of
defendants directed toward ISIS. And, when considering the fourth
and fifth factors (the defendants’ relationship to ISIS and
the defendants’ state of mind), the Ninth Circuit should have
given much greater weight to defendants’ arm’s-length
relationship with ISIS—which was essentially no different
from their relationship with their millions or billions of other
users—and their undisputed lack of intent to support ISIS.
See id., at 910.

															Taken as a whole, the Ninth Circuit’s
analytic approach thus elided the fundamental question of
aiding-and- abetting liability: Did defendants consciously,
voluntarily, and culpably participate in or support the relevant
wrongdoing? As we have explained above, the answer in this case is
no. Plaintiffs allege only that defendants supplied generally
available virtual platforms that ISIS made use of, and that
defendants failed to stop ISIS despite knowing it was using those
platforms. Given the lack of nexus between that assistance and the
Reina attack, the lack of any defendant intending to assist ISIS,
and the lack of any sort of affirmative and culpable misconduct
that would aid ISIS, plaintiffs’ claims fall far short of
plausibly alleging that defendants aided and abetted the Reina
attack.

															C

															That leaves the set of allegations specific to
Google. As explained above, plaintiffs allege that Google reviewed
and approved ISIS videos on YouTube as part of its revenue-sharing
system and thereby shared advertising revenue with ISIS. The Ninth
Circuit briefly mentioned those allegations when analyzing
plaintiffs’ complaint here. However, in addressing another,
materially identical complaint, the Ninth Circuit held that the
same allegations “failed to state a claim for
aiding-and-abetting liability” because they were
“devoid of any allegations about how much assistance Google
provided” and therefore did not plausibly allege “that
Google’s assistance was substantial.” Id., at
907.

															We think that the Ninth Circuit was correct in
that holding. The complaint here alleges nothing about the amount
of money that Google supposedly shared with ISIS, the number of
accounts approved for revenue sharing, or the content of the videos
that were approved. It thus could be the case that Google approved
only one ISIS-related video and shared only $50 with someone
affiliated with ISIS; the complaint simply does not say, nor does
it give any other reason to view Google’s revenue sharing as
substantial assistance. Without more, plaintiffs thus have not
plausibly alleged that Google knowingly provided substantial
assistance to the Reina attack, let alone (as their theory of
liability requires) every single terrorist act committed by
ISIS.

															V

															By their very nature, the concepts of aiding
and abetting and substantial assistance do not lend themselves to
crisp, bright-line distinctions. However, both the common law and
Halberstam provide some clear guideposts: The point of
aiding and abetting is to impose liability on those who consciously
and culpably participated in the tort at issue. The focus must
remain on assistance to the tort for which plaintiffs seek to
impose liability. When there is a direct nexus between the
defendant’s acts and the tort, courts may more easily infer
such culpable assistance. But, the more attenuated the nexus, the
more courts should demand that plaintiffs show culpable
participation through intentional aid that substantially furthered
the tort. And, if a plaintiff ’s theory would hold a
defendant liable for all the torts of an enterprise, then a showing
of pervasive and systemic aid is required to ensure that defendants
actually aided and abetted each tort of that enterprise.

															Here, however, the nexus between defendants and
the Reina attack is far removed. As alleged by plaintiffs,
defendants designed virtual platforms and knowingly failed to do
“enough” to remove ISIS-affiliated users and
ISIS-related content—out of hundreds of millions of users
worldwide and an immense ocean of content—from their
platforms. Yet, plaintiffs have failed to allege that defendants
intentionally provided any substantial aid to the Reina attack or
otherwise consciously participated in the Reina attack—much
less that defendants so pervasively and systemically assisted ISIS
as to render them liable for every ISIS attack. Plaintiffs
accordingly have failed to state a claim under
§2333(d)(2).

															We therefore reverse the judgment of the Ninth
Circuit.

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 In one form or another,
ISIS has been designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization since
2004; it has also been known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the
Levant, al Qaeda in Iraq, and the al-Zarqawi Network.
2
 Plaintiffs appear to
offer several theories as to the nature of their injury; because
that question is not before us, we take no position as to any of
those theories.
3
 Although Twitter, Inc.,
is the named petitioner and defendant, Twitter, Inc., has since
been merged into X Corp., a subsidiary of X Holdings Corp.
Similarly, although Facebook, Inc., and Google, Inc., are the named
defendants, Facebook, Inc., is now known as Meta Platforms, Inc.,
and Google, Inc., is now Google LLC, a subsidiary of Alphabet,
Inc.
4
 Plaintiffs also raised
other claims, including that defendants were directly liable for
having provided material support to ISIS. See, e.g., 18
U. S. C. §§2333(a), 2339A, 2339B, 2339C. The
District Court dismissed those claims as well, and plaintiffs did
not appeal them.
5
 The ATA defines
“international terrorism” to mean “activities
that— “(A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to
human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United
States or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation if
committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any
State; “(B) appear to be intended— “(i) to
intimidate or coerce a civilian population; “(ii) to
influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion;
or “(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass
destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and “(C) occur
primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United
States, or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by
which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to
intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators
operate or seek asylum.” §2331(1). In short, the act
generally must be violent, criminal, intended to in-timidate or
coerce civilians or a government, and occur either primarily
outside the United States or transcending national boundaries. See
ibid.
6
 The provision reads in
full: “The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia in Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472 (D.C.
Cir. 1983), which has been widely recognized as the leading case
regarding Federal civil aiding and abetting and conspiracy
liability, including by the Supreme Court of the United States,
provides the proper legal framework for how such liability should
function in the context of chapter 113B of title 18, United States
Code.” §2(a)(5), 130Stat. 852.
7
 Halberstam’s estate
also sued Welch himself; a default judgment was entered against
Welch, who did not appeal. See Halberstam, 705 F. 2d,
at 474.
8
 The D. C. Circuit
also held that Hamilton was liable as a co-conspirator. Id.,
at 489.
9
 Conversely, conspiracy
liability could be premised on a “more attenuated relation
with the principal violation” because the defendant and the
principal wrongdoer had agreed to a wrongful enterprise.
Halberstam, 705 F. 2d, at 485; see also Restatement
(Second) of Torts §876, Comment a, p. 316 (1979)
(“The theory of the early common law was that there was a
mutual agency of each to act for the others”).
10  Others, however, have wondered
whether any of these “elaborate discussions of the aiding and
abetting standard . . . ‘have added anything except
unnecessary detail’ ” to the formulation set forth
by Judge Learned Hand in United States v. Peoni, 100
F.2d 401 (CA2 1938), and adopted by this Court in Nye &
Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S.
613 (1949). SEC v. Apuzzo, 689 F.3d 204, 212,
n. 9 (CA2 2012) (quoting IIT, an Int’l Inv. Trust
v. Cornfeld, 619 F.2d 909, 922 (CA2 1980)).
11  In
this respect, tort law is different from criminal law, which
does punish mere agreements to commit crimes. See,
e.g., 2 LaFave §12.2(b), at 372 (“At common law a
conspiracy was punishable even though no act was done beyond the
mere making of the agreement”); see also 1 J. Ohlin,
Wharton’s Criminal Law §8.7, p. 242 (16th ed. 2021)
(noting that statutory requirements of an “overt act”
generally do not require that the overt act be criminal);
Iannelli v. United States, 420
U.S. 770, 785, n. 17 (1975) (similar).
12  For
purposes of this case, we need not resolve whether defendants must
have aided and abetted ISIS, Masharipov, or some subgroup of ISIS
operatives in committing the Reina attack. In other words, we need
not resolve whether “the person” referred to in
§2333(d)(2) encompasses international terrorist syndicates or
is somehow otherwise limited; either way, defendants need to have
aided and abetted that “person” in carrying out the
Reina attack.
13  Plaintiffs concede that defendants
attempted to remove at least some ISIS-sponsored accounts and
content after they were brought to their attention.
14  Plaintiffs have not presented any
case holding such a company liable for merely failing to block such
criminals despite knowing that they used the company’s
services. Rather, when legislatures have wanted to impose a duty to
remove content on these types of entities, they have apparently
done so by statute. See, e.g., Telecommunications Act of
1996, §502, 110Stat. 133–134 (codified, as amended, at
47 U. S. C. §223); but see Reno v.
American Civil Liberties Union, 521
U.S. 844, 857, 874 (1997) (holding parts of §223
unconstitutional under the First Amendment).
