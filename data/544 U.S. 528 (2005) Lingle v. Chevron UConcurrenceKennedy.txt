SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 04-163

															LINDA LINGLE, GOVERNOR OF HAWAII, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. CHEVRON U. S. A. INC.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 23, 2005]

															   Justice Kennedy, concurring.

															   This separate writing is to note
that today’s decision does not foreclose the possibility that
a regulation might be so arbitrary or irrational as to violate due
process. Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U. S. 498, 539
(1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in
part). The failure of a regulation to accomplish a stated or
obvious objective would be relevant to that inquiry. Chevron
voluntarily dismissed its due process claim without prejudice,
however, and we have no occasion to consider whether Act 257 of the
1997 Hawaii Session Laws “represents one of the rare
instances in which even such a permissive standard has been
violated.” Apfel, supra, at 550. With these
observations, I join the opinion of the Court.
