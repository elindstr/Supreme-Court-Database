															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															EDWARD R. LANE, PETITIONER v. STEVE FRANKS, in
his individual capacity, and SUSAN BURROW, in her official capacity
as ACTING PRESIDENT OF CENTRALALABAMA COMMUNITYCOLLEGE

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

															[June 19, 2014]

															

															     Justice Thomas, with
whom Justice Scalia and Justice Alito join, concurring.

															     This case presents the
discrete question whether a public employee speaks “as a
citizen on a matter of public concern,” Garcetti v. Ceballos,
547 U. S. 410, 418 (2006) , when the employee gives
“[t]ruthful testimony under oath . . . outside the scope of
his ordinary job duties,” ante, at 9. Answering that question
requires little more than a straightforward application of
Garcetti. There, we held that when a public employee speaks
“pursuant to” his official duties, he is not speaking
“as a citizen,” and First Amendment protection is
unavailable. 547 U. S., at 421–422. The petitioner in
this case did not speak “pursuant to” his ordinary job
duties because his responsibilities did not include testifying in
court proceedings, see ante, at 8, n. 4, and no party has suggested
that he was subpoenaed as a representative of his employer, see
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 30(b)(6) (requiring subpoenaed organizations
to designate witnesses to testify on their behalf). Because
petitioner did not testify to “fulfil[l] a [work]
responsibility,” Garcetti, supra, at 421, he spoke “as
a citizen,” not as an employee.

															     We accordingly have no
occasion to address the quite different question whether a public
employee speaks “as a citizen” when he testifies in the
course of his ordinary job responsibilities. See ante, at 8,
n. 4. For some public employees—such as police officers,
crime scene technicians, and laboratory analysts—testifying
is a routine and critical part of their employment duties. Others
may be called to testify in the context of particular litigation as
the designated representatives of their employers. See Fed. Rule
Civ. Proc. 30(b)(6). The Court properly leaves the constitutional
questions raised by these scenarios for another day.
