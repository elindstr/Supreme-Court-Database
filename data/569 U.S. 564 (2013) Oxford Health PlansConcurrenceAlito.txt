															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 12–135

															_________________

															OXFORD HEALTH PLANS LLC, PETITIONER v.
JOHN IVAN SUTTER

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the third circuit

															[June 10, 2013]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring.

															As the Court explains, “[c]lass
arbitration is a matter of consent,” ante, at 1, and
petitioner consented to the arbitrator’s authority by
conceding that he should decide in the first instance whether the
contract authorizes class arbitration. The Court accordingly
refuses to set aside the arbitrator’s ruling because he was
“ ‘arguably construing . . . the
contract’ ” when he allowed respondent to proceed
on a classwide basis. Ante, at 8 (quoting Eastern
Associated Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers, 531 U.S.
57, 62 (2000)). Today’s result follows directly from
petitioner’s concession and the narrow judicial review that
federal law allows in arbitration cases. See 9 U. S. C.
§10(a).

															But unlike petitioner, absent members of the
plaintiff class never conceded that the contract authorizes the ar-
bitrator to decide whether to conduct class arbitration. It
doesn’t. If we were reviewing the arbitrator’s
interpretation of the contract de novo, we would have
little trouble concluding that he improperly inferred “[a]n
implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitration
. . . from the fact of the parties’ agreement to
arbitrate.” Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds
Int’l Corp., 559 U.S.
662, 685 (2010).

															With no reason to think that the absent class
members ever agreed to class arbitration, it is far from clear that
they will be bound by the arbitrator’s ultimate resolution of
this dispute. Arbitration “is a matter of consent, not
coercion,” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board
of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S.
468, 479 (1989), and the absent members of the plaintiff class
have not submitted themselves to this arbitrator’s authority
in any way. It is true that they signed contracts with arbitration
clauses materially identical to those signed by the plaintiff who
brought this suit. But an arbitrator’s erroneous
interpretation of contracts that do not authorize class arbitration
cannot bind someone who has not authorized the arbitrator to make
that determination. As the Court explains, “[a]n arbitrator
may employ class procedures only if the parties have authorized
them.” Ante, at 1.

															The distribution of opt-out notices does not
cure this fundamental flaw in the class arbitration proceeding in
this case. “[A]rbitration is simply a matter of contract
between the parties,” First Options of Chicago,
Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S.
938, 943 (1995), and an offeree’s silence does not
normally modify the terms of a contract, 1 Restatement (Second) of
Contracts §69(1) (1979). Accord- ingly, at least where absent
class members have not been required to opt in, it is
difficult to see how an arbitrator’s decision to conduct
class proceedings could bind absent class members who have not
authorized the arbitrator to decide on a classwide basis which
arbitration procedures are to be used.

															Class arbitrations that are vulnerable to
collateral at- tack allow absent class members to unfairly claim
the “benefit from a favorable judgment without subjecting
themselves to the binding effect of an unfavorable one,”
American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S.
538, 546–547 (1974). In the absence of concessions like
Oxford’s, this possibility should give courts pause before
concluding that the availability of class arbitration is a question
the arbitrator should decide. But because that argument was not
available to petitioner in light of its concession below, I join
the opinion of the Court.
