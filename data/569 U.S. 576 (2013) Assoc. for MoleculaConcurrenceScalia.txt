															ASSOCIATION FOR MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY,
et al., PETITIONERS v. MYRIAD GENETICS, INC.,

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[June 13, 2013]

															

															Justice Scalia, concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment.

															I join the judgment of the Court, and all of its
opinion except Part I–A and some portions of the rest of the
opinion going into fine details of molecular biology. I am un- able
to affirm those details on my own knowledge or even my own belief.
It suffices for me to affirm, having studied the opinions below and
the expert briefs presented here, that the portion of DNA isolated
from its natural state sought to be patented is identical to that
portion of the DNA in its natural state; and that complementary DNA
(cDNA) is a synthetic creation not normally present in nature.
