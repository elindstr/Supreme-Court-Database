															To this bill defendants interposed a plea setting up the various steps by which the defendant Groeck obtained the patent of the land as a qualified preemptor, and thereby, as alleged, obtained a legal and perfect title in fee simple, and further setting up the defense of laches to the claim of the railroad company.

															The circuit court entered an order sustaining the plea upon the ground of laches, with leave to the company to reply to the plea and take issue as to the matters of fact therein alleged.  74 F. 585.  The company having declined to avail itself of this privilege, the circuit court ordered the bill to be dismissed.  Whereupon the railroad company appealed to the circuit court of appeals, which reversed the decree of the circuit court, and remanded the case for further proceedings.  87 F. 970.  The case coming on again for hearing, a decree was rendered for the plaintiff, another appeal taken to the court of appeals, and the decree of the circuit court affirmed.

															MR. JUSTICE BROWN delivered the opinion of the Court.

															This case resembles the one just decided in all its essential particulars, and is controlled by it.

															The decrees of both courts are therefore

															Reversed, and the case remanded to the Circuit Court for the Southern District of California with directions to dismiss the bill.
