SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 07-219





															EXXON SHIPPING COMPANY, et al., PETITIONERS v.
GRANT BAKER et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 25, 2008]



															   Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring.

															
   I join the opinion of the Court, including the portions that refer to constitutional limits that prior opinions have imposed upon punitive damages.  While I agree with the argumentation based upon those prior holdings, I continue to believe the holdings were in error.  See State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U. S. 408, 429 (2003) (Scalia, J., dissenting).
