U.S. Supreme CourtJenness v. Citizens' National Bank of Rome, 110 U.S. 52 (1884)
Jenness v. Citizens' National Bank of Rome
Submitted December 20, 1883
Decided January 7, 1884
110 U.S. 52

IN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR THE

															EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN
Syllabus 

															When a judgment below is for an amount sufficient to give jurisdiction above, but it appears affirmatively on the record that after deducting from it an amount not in contest below, there remains less than the jurisdictional sum, this Court has no jurisdiction.

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court

															The judgment in this case is for $7,275.16, but it appears 
															Page 110 U. S. 53
															 affirmatively on the face of the record that of this amount $2,669.03 was not disputed below.  The defense related alone to the difference between these two amounts, which is less than $5,000.  The dispute here is only in reference to the amount contested below.  Such being the case, we have no jurisdiction.  The case of Gray v. Blanchard, 97 U. S. 564; Tintsman v. National Bank, 100 U. S. 6, and Hilton v. Dickinson, 108 U. S. 165, are conclusive to this effect.

															Dismissed.
