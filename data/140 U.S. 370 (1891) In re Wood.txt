APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
Concurring opinion of MR. JUSTICE FIELD

															MR. JUSTICE FIELD, concurring.

															I concur in the judgment in this case, but not in all the views expressed in the opinion.  I adhere to what I said in my dissent in the case of Neal v. Delaware, 103 U. S. 405,  103 U. S. 409, that there is nothing in the late amendments to the Constitution, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, which requires that colored citizens shall be summoned on juries,

															 grand or petit, in order to secure to persons of their race justice and equality in the administration of the law, and further that the manner in which jurors serve in the state courts shall be selected and the qualifications they shall possess are matters entirely of state regulation.
