															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 13–298

															ALICE CORPORATION PTY. LTD, PETITIONER v. CLS
BANK INTERNATIONAL et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[June 19, 2014]

															

															     Justice Sotomayor,
with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, concurring.

															     I adhere to the view
that any “claim that merely describes a method of doing
business does not qualify as a ‘process’ under
§101.” Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U. S. 593, 614 (2010)
(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); see also In re Bilski,
545 F. 3d 943, 972 (CA Fed. 2008) (Dyk, J., concurring)
(“There is no suggestion in any of th[e] early [English]
consideration of process patents that processes for organizing
human activity were or ever had been patent- able”). As in
Bilski, however, I further believe that the method claims at issue
are drawn to an abstract idea. Cf. 561 U. S., at 619 (opinion
of Stevens, J.). I therefore join the opinion of the Court.
