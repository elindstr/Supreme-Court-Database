															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 19–968

															_________________

															CHIKE UZUEGBUNAM, et al., PETITIONERS v. STANLEY C. PRECZEWSKI, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

															[March 8, 2021]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															I agree with the Court that, as a matter of history and precedent, a plaintiff’s request for nominal damages can satisfy the redressability requirement for Article III standing and can keep an otherwise moot case alive.  I write separately simply to note that I agree with The Chief Justice and the Solicitor General that a defendant should be able to accept the entry of a judgment for nominal damages against it and thereby end the litigation without a resolution of the merits.  Post, at 11 (Roberts, C. J., dissenting); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29–30.
