															HEALTH AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION OF MARION
COUNTY, et al., PETITIONERS v. IVANKA TALEVSKI, as
personal representative of the ESTATE OF GORGI TALEVSKI,
DECEASED

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 8, 2023]

															Justice Jackson delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															The Federal Nursing Home Reform Act (FNHRA or
Act) ensures that nursing homes that receive Medicaid funding
respect and protect their residents’ health, safety, and
dignity. Provisions of the FNHRA refer to rights of nursing-home
residents to be free from unnecessary physical or chemical
restraints and to be discharged or transferred only when certain
preconditions are satisfied. This case is about these particular
provisions and whether nursing-home residents can seek to vindicate
those FNHRA rights in court.

															Respondent Ivanka Talevski maintains that she
can enforce the rights these particular FNHRA provisions describe
via 42 U. S. C. §1983, which, since the 1870s, has
provided an express cause of action to any person deprived (by
someone acting under color of state law) of “any rights
. . . secured by the Constitution and laws.”
Petitioners insist that respondent is wrong about being able to
rely on §1983 in this context, for two independent reasons.
First, petitioners urge us to discard our longstanding recognition
that

															§1983’s unqualified reference to
“laws” “means what it says,” Maine
v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S.
1, 4 (1980), and to rule instead that §1983 contains an
implicit carveout for laws that Congress enacts via its spending
power—a holding that, according to petitioners, would mean
that §1983 could not be used to enforce any rights the FNHRA
purports to recognize. In the alternative, petitioners point to our
established methods for determining whether a statutory provision
creates a §1983-enforceable right and maintain that these
FNHRA provisions do not create rights that nursing-home residents
can enforce via §1983.

															We reject both propositions. “Laws”
means “laws,” no less today than in the 1870s, and
nothing in petitioners’ appeal to Reconstruction-era contract
law shows otherwise. Consequently, as we have previously held,
§1983 can presumptively be used to enforce unambiguously
conferred federal individual rights, unless a private right of
action under §1983 would thwart any enforcement mechanism that
the rights-creating statute contains for protection of the rights
it has created. Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School
Comm., 555 U.S.
246, 253–255 (2009); Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe,
536
U.S. 273, 284, and n. 4 (2002). We hold that the two FNHRA
provisions at issue here do unambiguously create
§1983-enforceable rights. And we discern no incompatibility
between private enforcement under §1983 and the statutory
scheme that Congress has devised for the protection of those
rights. Accordingly, we affirm the lower court’s judgment
that respondent’s §1983 action can proceed in court.

															I

															In 2016, when Gorgi Talevski’s dementia
progressed to the point that his family members could no longer
care for him, they placed him in petitioner Valparaiso Care and
Rehabilitation’s (VCR) nursing home.[1] When he entered VCR, Mr. Talevski could talk, feed
himself, walk, socialize, and recognize his family. Later in 2016,
however, Mr. Talevski’s condition suddenly deteriorated. He
became unable to eat on his own and began losing the ability to
communicate in English (leaving him to rely primarily on
Macedonian, his native language).

															VCR staff claimed this was dementia’s
natural progression. But Mr. Talevski’s daughter suspected,
and then confirmed with outside physicians, that VCR was chemically
restraining Mr. Talevski with six powerful psychotropic
medications. With the help of an outside neurologist, his
medication was tapered down, and he began to regain the ability to
feed himself. Around this time, the Indiana State Department of
Health (Department) conducted its periodic inspection of VCR, and
the Talevskis filed a formal complaint with the inspectors
regarding the chemical restraints.

															The problems did not end there. Toward the end
of 2016, VCR began asserting that Mr. Talevski was harassing female
residents and staff. Based on that claim, VCR began sending Mr.
Talevski to a psychiatric hospital 90 minutes away for several days
at a time. VCR readmitted Mr. Talevski the first two times it sent
him away. But the third time, instead of accepting him back, VCR
tried to force his permanent transfer to a dementia facility in
Indianapolis. It executed these changed circumstances without first
notifying Mr. Talevski or his family.

															The Talevskis filed a complaint with the
Department regarding Mr. Talevski’s forced transfer. While
the complaint was pending, Mr. Talevski had to stay at another
facility that was 90 minutes away from his family. Eventually, a
Department administrative law judge nullified VCR’s attempted
transfer of Mr. Talevski. Based on that determination, the
Talevskis endeavored to have Mr. Talevski returned to VCR. But VCR
ignored the judge’s decision and refused readmission.

															The Talevskis complained again to the
Department, which later issued a report regarding the
Talevskis’ complaints. Subsequently, petitioner American
Senior Communities LLC (ASC), which manages VCR, contacted Mr.
Talevski’s wife, Ivanka, to discuss the possibility of Mr.
Talevski’s return. At this point, however, Mr. Talevski had
acclimated to his new home, and the Talevskis feared retribution
against him if he returned to VCR. So they opted to leave him in
the new facility, which meant that every family visit required a
3-hour round trip.

															In 2019, Mr. Talevski (through Ivanka) sued VCR,
ASC, and petitioner Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion
County (collectively, HHC) under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42
U. S. C. §1983.[2] The lawsuit claimed that HHC’s treatment of Mr.
Talevski—in particular, the use of chemical restraints and
the persistent transfer attempts—had violated rights that the
FNHRA guaranteed him as a nursing-home resident. The District Court
granted HHC’s subsequent motion to dismiss the complaint,
reasoning that no plaintiff can enforce provisions of the FNHRA via
§1983.

															The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
reversed. It concluded that, under this Court’s precedent,
the relevant FNHRA provisions “unambiguously confer
individually enforceable rights on nursing-home residents,”
making those rights presumptively enforceable via §1983. 6 F.
4th 713, 720 (2021). The Court of Appeals held further that the
presumption had not been rebutted here, because nothing in the
FNHRA indicated congressional intent to foreclose §1983
enforcement of these rights. Id., at 720–721.

															HHC filed a petition for certiorari, which we
granted.[3] 596 U. S. ___
(2022). For the reasons explained below, we affirm the Seventh
Circuit’s judgment.

															II

															A

															As relevant here, §1983 provides that

															“[e]very person who, under color of
any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State
or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be
subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within
the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,
privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,
shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in
equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.”

															That is, any person within the jurisdiction of
the United States may invoke this cause of action against any other
person who, acting “under color of ” state law,
has deprived them of “any rights, privileges, or immunities
secured by the Constitution and laws” of the United
States.

															We have been asked before to narrow the scope of
this express authorization, i.e., to read “laws”
to mean only “civil rights or equal protection laws.”
Thiboutot, 448 U. S., at 6. We declined to do so,
reasoning that a straightforward reading of the “plain
language” of §1983 is required. Id., at 4. That
should have been no surprise; “Congress attached no modifiers
to the phrase [‘and laws’].” Ibid.

															Since Thiboutot, we have crafted a test
for determining whether a particular federal law actually secures
rights for §1983 purposes. See Gonzaga, 536 U. S.,
at 283–285; Part III–B, infra. But we have not
previously doubted that any federal law can do so.

															1

															HHC attempts to sow renewed doubt about
§1983’s textually unqualified sweep by proffering
“historical evidence.” Brief for Petitioners 3; see
also id., at 2 (asserting that “[f]or most of this
nation’s history, individuals did not have a recognized
private right to enforce obligations prescribed by federal
statutes”). As background for our evaluation of the
particulars of HHC’s Spending Clause-based argument regarding
§1983’s meaning, see Part II–B–2,
infra, a fuller picture of the relevant historical context
is warranted. United States v. Union Pacific R. Co.,
91 U.S.
72, 79 (1875); accord, Towne v. Eisner, 245 U.S.
418, 425 (1918) (Holmes, J., for the Court).

															Before the Civil War, few direct federal
protections for individual rights against state infringements
existed. The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments
worked a sea change in this regard. See McDonald v.
Chicago, 561 U.S.
742, 754 (2010); Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S.
445, 453–456 (1976); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S.
339, 344–345 (1880). Still, neither these Civil War
Amendments nor the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1866 successfully
prevented postbellum state actors from continuing to deprive
American citizens of federally protected rights. Mitchum v.
Foster, 407 U.S.
225, 240 (1972).

															In early 1871, a Senate Select Committee
produced and distributed a Report that ran hundreds of pages and
recounted pervasive state-sanctioned lawlessness and violence
against the freedmen and their White Republican allies.
Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S.
167, 174 (1961) (citing S. Rep. No. 1, 42d Cong., 1st. Sess.
(1871)).[4] After reading the
Report, President Ulysses S. Grant implored Congress to
act.

															It is against this backdrop that the 42d
Congress enacted, and President Grant signed, the Civil Rights Act
of 1871. The first section of that statute, as reenacted in 1874,
created the federal cause of action now codified as §1983.
Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization,
441 U.S.
600, 608, and n. 16 (1979) (citing Rev. Stat. §1979
(1874)). The “plain language[’s]” lack of
“modifiers,” Thiboutot, 448 U. S., at 4,
reflected the regrettable reality that “state
instrumentalities” could not, or would not, fully protect
federal rights, Mitchum, 407 U. S., at 242.

															We have adhered to this understanding of
§1983’s operation. To guarantee the protection of
federal rights, “the §1983 remedy . . . is, in
all events, supplementary to any remedy any State might
have.” Owens v. Okure, 488
U.S. 235, 248 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted);
Knick v. Township of Scott, 588 U. S. ___, ___
(2019) (slip op., at 11). And we have consistently refused to read
§1983’s “plain language” to mean anything
other than what it says. Thiboutot, 448 U. S., at
4–6 (observing that our cases, running back to at least 1968,
only make sense if “laws” indeed means
“laws”).

															2

															We are not persuaded by HHC’s argument
(which Justice Thomas supports, see post, at 1, 35
(dissenting opinion)), that Talevski cannot invoke §1983 to
vindicate the rights the FNHRA provisions at issue here purport to
recognize because Congress seems to have enacted the FNHRA pursuant
to the spending power recognized in Article I, §8, of the
Constitution.[5]

															HHC’s argument generally proceeds as
follows. Starting with our precedent regarding Congress’s
spending power,  HHC begins by emphasizing our observation
that federal legislation premised on that power is “much in
the nature of a contract,” because, “in return for
federal funds, the States agree to comply with federally imposed
conditions.” Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.
Halderman, 451 U.S.
1, 17 (1981); see also Cummings v. Premier Rehab
Keller, 596 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 4). HHC
then seizes on the “contract” analogy to create a
syllogism. It reasons that (1) any private party suing to enforce
an obligation between Federal and State Governments that a Spending
Clause statute creates is, essentially, a “third-party
beneficiary” (by which HHC means beneficiaries of rights
created in any such statute); and (2) under common-law contract
principles extant at the time that Congress enacted §1983,
third-party beneficiaries were “generally” barred from
suing to enforce contract obligations; therefore, (3) plaintiffs
like Talevski, as a purported third-party beneficiary of the FNHRA,
may not use §1983 to do something that third-party
beneficiaries of contracts generally could not do in the 1870s.
Brief for Petitioners 13, 17–18 (citing 1870s treatises and
state cases).

															The upshot, for HHC, is that “Spending
Clause statutes do not give rise to privately enforceable rights
under Section 1983” because contracts were not
“generally” enforceable by third-party beneficiaries at
common law. Id., at 11, 13. On this basis alone, HHC thus,
in effect, urges us to reject decades of precedent, and to rewrite
§1983’s plain text to read “laws (unless those
laws rest on the Spending Power).”

															Two well-established principles, applied here,
suffice to reject HHC’s invitation to reimagine
Congress’s handiwork (and our precedent interpreting it).

															First, our prior §1983 cases reference
“ ‘firmly rooted’ ” common-law
principles. Wyatt v. Cole, 504
U.S. 158, 164 (1992). We implement Congress’s choices
rather than remake them. Azar v. Allina Health
Services, 587 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2019) (slip op.,
at 14–15). Thus, we have reasoned that Congress’s
failure to displace firmly rooted common-law principles
generally indicates that it incorporated those established
principles into §1983. Wyatt, 504 U. S., at
163–164.[6] Here,
HHC’s key common-law plank—that third-party
beneficiaries could not sue to enforce contractual obligations
during the relevant time—is, at a minimum, contestable. See
Brief for Contract Law Professors et al. as Amici
Curiae 4 (“[A] majority of American jurisdictions
. . . permit[ted] third-party beneficiaries to sue
through at least the early 1870s”); see also Hendrick
v. Lindsay, 93 U.S.
143, 149 (1876) (concluding that “the right of a party to
maintain assumpsit on a promise not under seal, made to another for
his benefit, . . . is now the prevailing rule in this
country”).[7]
“[S]omething more than ‘ambiguous historical
evidence’ is required before we will ‘flatly overrule a
number of major decisions of this Court,’ ”
Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___
(2019) (slip op., at 11), as HHC essentially asks us to do
here.

															Second, because “[t]here is no doubt that
the cause of action created by §1983 is, and was always
regarded as, a tort claim,” Monterey v. Del Monte
Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S.
687, 727 (1999) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment), HHC’s particular focus on 1870s law governing
third-party-beneficiary suits in contract is, at the very least,
perplexing. If there is a reason that the principles governing
those suits should be read to displace the plain scope of
§1983’s “ ‘species of tort
liability,’ ” Heck v. Humphrey,
512 U.S.
477, 483 (1994), HHC has utterly failed to identify it.

															We have no doubt that HHC wishes §1983 said
something else. But that is “an appeal better directed to
Congress.” Nieves v. Bartlett, 587 U. S.
___, ___ (2019) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part) (slip op., at 2). Hewing to §1983’s text and
history (not to mention our precedent and constitutional role), we
reject HHC’s request, and reaffirm that “laws” in
§1983 means what it says. Thiboutot, 448 U. S., at
4.[8]

															III

															The FNHRA can create
§1983-enforceable rights. But do the two FNHRA provisions at
issue in this case actually do so? In that respect, our precedent
sets a demanding bar: Statutory provisions must
unambiguously confer individual federal rights.
Gonzaga, 536 U. S., at 280. For the reasons explained
below, we conclude that the bar has been cleared with respect to
the presently contested provisions. And while the FNHRA itself
might nevertheless evince Congress’s intent to preclude the
use of §1983 to enforce these particular rights, id.,
at 284, n. 4, we hold further that it does not.

															A

															The FNHRA provisions at issue in this case,
like the rest of the Act, stem from a longstanding national
commitment to provide safe and dignified care for the elderly.
Since as early as the Social Security Act of 1935, federal law has
aimed in myriad ways to promote nursing homes that provide quality
services. Yet, concerns about the poor condition of such facilities
persisted even after Congress enacted the 1965 Medicare and
Medicaid Acts,[9] partly due to
widespread noncompliance with existing federal and state laws. See
Institute of Medicine, Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing
Homes 2–3, 11, 241–246 (1986); H. R. Rep. No.
100–391, pt. 1, pp. 448–452 (1987). Thus, in 1987,
Congress passed, and President Ronald Reagan signed, the FNHRA,
effecting a “seismic shift” in nursing-home quality
standards. B. Furrow, T. Greaney, S. Johnson, T. Jost, & R.
Schwartz, Health Law 51 (3d ed. 2015) (Health Law).[10] The FNHRA is largely composed of a
litany of statutory requirements that Congress laid out for
Medicaid-participant States and “nursing facilities.”
§1396a(a)(28).[11]
Those include “[r]equirements relating to residents’
rights,” §1396r(c) (boldface deleted), two of which
Talevski’s complaint invoked.

															The first requires nursing facilities to
“protect and promote” residents’ “right to
be free from . . . any physical or chemical restraints
imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required
to treat the resident’s medical symptoms.”
§1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (referred to herein as “the
unnecessary-restraint provision”). The second appears in a
subparagraph concerning “E.g.,
§§1396r(c)(2)(A)–(B) (referred to herein as
“the predischarge-notice provision”).

															As for enforcement, like other aspects of
Medicaid, the FNHRA anticipates “cooperative
federalism”—i.e., federal and state actors
working together—to carry out the statute’s aims.
Wisconsin Dept. of Health and Family Servs. v.
Blumer, 534 U.S.
473, 495 (2002). Thus, qualifying State Medicaid plans, which
are approved by the Secretary of the U. S. Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS Secretary), §1396a(b), must
include provisions that relate to nursing facilities, and must
require “any nursing facility receiving payments under”
the plan to satisfy certain FNHRA mandates. §1396a(a)(28). The
HHS Secretary must also “assure that” approved state
plans—and “the enforcement of [plan]
requirements”—are, inter alia,
“adequate” to “protect the health, safety,
welfare, and rights of [nursing-home] residents.”
§1396r(f )(1).

															The FNHRA also establishes a detailed
administrative scheme for government inspections of nursing
facilities. §1396r(g). “Surveys” (in the
statute’s parlance) must be conducted to detect nursing homes
that are falling short of the FNHRA’s minimum standards, and
state and federal officials must periodically file certifications,
based on these surveys, regarding nursing-home compliance, see
§1396r(g)(1)(A). In addition, the statute authorizes
government actors to sanction and correct noncompliant facilities,
or, if appropriate, exclude them from the Medicaid program
entirely. §1396r(h); see also Health Law 56–63.

															B

															1

															Although federal statutes have the potential
to create §1983-enforceable rights, they do not do so as a
matter of course. For Spending Clause legislation in particular, we
have recognized that “ ‘the typical remedy for
state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a
private cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the
Federal Government to terminate funds to the
State.’ ” Gonzaga, 536 U. S., at 280
(quoting Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 28). The parties here
thus dispute whether this is the atypical case; that is, whether
the unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice provisions of the
FNHRA “unambiguously confe[r]” individual rights,
making those rights “presumptively enforceable” under
§1983. 536 U. S., at 283–284.

															Gonzaga sets forth our established method
for ascertaining unambiguous conferral. Courts must employ
traditional tools of statutory construction to assess whether
Congress has “unambiguously conferred”
“individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries” to
which the plaintiff belongs. Id., at 283, 285–286; see
also Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544
U.S. 113, 120 (2005). Notably, it must be determined that
“Congress intended to create a federal right”
for the identified class, not merely that the plaintiffs
fall “within the general zone of interest that the statute is
intended to protect.” Gonzaga, 536 U. S., at 283
(emphasis deleted). This paradigm respects Congress’s primacy
in this arena and thus vindicates the separation of powers.
Id., at 286.

															We have held that the Gonzaga test is
satisfied where the provision in question is
“ ‘phrased in terms of the persons
benefited’ ” and contains
“rights-creating,” individual-centric language with an
“ ‘unmistakable focus on the benefited
class.’ ” Id., at 284, 287 (emphasis
deleted). Conversely, we have rejected §1983 enforceability
where the statutory provision “contain[ed] no rights-creating
language”; had “an aggregate, not individual,
focus”; and “serve[d] primarily to direct the [Federal
Government’s] distribution of public funds.”
Id., at 290.

															If a statutory provision surmounts this
significant hurdle, it “secure[s]”
§1983-enforceable rights, consistent with §1983’s
text. And because “§1983 generally supplies a remedy for
the vindication of rights secured by federal statutes,”
rights so secured are deemed “presumptively
enforceable” under §1983. Gonzaga, 536
U. S., at 284.

															2

															The unnecessary-restraint and
predischarge-notice provisions meet this test. To start, we note
that both reside in 42 U. S. C. §1396r(c), which
expressly concerns “[r]equirements relating to
residents’ rights.” Ibid. (emphasis added;
boldface deleted); see also West Virginia v. EPA, 597
U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 16) (statutory provisions
“ ‘must be read in their context and with a view
to their place in the overall statutory
scheme’ ”). This framing is indicative of an
individual “rights-creating” focus. Gonzaga, 536
U. S., at 284. Examined further, the text of the unnecessary-
restraint and predischarge-notice provisions unambiguously confers
rights upon the residents of nursing-home facilities.

															The unnecessary-restraint provision requires
nursing homes to “protect and promote . . .
[t]he right to be free from . . . any physical or
chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or
convenience and not required to treat the resident’s
medical symptoms.” §1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).
The provision’s enumerated exceptions further sustain the
focus on individual residents. For example, nursing homes may use
restraints “to ensure the physical safety of the resident
or other residents,” but “only upon the written
order of a physician that specifies the duration and circumstances
under which the restraints are to be used” (absent emergency
circumstances specified by the HHS Secretary).
§§1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii)(I)–(II) (emphasis added).

															The predischarge-notice provision is more of the
same. Nestled in a paragraph concerning “transfer and
discharge rights,” §1396r(c)(2) (emphasis added;
boldface deleted), that provision tells nursing facilities that
they “must not transfer or discharge [a]
resident” unless certain preconditions are met,
including advance notice of the transfer or discharge to the
resident and his or her family.
§§1396r(c)(2)(A)–(B) (emphasis added). And, again,
the statute’s caveats remain focused on individual residents:
A nursing home may transfer or discharge such an individual if,
among other things, the transfer is “necessary to meet the
resident’s welfare”; or if the resident’s
health has improved so much that the facility is no longer
necessary; or if the safety or health of other individuals would be
endangered. §1396r(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The exceptions
to the advance-notice requirement, too, turn (inter alia) on
the “resident’s health,” the
“resident’s urgent medical needs,” or the
existence of threats to the safety or health of other individuals
in the nursing home. §§1396r(c)(2)(B)(ii)(I)–(III)
(emphasis added).

															To be sure, these two provisions also establish
who it is that must respect and honor these statutory rights;
namely, the Medicaid-participant nursing homes in which these
residents reside. See, e.g., §§1396a(a)(28),
1396r(c)(1)(A), 1396r(c)(2)(A); see also
§§1396r(c)(1)(B)(i)–(ii) (requiring nursing homes
to inform nursing-home residents of their rights, orally and in
writing, upon admission and upon request). But that is not a
material diversion from the necessary focus on the nursing-home
residents, contrary to HHC’s representations. Indeed, it
would be strange to hold that a statutory provision fails to secure
rights simply because it considers, alongside the rights bearers,
the actors that might threaten those rights (and we have never so
held).[12]

															The unnecessary-restraint and
predischarge-notice provisions thus stand in stark contrast to the
statutory provisions that failed Gonzaga’s test in
Gonzaga itself. Those provisions lacked
“rights-creating language,” primarily directed the
Federal Government’s “distribution of public
funds,” and had “an aggregate, not individual,
focus.” 536 U. S., at 290. The opposite is true here.
The unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice provisions use
clear “rights-creating language,” speak
“ ‘in terms of the persons
benefited,’ ” and have an
“ ‘unmistakable focus on the benefited
class.’ ” Id., at 284, 287, 290 (emphasis
deleted). Thus, they satisfy Gonzaga’s stringent
standard, and the rights they recognize are presumptively
enforceable under §1983.

															C

															Even if a statutory provision unambiguously
secures rights, a defendant “may defeat t[he] presumption by
demonstrating that Congress did not intend” that §1983
be available to enforce those rights. Rancho Palos Verdes,
544 U. S., at 120.[13]
For evidence of such intent, we have looked to “the statute
creating the right.” Ibid. A statute could, of course,
expressly forbid §1983’s use. Fitzgerald, 555
U. S., at 252; Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at
120. Absent such a sign, a defendant must show that Congress
issued the same command implicitly, by creating “a
‘comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with
individual enforcement under §1983.’ ”
Id., at 120. Only the latter path is at issue here.

															1

															Our precedent outlines what HHC must show to
traverse the implicit-preclusion path. “ ‘The
crucial consideration’ ” is whether
“Congress intended a statute’s remedial scheme to
‘be the exclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may
assert [his] claims.’ ” Fitzgerald, 555
U. S., at 252 (quoting Smith v. Robinson,
468 U.S.
992, 1009, 1012 (1984) (emphasis added)); Fitzgerald,
555 U. S., at 252 (framing “ ‘[t]he critical
question’ ” as “ ‘whether
Congress meant [the statute’s remedial scheme] to coexist
with . . . a §1983 action’ ”
(quoting Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at
120–121)).

															Our precedents make clear that the sine qua
non of a finding that Congress implicitly intended to preclude
a private right of action under §1983 is incompatibility
between enforcement under §1983 and the enforcement scheme
that Congress has enacted. 555 U. S., at 252–254. We
have used many terms and concepts to describe the necessary
discordance between §1983 and a rights-conferring
statute’s remedial scheme:
“ ‘incompatible,’ ”
“ ‘inconsistent,’ ” and
“thwar[t]” are examples. Id., at 252–255.
In all events, the question is whether the design of the
enforcement scheme in the rights-conferring statute is inconsistent
with enforcement under §1983, such that a court must infer
that “Congress did not intend” to make available the
“[§1983] remedy for [these] newly created
right[s].” Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at
120; see also Fitzgerald, 555 U. S., at 252.

															Put another way, the inquiry boils down to what
Congress intended, as divined from text and context. The
application of the traditional tools of statutory construction to a
statute’s remedial scheme may reveal no incompatibility
between the enforcement scheme that Congress crafted in the
rights-conferring statute and enforcement under §1983, or it
may uncover sufficient incompatibility to make manifest
Congress’s intent to preclude §1983 actions. See,
e.g., id., at 253 (explaining a past
implicit-preclusion case on the ground that permitting §1983
claims there would have “thwarted Congress’
intent”); Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 127
(§1983’s operation would have “distort[ed]”
the pertinent other statute’s remedial scheme).

															2

															We discern no incompatibility between the
FNHRA’s remedial scheme and §1983 enforcement of the
rights that the unnecessary-restraint and predischarge-notice
provisions unambiguously secure.

															As explained in Part III–A, supra,
the FNHRA details administrative processes concerning inspection of
covered nursing facilities and accountability for noncompliant
facilities. But the statute lacks any indicia of congressional
intent to preclude §1983 enforcement, such as an express
private judicial right of action or any other provision that might
signify that intent. See, e.g., id., at 121
(“[T]he existence of a more restrictive private remedy [in
the statute itself] for statutory violations has been the dividing
line between those cases in which we have held that an action would
lie under §1983 and those in which we have held that it would
not”). Nor has HHC otherwise demonstrated that enforcement
via §1983 would thwart the operation of the administrative
remedial scheme in any respect.

															HHC’s argument that we need look no
further than the detail of the FNHRA’s enforcement mechanisms
to find conclusive evidence of implicit preclusion is unpersuasive.
Implicit preclusion is shown by a “ ‘comprehensive
enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual
enforcement under §1983.’ ”
Fitzgerald, 555 U. S., at 252 (emphasis added).
HHC’s single-minded focus on comprehensiveness mistakes the
shadow for the substance, and it disregards the import of these
FNHRA provisions’ unambiguous conferral of rights. The
attendant presumption is that §1983 can play its textually
prescribed role as a vehicle for enforcing those rights, even
alongside a detailed enforcement regime that also protects those
interests, so long as §1983 enforcement is not
“ ‘incompatible’ ” with
Congress’s handiwork. Rancho Palos Verdes, 544
U. S., at 120, 122; Blessing v. Freestone,
520 U.S.
329, 347–348 (1997) (collecting cases).

															To be clear, a defendant can discharge
its burden of showing that the presumption is rebutted by pointing
to a comprehensive scheme. Middlesex County Sewerage
Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S.
1, 20 (1981) (statutory “remedial devices” that are
“sufficiently comprehensive . . . may
suffice” to show implicit preclusion). But when a particular
comprehensive remedial scheme discharges the defendant’s
burden, it does so because the application of ordinary interpretive
tools reveals incompatibility, i.e., it demonstrates that
“Congress intended [that] statute’s remedial scheme to
be the ‘exclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert
[his] claims.’ ” Fitzgerald, 555
U. S., at 252.

															Nothing in the FNHRA indicates the
incompatibility evinced in our three prior cases finding implicit
preclusion. Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at
120–123, 127; Smith, 468 U. S., at
1008–1013; Sea Clammers, 453 U. S., at 6–7,
19–21. Rancho Palos Verdes, Smith, and Sea
Clammers concerned statutes with self-contained enforcement
schemes that included statute-specific rights of action. Rancho
Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 120–123; Smith,
468 U. S., at 1008–1012; Sea Clammers, 453
U. S., at 6–7, 17, and n. 27, 19–21. Each such
statute required plaintiffs to “comply with particular
procedures and/or to exhaust particular administrative
remedies” under the statute’s enforcement scheme before
suing under its dedicated right of action. Fitzgerald, 555
U. S., at 254. And each statute-specific right of action
offered fewer benefits than those available under §1983.
Ibid., and n. 1. Thus, in all three cases,
§1983’s operation would have thwarted Congress’s
scheme coming and going: It would have “circumvented”
the statutes’ presuit procedures, and would have also
“given plaintiffs access to tangible benefits” as
remedies that were “unavailable under the statutes.”
Id., at 254. Those “ ‘comprehensive
enforcement scheme[s]’ ” were
“ ‘incompatible with individual enforcement under
§1983.’ ” Id., at 252 (quoting
Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 120).

															HHC has identified no equivalent sign in the
FNHRA; nor has Justice Alito, see post, at 1, 3–5
(dissenting opinion). In focusing on what the FNHRA contains, they
ignore what it lacks—a private judicial right of action, a
private federal administrative remedy, or any
“ ‘carefu[l]’ ” congressional
“ ‘tailor[ing],’ ”
Fitzgerald, 555 U. S., at 255, that §1983 actions
would “distort,” Rancho Palos Verdes, 544
U. S., at 127. HHC seems to think it enough to show that
Congress was not slipshod in crafting the remedial scheme. But in a
world where the FNHRA’s remedial scheme could
“complement,” not “supplant, §1983,”
id., at 122, HHC must demonstrate more than that.

															One last rebuttal argument warrants addressing.
The United States says that, because private entities owned most
nursing homes when the FNHRA was enacted in 1987 (as they do now),
the FNHRA is a rare bird for implicit- preclusion purposes. In the
United States’ view, because Congress knew that most nursing
homes could not be subject to suit under §1983 anyway, see,
e.g., Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S.
312, 317–319 (1981), the FNHRA’s remedial scheme
“necessarily reflects Congress’s judgment that these
administrative enforcement mechanisms appropriately protect the
rights the statute confers,” Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 31.

															This argument is unavailing. The
implicit-preclusion inquiry looks to “the statute
creating the right” and any “ ‘comprehensive
enforcement scheme’ ” Congress has created in the
statute “ ‘that is incompatible with individual
enforcement under §1983.’ ” Rancho Palos
Verdes, 544 U. S., at 120 (emphasis added). It does not
invite speculation about ostensible marketplace realities that
appear nowhere in the statute’s text or relevant context. The
relevant FNHRA provisions speak in neutral terms that do not
distinguish between private and public nursing homes. And,
regardless, the question remains whether something in the FNHRA has
foreclosed §1983’s “genera[l]” availability
as “a remedy for the vindication of rights secured by federal
statutes.” Gonzaga, 536 U. S., at 284. We see no
such sign, much less a license for us to construct and impute
congressional intent that the FNHRA does not embody.

															The difficulty for HHC and the United States is
that implicit preclusion, in this context, requires something in
the statute that shows that permitting §1983 to operate would
“thwar[t] Congress’ intent” in crafting the
FNHRA. Fitzgerald, 555 U. S., at 253. We see nothing in
the FNHRA that even hints at Congress’s intent in this
regard; if anything, the language of the Act confirms otherwise,
for it plainly states that “[t]he remedies provided
under” its enforcement-process subsection are “in
addition to those otherwise available under State or Federal
law and shall not be construed as limiting such other
remedies.” §1396r(h)(8) (emphasis added).[14] We will not rewrite §1396r(h)(8)
in lieu of rewriting §1983.[15]

															*  *  *

															At oral argument, HHC’s counsel remarked
that the “right question” is “what rights are
secured by law within the meaning of §1983.” Tr. of Oral
Arg. 39. That is an accurate statement of the key issue in this
case. Section 1983 itself provides the answer. By its terms,
§1983 is available to enforce every right that Congress
validly and unambiguously creates; we will not impose a categorical
font-of-power condition that the Reconstruction Congress did not.
And, here, the test that our precedents establish leads inexorably
to the conclusion that the FNHRA secures the particular rights that
Talevski invokes, without otherwise signaling that enforcement of
those rights via §1983 is precluded as incompatible with the
FNHRA’s remedial scheme.

															Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court
of Appeals.

															It is so ordered.

 Encapsulating the Report,

 For example, we have
recognized immunities in the §1983 context when a
“ ‘tradition of immunity was so firmly rooted in
the common law and was supported by such strong policy reasons that
“Congress would have specifically so provided had it wished
to abolish” ’ ” that particular
immunity. Wyatt, 504 U. S., at 164 (quoting Owen

341 U.S.
367, 372–376 (1951) (rooting immunity in a well-settled,
pre-Revolutionary tradition that Congress could not be thought to
have “covert[ly]” abrogated). We relied on similar
reasoning when consulting well-settled common-law principles to
determine the “contours of a [§1983] claim,”

brief ’s categorical claims about the scope of
§1983. In any event, the well-established requirement that
Congress must have “unambiguously conferred” a

the clear notice that HHC’s reply brief requests.

10  The
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 added the FNHRA to Title
XIX of the Social Security Act, i.e., Medicaid. See 101Stat.
1330–182. The FNHRA added a materially identical section to
the Medicare-focused portion of the Social Security Act, 101Stat.
1330–160, 42 U. S. C. §1395i–3
et seq. Because Talevski’s complaint relies only
on the Medicaid-related FNHRA provisions, App. to Pet. for Cert.
76a, we hereafter follow the parties and the Court of Appeals in
referring only to the pertinent Medicaid provisions, as codified in
the U. S. Code (§§1396a(a)(28), 1396r).
11  “Nursing facility” is the
FNHRA’s term for a nursing home. §1396r(a).
12  The
Fourteenth Amendment hardly fails to secure §1983-enforceable
rights because it directs state actors not to deny equal
protection.
13  The
“ ‘rebuttable presumption’ ” that
our cases describe, Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at
120, is not an artificially onerous court-made hurdle. It merely
reflects what §1983’s plain text commands: The
§1983 remedy is available to vindicate federal individual
rights “secured by . . . la[w].” In other
words, the presumption recognizes that, even where Congress has
unambiguously secured certain federal individual rights by law, it
may have simultaneously given good reason (detectable with
ordinary interpretive tools) to conclude that the §1983 remedy
is not available for those rights, even though it
“generally” is. Gonzaga, 536 U. S., at 284,
and n. 4. And it also recognizes that it is the
defendant’s burden to show that a right otherwise secured by
law is not §1983 enforceable. Rancho Palos Verdes, 544
U. S., at 120; Gonzaga, 536 U. S., at 284, and
n. 4.
14  We
found similar (but not identical) language to be insufficient to
preserve the presumption in Middlesex County Sewerage
Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1
(1981), and Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, 544 U.S.
113 (2005). See id., at 125–127. But those clauses
did not purport to preserve “other remedies,” and were
embedded in statutes that (unlike the FNHRA) contained private
judicial rights of action. See ibid.; Sea Clammers,
453 U. S., at 6–7, 20, and n. 31. The FNHRA’s
explicitly expressed objective of preserving other remedies
bolsters our reluctance to infer implicit displacement of the
§1983 remedy. We think Justice Alito’s response in this
regard overreads Rancho Palos Verdes. See post, at 6.
That case merely provided an unremarkable description of Sea
Clammers’ “refus[al] to read” the saving
clauses there as preserving §1983 actions, in light of the
different (and significant) textual and contextual evidence of
preclusion that the statutes at issue provided. Rancho Palos
Verdes, 544 U. S., at 127.
15  The
United States’ suggestion that §1396r(h)(8) just ensures
that remedies available under non-FNHRA, non-§1983 statutes
remain available is not persuasive. Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 34. Nothing in the Act supports interpreting
§1396r(h)(8)’s language in that manner, especially given
§1983’s unqualified command.
