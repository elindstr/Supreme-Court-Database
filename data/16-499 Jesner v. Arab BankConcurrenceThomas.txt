															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															JOSEPH JESNER, et al., PETITIONERS v. ARAB BANK, PLC

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full because it correctly applies our precedents.  I also agree with the points raised by my concurring colleagues.  Courts should not be in the business of creating new causes of action under the Alien Tort Statute, see post, at 2–5 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), especially when it risks international strife, see post, at 3–7 (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  And the Alien Tort Statute likely does not apply to suits between foreign plaintiffs and foreign defendants.  See post, at 5–14 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).
