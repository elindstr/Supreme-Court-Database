															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–1168

															_________________

															ROBERT MALLORY, PETITIONER v. NORFOLK
SOUTHERN RAILWAY CO.

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
pennsylvania, eastern district

															[June 27, 2023]

															Justice Barrett, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice Kagan, and Justice Kavanaugh join, dissenting.

															For 75 years, we have held that the Due Process
Clause does not allow state courts to assert general jurisdiction
over foreign defendants merely because they do business in the
State. International Shoe Co. v. Washington,
326 U.S.
310, 317 (1945). Pennsylvania nevertheless claims general
jurisdiction over all corporations that lawfully do business within
its borders. As the Commonwealth’s own courts recognized,
that flies in the face of our precedent. See Daimler AG v.
Bauman, 571 U.S.
117, 139–140 (2014).

															The Court finds a way around this settled rule.
All a State must do is compel a corporation to register to conduct
business there (as every State does) and enact a law making
registration sufficient for suit on any cause (as every State could
do). Then, every company doing business in the State is subject to
general jurisdiction based on implied
“consent”—not contacts. That includes suits, like
this one, with no connection whatsoever to the forum.

															Such an approach does not formally overrule our
traditional contacts-based approach to jurisdiction, but it might
as well. By relabeling their long-arm statutes, States may now
manufacture “consent” to personal jurisdiction. Because
I would not permit state governments to circumvent constitutional
limits so easily, I respectfully dissent.

															I

															A

															Personal jurisdiction is the authority of a
court to issue a judgment that binds a defendant. If a defendant
submits to a court’s authority, the court automatically
acquires personal jurisdiction. Insurance Corp. of Ireland
v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456
U.S. 694, 703 (1982). But if a defendant contests the
court’s authority, the court must determine whether it can
nevertheless assert coercive power over the defendant. That
calculus turns first on the statute or rule defining the persons
within the court’s reach. See World-Wide Volkswagen
Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S.
286, 290 (1980). It depends next on the Due Process Clause,
which guards a defendant’s right to resist the judicial
authority of a sovereign to which it has an insufficient tie.
International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 316. The Clause has
the companion role of ensuring that state courts “do not
reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by their status as
coequal sovereigns in a federal system.” World-Wide
Volkswagen, 444 U. S., at 291–292.

															Our precedent divides personal jurisdiction into
two categories: specific and general. Both are subject to the
demands of the Due Process Clause. Specific jurisdiction, as its
name suggests, allows a state court to adjudicate specific claims
against a defendant. When a defendant “purposefully avails
itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum
State,” Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S.
235, 253 (1958), that State’s courts may adjudicate
claims that “ ‘arise out of or relate to the
defendant’s contacts’ with the forum,” Ford
Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 592
U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 6) (quoting
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of Cal.,
San Francisco Cty., 582 U.S. 255, 262 (2017)).

															General jurisdiction, by contrast, allows a
state court to adjudicate “ ‘any and all
claims’ brought against a defendant.” Ford
Motor, 592 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (quoting
Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S. A. v.
Brown, 564 U.S.
915, 919 (2011)). This sweeping authority exists only when the
defendant’s connection to the State is tight—so tight,
in fact, that the defendant is “ ‘at
home’ ” there. Ford Motor, 592 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 5). An individual is typically “at
home” in her domicile, Goodyear, 564 U. S., at
924, and a corporation is typically “at home” in both
its place of incorporation and principal place of business,
Daimler, 571 U. S., at 137. Absent an exceptional
circumstance, general jurisdiction is cabined to these locations.
Id., at 139.

															B

															This case involves a Pennsylvania statute
authorizing courts to exercise general jurisdiction over
corporations that are not “at home” in the
Commonwealth. All foreign corporations must register to do business
in Pennsylvania, 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. §411(a) (2014), and all
registrants are subject to suit on “any cause” in the
Commonwealth’s courts, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat.
§§5301(a)(2)(i), (b) (2019). Section 5301 thus purports
to empower Pennsylvania courts to adjudicate any and all claims
against corporations doing business there.

															As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court recognized,
this statute “clearly, palpably, and plainly violates the
Constitution.” 266 A.3d 542, 565–566 (2021). Look no
further than BNSF R. Co. v. Tyrrell, a case with
remarkably similar facts—and one that the Court conspicuously
ignores. 581 U.S. 402 (2017). There, we assessed whether
Montana’s courts could exercise general jurisdiction over the
BNSF railroad. No plaintiff resided in Montana or suffered an
injury there. Like Mallory, one of the plaintiffs alleged that the
railroad exposed him to toxic substances that caused his cancer.
Id., at 406. Like Norfolk Southern, BNSF had tracks and
employees in the forum, but it was neither incorporated nor
headquartered there. Id., at 406–407. We rejected
Montana’s assertion of general jurisdiction over BNSF because
“in-state business . . . does not suffice to permit
the assertion of general jurisdiction over claims . . .
that are unrelated to any activity occurring in [the State].”
Id., at 414. Daimler and Goodyear, we
explained, could not have made that any clearer. BNSF, 581
U. S., at 414.

															The same rule applies here. The Pennsylvania
statute announces that registering to do business in the
Commonwealth “shall constitute a sufficient basis” for
general jurisdiction. §5301(a). But as our precedent makes
crystal clear, simply doing business is insufficient. Absent
an exceptional circumstance, a corporation is subject to general
jurisdiction only in a State where it is incorporated or has its
principal place of business. Ford Motor, 592 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 5); Daimler, 571 U. S., at 139;
Goodyear, 564 U. S., at 924. Adding the antecedent step
of registration does not change that conclusion. If it did,
“every corporation would be subject to general jurisdiction
in every state in which it registered, and Daimler’s
ruling would be robbed of meaning by a back-door thief.”
Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 814 F.3d 619, 640
(CA2 2016).

															II

															A

															The Court short-circuits this precedent by
characterizing this case as one about consent rather than
contacts-based jurisdiction. Consent is an established basis for
personal jurisdiction, which is, after all, a waivable defense.
“A variety of legal arrangements have been taken to represent
express or implied consent to the personal jurisdiction of the
court,” including contract, stipulation, and in-court
appearance. Insurance Corp. of Ireland, 456 U. S., at
703–704. Today, the Court adds corporate registration to the
list.

															This argument begins on shaky ground, because
Pennsylvania itself does not treat registration as synonymous with
consent. Section 5301(a)(2)(i) baldly asserts that
“qualification as a foreign corporation” in the
Commonwealth is a sufficient hook for general jurisdiction. The
next subsection (invoked by neither Mallory nor the Court)
permits the exercise of general jurisdiction over a corporation
based on “[c]onsent, to the extent authorized by the
consent.” §5301(a)(2)(ii). If registration were actual
consent, one would expect to see some mention of jurisdiction in
Norfolk Southern’s registration paperwork—which is
instead wholly silent on the matter. App. 1–7. What Mallory
calls “consent” is what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
called “compelled submission to general jurisdiction by
legislative command.” 266 A. 3d, at 569. Corporate
registration triggers a statutory repercussion, but that is not
“consent” in a conventional sense of the word.

															To pull §5301(a)(2)(i) under the umbrella
of consent, the Court, following Mallory, casts it as setting the
terms of a bargain: In exchange for access to the Pennsylvania
market, a corporation must allow the Commonwealth’s courts to
adjudicate any and all claims against it, even those (like
Mallory’s) having nothing to do with Pennsylvania. Brief for
Petitioner 27–28. Everyone is charged with knowledge of the
law, so corporations are on notice of the deal. By registering,
they agree to its terms.

															While this is a clever theory, it falls apart on
inspection. The Court grounds consent in a corporation’s
choice to register with knowledge (constructive or actual) of the
jurisdictional consequences. Ante, at 10–11, 21
(“proceed[ing] anyway” in light of “the
jurisdictional consequences attending these actions”);
ante, at 2 (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment) (basing “consent” on “presume[d]”
knowledge of state law); ante, at 3 (Jackson, J.,
concurring) (“register[ing] and do[ing] business in
Pennsylvania despite the jurisdictional consequences”). But
on that logic, any long-arm statute could be said to elicit
consent. Imagine a law that simply provides, “any corporation
doing business in this State is subject to general jurisdiction in
our courts.” Such a law defies our precedent, which, again,
holds that “in-state business . . . does not
suffice to permit the assertion of general jurisdiction.”
BNSF, 581 U. S., at 414. Yet this hypothetical law,
like the Pennsylvania statute, gives notice that general
jurisdiction is the price of doing business. And its
“notice” is no less “clear” than
Pennsylvania’s. Ante, at 5 (opinion of Alito, J.). So
on the Court’s reasoning, corporations that choose to do
business in the State impliedly consent to general jurisdiction.
The result: A State could defeat the Due Process Clause by adopting
a law at odds with the Due Process Clause.

															That makes no sense. If the hypothetical statute
overreaches, then Pennsylvania’s does too. As the United
States observes, “[i]nvoking the label ‘consent’
rather than ‘general jurisdiction’ does not render
Pennsylvania’s long-arm statute constitutional.” Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 4. Yet the Court takes
this route without so much as acknowledging its circularity.

															B

															While our due process precedent permits States
to place reasonable conditions on foreign corporations in exchange
for access to their markets, there is nothing reasonable about a
State extracting consent in cases where it has “no connection
whatsoever.” 266 A. 3d, at 566; Bristol-Myers,
582 U. S., at 263; see Lafayette Ins. Co. v.
French, 18 How. 404, 407 (1856). The Due Process Clause
protects more than the rights of defendants—it also protects
interstate federalism. We have emphasized this principle in case
after case. For instance, in Hanson v. Denckla, we
stressed that “restrictions” on personal jurisdiction
“are more than a guarantee of immunity from inconvenient or
distant litigation. They are a consequence of territorial
limitations on the power of the respective States.” 357
U. S., at 250–251. In World-Wide Volkswagen, we
explained that “[e]ven if the defendant would suffer minimal
or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the
tribunals of another State . . . the Due Process Clause,
acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act
to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.”
444 U. S., at 294. And in Bristol-Myers, we reinforced
that “this federalism interest may be decisive.” 582
U. S., at 263; see also, e.g., Ford Motor, 592
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6); Asahi Metal Industry
Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty.,
480 U.S.
102, 113, 115 (1987); International Shoe, 326
U. S., at 317. A defendant’s ability to waive its
objection to personal jurisdiction reflects that the Clause
protects, first and foremost, an individual right. But when a State
announces a blanket rule that ignores the territorial boundaries on
its power, federalism interests are implicated too.

															Pennsylvania’s effort to assert general
jurisdiction over every company doing business within its borders
infringes on the sovereignty of its sister States in a way no less
“exorbitant” and “grasping” than attempts
we have previously rejected.[1]
Daimler, 571 U. S., at 121–122, 138–139.
Conditions on doing in-state business cannot be “inconsistent
with those rules of public law which secure the jurisdiction and
authority of each State from encroachment by all others.”
Lafayette, 18 How., at 407; St. Clair v. Cox,
106 U.S.
350, 356 (1882). Permitting Pennsylvania to impose a blanket
claim of authority over controversies with no connection to the
Commonwealth intrudes on the prerogatives of other
States—domestic and foreign—to adjudicate the rights of
their citizens and enforce their own laws. See Ford Motor,
592 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 6–7);
Daimler, 571 U. S., at 141–142.

															The plurality’s response is to fall back,
yet again, on “consent.” Ante, at 21, 23,
n. 11. In its view, because a defendant can waive its
personal jurisdiction right, a State can never overreach in
demanding its relinquishment. Ibid.; see also
ante, at 8 (opinion of Alito, J.); ante, at 1–3
(opinion of Jackson, J.). That is not how we treat rights with
structural components. The right to remove a case to federal court,
for instance, is primarily personal—it secures for a
nonresident defendant a federal forum thought to be more impartial.
See The Federalist No. 80, p. 478 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A.
Hamilton). At the same time, however, it serves federal interests
by ensuring that federal courts can vindicate federal rights. See,
e.g., Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S.
780, 804–805 (1966). Recognizing this dual role, we have
rejected efforts of States to require defendants to relinquish this
(waivable) right to removal as a condition of doing business. See
Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445, 453,
456–458 (1874) (citing Lafayette, 18 How., at 407);
Barron v. Burnside, 121 U.S.
186, 196–198 (1887) (“[W]hile the right to remove a
suit might be waived,” a statute may not require a foreign
corporation “to forfeit [its] rights at all times and on all
occasions, whenever the case might be presented”). The same
logic applies here. Pennsylvania’s power grab infringes on
more than just the rights of defendants—it upsets the proper
role of the States in our federal system.

															III

															A

															The plurality attempts to minimize the novelty
of its conclusion by pointing to our decision in Burnham v.
Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U.S.
604 (1990). There, we considered whether “tag
jurisdiction”—personal service upon a defendant
physically present in the forum State—remains an effective
basis for general jurisdiction after International Shoe.
Burnham, 495 U. S., at 607 (opinion of Scalia, J.). We
unanimously agreed that it does. Id., at 619, 622;
id., at 628 (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment); id., at 628–629 (Brennan, J., concurring in
judgment); id., at 640 (Stevens, J., concurring in
judgment). The plurality claims that registration jurisdiction for
a corporation is just as valid as the “tag
jurisdiction” that we approved in Burnham. But in
drawing this analogy, the plurality omits any discussion of
Burnham’s reasoning.

															In Burnham, we acknowledged that tag
jurisdiction would not satisfy the contacts-based test for general
jurisdiction. Nonetheless, we reasoned that tag jurisdiction is
“both firmly approved by tradition and still favored,”
making it “one of the continuing traditions of our legal
system that define[s] the due process standard of
‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial
justice.’ ” Id., at 619 (opinion of Scalia,
J.) (quoting International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 316);
see also 495 U. S., at 635–637 (Brennan, J., concurring
in judgment) (a jurisdictional rule that reflects “our common
understanding now, fortified by a century of judicial
practice, . . . is entitled to a strong presumption that
it comports with due process”). Burnham thus permits a
longstanding and still-accepted basis for jurisdiction to pass
International Shoe’s test.

															General-jurisdiction-by-registration flunks both
of these prongs: It is neither “firmly approved by
tradition” nor “still favored.” 495 U. S.,
at 622 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Thus, the plurality’s analogy
to tag jurisdiction is superficial at best.

															Start with the second prong. In Burnham,
“[w]e [did] not know of a single state . . . that
[had] abandoned in-state service as a basis of jurisdiction.”
Id., at 615. Here, as Mallory concedes, Pennsylvania is the
only State with a statute treating registration as
sufficient for general jurisdiction. Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. Indeed,
quite a few have jettisoned the jurisdictional consequences of
corporate registration altogether—and in no uncertain terms.
See, e.g., Chavez v. Bridgestone Americas Tire
Operations, LLC, 2022–NMSC–006,
¶¶1, 53–54, 503 P.3d 332, 336, 349 (“Reliance
upon outdated legal fictions . . . would be absurd and,
as explained above, inconsistent with contemporary understandings
of due process”); Genuine Parts Co. v. Cepec,
137 A.3d 123, 137 (Del. 2016) (“[W]e no longer live in a time
where foreign corporations cannot operate in other states unless
they somehow become a resident”); see also DeLeon v.
BNSF R. Co., 392 Mont. 446, 453, n. 1, 426 P.3d 1, 7,
n. 1 (2018) (listing States with statutes that do not permit
the practice).[2] With the
Pennsylvania Legislature standing alone, the plurality does not
even attempt to describe this method of securing general
jurisdiction as “still favored,” Burnham, 495
U. S., at 622 (opinion of Scalia, J.), or reflective of
“our common understanding now,” id., at
635–637 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis
deleted). Quite the opposite: The plurality denigrates “the
spirit of our age”—reflected by the vast majority of
States—and appeals to its own notions of fairness.
Ante, at 17–20.

															The past is as fatal to the plurality’s
theory as the present. Burnham’s tradition prong asks
whether a method for securing jurisdiction was “shared by
American courts at the crucial time”—“1868, when
the Fourteenth Amendment

															was adopted.” 495 U. S., at 611
(opinion of Scalia, J.). But the plurality cannot identify a
single case from that period supporting its theory.[3] In fact, the evidence runs in the
opposite direction. Statutes that required the appointment of a
registered agent for service of process were far more modest than
Pennsylvania’s.[4] And
even when a statute was written more broadly, state courts
generally understood it to implicitly limit jurisdiction to suits
with a connection to the forum. The state reporters are replete
with examples of judicial decisions that stood by the
then-prevailing rule: Compliance with a registration law did not
subject a foreign corporation to suit on any cause in a
State, but only those related to the forum. Smith v.
Mutual Life Ins. Co. of N. Y., 96 Mass. 336,
340–343 (1867); see also, e.g., Camden Rolling
Mill v. Swede Iron Co., 32 N. J. L. 15, 18
(1866) (rejecting a statutory construction that would “place
within the jurisdiction of our courts, all the corporations of the
world”); Newell v. Great W. R. Co. of Canada,
19 Mich. 336, 345–346 (1869) (legislature “could never
have intended . . . to make our tribunals, maintained by
the people of Michigan, the arbiters of differences in which our
citizens have no interest”); Sawyer v. North Am.
Life Ins. Co., 46 Vt. 697, 707 (1874) (broadly worded statute
did not reach a corporate “party not a resident, on a cause
of action which did not accrue here”); Central R. &
Banking Co. v. Carr, 76 Ala. 388, 393 (1884) (collecting
cases).[5] Our cases from this
era articulate the same line. See, e.g., Lafayette,
18 How., at 407 (statutory consent to suit may reach
“contracts made and to be performed within that
State”); St. Clair, 106 U. S., at 356–357
(statutory consent permitted for suits “arising out of [a
foreign corporation’s] transactions in the State”);
Old Wayne Mut. Life Assn. of Indianapolis v.
McDonough, 204 U.S.
8, 21 (1907) (“[I]t cannot be held that the company
agreed that service of process . . . would alone be
sufficient to bring it into court in respect of all business
transacted by it, no matter where”); Simon v.
Southern R. Co., 236 U.S.
115, 130 (1915) (“statutory consent of a foreign
corporation to be sued does not extend to causes of action arising
in other states”). Although “plaintiffs typically did
not sue defendants in fora that had no rational relation to causes
of action,” Genuine Parts, 137 A. 3d, at 146,
courts repeatedly turned them away when they did.

															B

															Sidestepping Burnham’s logic, the
plurality seizes on its bottom-line approval of tag jurisdiction.
According to the plurality, tag jurisdiction (based on physical
presence) and registration jurisdiction (based on deemed consent)
are essentially the same thing—so by blessing one,
Burnham blessed the other. See ante, at 1–2,
16. The plurality never explains why they are the same, even
though—as we have just discussed—more than a
century’s worth of law treats them as distinct. See also
Burnham, 495 U. S., at 610, n. 1 (opinion of
Scalia, J.) (corporations “have never fi[t] comfortably in a
jurisdictional regime based primarily upon ‘de facto power
over the defendant’s person’ ”);
International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 316–317. The
plurality’s rationale seems to be that if a person is subject
to general jurisdiction anywhere she is present, then a corporation
should be subject to general jurisdiction anywhere it does
business. See ante, at 1–2, 5–6, 9–10, 16,
22. That is not only a non sequitur—it is “contrary to
the historical rationale of International Shoe.”
Wenche Siemer v. Learjet Acquisition Corp., 966 F.2d
179, 183 (CA5 1992).

															Before International Shoe, a state
court’s power over a person turned strictly on “service
of process within the State” (presence) “or [her]
voluntary appearance” (consent). Pennoyer v.
Neff, 95 U.S.
714, 733 (1878). In response to changes in interstate business
and transportation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
States deployed new legal fictions designed to secure the presence
or consent of nonresident individuals and foreign corporations. For
example, state laws required nonresident drivers to give their
“implied consent” to be sued for their in-state
accidents as a condition of using the road. Hess v.
Pawloski, 274 U.S.
352, 356 (1927); World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U. S.,
at 296, n. 11. And foreign corporations, as we have discussed,
were required by statute to “consent” to the
appointment of a resident agent, so that the company could then be
constructively “present” for in-state service.
Mutual Reserve Fund Life Assn. v. Phelps, 190 U.S.
147, 158–159 (1903); see St. Clair, 106
U. S., at 356.

															As Justice Scalia explained, such extensions of
“consent and presence were purely fictional” and can no
longer stand after International Shoe. Burnham, 495
U. S., at 618; see also, e.g., Shaffer v.
Heitner, 433 U.S.
186, 202–203 (1977) (International Shoe abandoned
“both the fictions of implied consent to service on the part
of a foreign corporation and of corporate presence”);
McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S.
220, 222 (1957) (International Shoe “abandoned
‘consent,’ ‘doing business,’ and
‘presence’ as the standard for measuring the extent of
state judicial power over [foreign] corporations”);
International Shoe, 326 U. S., at 318. The very point
of International Shoe was to “cast . . .
aside” the legal fictions built on the old territorial
approach to personal jurisdiction and replace them with its
contacts-based test. Burnham, 495 U. S., at 618
(opinion of Scalia, J.); id., at 630 (Brennan, J.,
concurring in judgment) (International Shoe abandoned the
previous “ ‘patchwork of legal and factual
fictions’ ”). In Burnham, we upheld tag
jurisdiction because it is not one of those fictions—it
is presence. By contrast, Pennsylvania’s registration
statute is based on deemed consent. And this kind of legally
implied consent is one of the very fictions that our decision in
International Shoe swept away. See 326 U. S., at 318;
Ford Motor, 592 U. S., at ___ (Gorsuch, J., concurring
in judgment) (slip op., at 8).

															C

															Neither Justice Alito nor the plurality
seriously contests this history. Nor does either deny that
Mallory’s theory would gut Daimler. Instead, they
insist that we already decided this question in a
pre-International Shoe precedent: Pennsylvania Fire Ins.
Co. of Philadelphia v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling
Co., 243 U.S.
93 (1917).

															In Pennsylvania Fire, an Arizona
corporation sued a Pennsylvania corporation in Missouri for a claim
arising from an insurance contract issued in Colorado and
protecting property in Colorado. Id., at 94. The defendant
maintained that the Missouri court lacked personal jurisdiction
over it because the plaintiff ’s claim had no connection
to the forum. Id., at 94–95. But in compliance with
Missouri law, the defendant company had previously filed “a
power of attorney consenting that service of process upon the
superintendent [of the State’s insurance department] should
be deemed personal service upon the company.” Id., at
94. The Missouri Supreme Court construed that power of attorney as
express consent to personal jurisdiction in Missouri in any case
whatsoever, and this Court held that “the construction did
not deprive the defendant of due process of law.” Id.,
at 95.[6]

															The Court asserts that Pennsylvania Fire
controls our decision today. I disagree. The case was
“decided before this Court’s transformative decision on
personal jurisdiction in International Shoe,”
BNSF, 581 U. S., at 412, and we have already stated
that “prior decisions [that] are inconsistent with this
standard . . . are overruled,” Shaffer, 433
U. S., at 212, n. 39. Pennsylvania Fire fits that
bill. Time and again, we have reinforced that
“ ‘doing business’ tests”—like
those

															“framed before specific jurisdiction
evolved in the United States”—are not a valid basis for
general jurisdiction. Daimler, 571 U. S., at 140, n.
20. The only innovation of Pennsylvania’s statute is to make
“doing business” synonymous with “consent.”
If Pennsylvania Fire endorses that trick, then
Pennsylvania Fire is no longer good law.

															The plurality tries to get around
International Shoe by claiming that it did no more than
expand jurisdiction, affecting nothing that came before
it.[7] Ante, at
14–15. That is as fictional as the old concept of
“corporate presence” on which the plurality relies. We
have previously abandoned even “ancient” bases of
jurisdiction for incompatibility with International Shoe.
Shaffer, 433 U. S., at 211–212 (repudiating
quasi in rem jurisdiction). And we have
repeatedly reminded litigants not to put much stock in our
pre-International Shoe decisions. Shaffer, 433
U. S., at 212, n. 39; see also BNSF, 581
U. S., at 412. Daimler itself reinforces that
pre-International Shoe decisions “should not attract
heavy reliance today.” 571 U. S., at 138, n. 18.
Over and over, we have reminded litigants that International
Shoe is “canonical,” “seminal,”
“pathmarking,” and even
“momentous”—to give just a few examples. Ford
Motor, 592 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4);
Bristol-Myers, 582 U. S., at 262; Daimler, 571
U. S., at 128; Goodyear, 564 U. S., at 919. Yet
the Court acts as if none of this ever happened.

															In any event, I doubt Pennsylvania Fire
would control this case even if it remained valid. Pennsylvania
Fire distinguished between express consent (that is, consent
“actually . . . conferred by [the] document”)
and deemed consent (inferred from doing business). 243 U. S.,
at 95–96; see also Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem
Shipbuilding Corp., 308 U.S.
165, 175 (1939) (basing jurisdiction on “finding an
actual consent” (emphasis added)). As Judge Learned
Hand emphasized in a decision invoked by the plurality, without
“express consent,” the normal rules apply.
Smolik v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron
Co., 222 F. 148, 150–151 (SDNY 1915).

															The express power of attorney in Pennsylvania
Fire “made service on the [insurance] superintendent the
equivalent of . . . a corporate vote [that] had accepted
service in this specific case.” 243 U. S., at 95.
Norfolk Southern, by contrast, “executed no document like the
power of attorney there.” Brief for Respondent 31; see App.
1–7. The Court makes much of what Norfolk Southern did write
on its forms, ante, at 11: It named a “Commercial
Registered Office Provider,” App. 1, 6, it notified
Pennsylvania of a merger, id., at 3–5, and it paid $70
to update its paperwork, id., at 6. None of those documents
use the word “agent,” nothing hints at the word
“jurisdiction,” and (as the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
explained) nothing about that registration is
“voluntary.” 266 A. 3d, at 570, and
n. 20.[8] Consent in
Pennsylvania Fire was contained in the document itself; here
it is deemed by statute. If “mere formalities” matter
as much as the plurality says they do, it should respect this one
too. Ante, at 22.

															IV

															By now, it should be clear that the
plurality’s primary approach to this case is to look past our
personal jurisdiction

															

															precedent. Relying on a factsheet downloaded
from the internet, for instance, the plurality argues that Norfolk
Southern is such a “part of ‘the Pennsylvania
Community,’ ” and does so much business there,
that its “presence” in Pennsylvania is enough to
require it to stand for suits having nothing to do with the
Commonwealth. Ante, at 17–20; see also ante, at
4–5 (opinion of Alito, J.).[9] In Daimler, however, we roundly rejected the
plaintiff ’s request that we “approve the exercise
of general jurisdiction in every State in which a corporation
‘engages in a substantial, continuous, and systematic course
of business.’ ” 571 U. S., at 138. The
established test—which the plurality barely
acknowledges—is whether the corporation is “at
home” in the State. “A corporation that operates in
many places,” and must therefore register in just as many,
“can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them.”
Id., at 140, n. 20.

															***

															Critics of Daimler and Goodyear
may be happy to see them go. See, e.g., Ford Motor,
592 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (Alito, J., concurring in
judgment); id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 8–9)
(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in judgment);
BNSF, 581 U. S., at 416 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part). And make no mistake: They are halfway
out the door. If States take up the Court’s invitation to
manipulate registration, Daimler and Goodyear will be
obsolete, and, at least for corporations, specific jurisdiction
will be “superfluous.” Daimler, 571 U. S.,
at 140; see Goodyear, 564 U. S., at 925. Because I
would not work this sea change, I respectfully dissent.

Notes
1
 This case provides a
“textbook example” of overreach at the expense of other
States. 266 A.3d 542, 567 (Pa. 2021). Virginia has considerable
connections to Mallory’s suit: Mallory lives in Virginia,
Norfolk Southern is a Virginia corporation, Mallory’s
injuries arose—at least in part—from his employment in
Virginia, and he was diagnosed with cancer there. See ante,
at 2–3; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39. Pennsylvania, by contrast,
“has no legitimate interest in a controversy with no
connection to the Commonwealth that was filed by a non-resident
against a foreign corporation.” 266 A. 3d, at
567.
2
 The plurality offers only
one other State that (through its Supreme Court) has treated
foreign corporate registration as adequate support for general
jurisdiction following Daimler and Goodyear. See
Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. v. McCall, 312 Ga. 422,
436–437, 863 S.E.2d 81, 92 (2021). There, a judicial
precedent, not a long-arm statute, maintained that registration
justified general jurisdiction. Applying the consent theory, the
Georgia Supreme Court held that corporations that choose to do
business in the State are on notice of the jurisdictional
consequences of its case law. Id., at 434, 863 S. E.
2d, at 90.
3
 The plurality argues that
the uniform practice of state courts at the time of ratification is
inapposite because no state court held that
general-jurisdiction-by-registration violates the Fourteenth
Amendment. Ante, at 7, n. 4. This approach reflects a
misunderstanding of Burnham. The inquiry is not whether
courts rejected a process for obtaining jurisdiction as
unconstitutional. It is whether courts actually
used—and continue to use—the challenged process.
495 U. S., at 622 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see also
Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S.
516, 528 (1884) (“[A] process of law . . . must
be taken to be due process of law” if it “has been
immemorially the actual law of the land”). Registration
jurisdiction falls short on both fronts.
4
 Many States expressly
limited their statutes to disputes with a connection
to the State. See, e.g., Ind. Code
§25–2 (1852) (foreign corporations must consent to
actions “arising out of any transaction in this
State”), App. to Brief for Petitioner 47a; Conn. Gen. Stat.
§7–389 (1866) (foreign insurance companies must appoint
an in-state agent to accept process “in all suits before any
court in this state, for any liability incurred by such company or
association in this state”), App. to Brief for Petitioner
18a; Md. Code Ann. §26–211 (1868) (foreign corporation
may be sued by nonresident “when the cause of action has
arisen, or the subject of the action shall be situate[d] in this
state”), App. to Brief for Petitioner 90a; S. C. Code
Ann. §13–1–422(2) (1873) (nonresident may sue a
foreign corporation “when the cause of action shall have
arisen, or the subject of the action shall be situated, within this
State”), App. to Brief for Petitioner 227a.
5
 Mallory cannot find an
example of an exercise of registration jurisdiction without a forum
connection until 1882. See Johnston v. Trade Ins.
Co., 132 Mass. 432, 434–435. But even that example
ignores Massachusetts’s rejection of registration
jurisdiction for cases with no connection to the forum in
1867—the year it ratified the Fourteenth Amendment. See
Smith, 96 Mass., at 340–343.
6
 The plurality praises the
Missouri Supreme Court’s “carefu[l]” and
“thoughtful opinion.” Ante, at 9–10. Only
a decade later, however, the same court unanimously concluded that
it had misinterpreted the reach of the statute and overruled this
aggressive approach. State ex rel. Am. Central Life Ins.
Co. v. Landwehr, 318 Mo. 181, 190–192, 300 S.W.
294, 297–298 (1927) (requiring a connection to Missouri);
State ex rel. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co. of Hartford v.
Harris, 343 Mo. 252, 258–260, 121 S.W.2d 141,
145–146 (1938). This remains the rule in Missouri today:
Compliance with its registration statute does not constitute
consent to general jurisdiction. State ex rel.
Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. Dolan, 512 S.W.3d 41,
52–53, and n. 11 (Mo. 2017).

  While International
Shoe expanded the bases for specific jurisdiction, it
did no such thing for general jurisdiction. On the contrary,
International Shoe itself recognized that general
jurisdiction for a corporation exists in its “
‘home’ or principal place of business.” 326 U.S.
310, 317 (1945). That line has remained constant.
8
 I agree with the Court
that no “magic words” are necessary to establish valid
consent. Ante, at 12–13, n. 5. But when the statutory
scheme itself distinguishes between actual “consent”
and registration, §§5301(a)(2)(i), (ii), and when the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court sees a difference between the two, it is
quite a stretch to treat them as one and the same.
9
 Mallory, by contrast,
chooses to rest his case for jurisdiction on registration and
registration alone. Tr. of Oral Arg. 49 (“We’re relying
on consent and consent alone. Without consent, we don’t
prevail”). Apparently dissatisfied with this concession, the
plurality finds its own facts and develops its own argument. That
is not how we usually do things. See United States v.
Sineneng-Smith, 590 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2020)
(slip op., at 3–4).
