GINSBURG, J., DISSENTING
GRUPO DATAFLUX V. ATLAS GLOBAL GROUP, L.&NBSP;P.
541 U. S. ____ (2004)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 02-1689

															GRUPO DATAFLUX, PETITIONER v. ATLAS GLOBAL
GROUP, L. P., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the fifth circuit

															[May 17, 2004]

															   Justice Ginsburg, with whom
Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer join,
dissenting.

															   When this lawsuit was filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas
in 1997, diversity of citizenship was incomplete among the adverse
parties: The plaintiff partnership, Atlas Global Group (Atlas), had
five members, including a general partner of Delaware citizenship
and two limited partners of Mexican citizenship, App. 98a; the
defendant, Grupo Dataflux (Dataflux), was a Mexican corporation
with its principal place of business in Mexico, id., at
18a. In a transaction completed in September 2000 unrelated to this
lawsuit, all Mexican-citizen partners withdrew from Atlas.
Id., at 98a, 122a–123a. Thus, before trial commenced
in October 2000, complete diversity existed. Only after the jury
returned a verdict favorable to Atlas did Dataflux, by moving to
dismiss the case, draw the initial jurisdictional flaw to the
District Court’s attention. The Court today holds that the
initial flaw “still burden[s] and run[s] with the
case,” Caterpillar Inc. v.
Lewis, 519 U.
S. 61, 70 (1996); see ante, at 6–10;
consequently, the entire trial and jury verdict must be nullified.
In my view, the initial defect here—the original absence of
complete diversity—“is not fatal to the ensuing
adjudication.” Caterpillar, 519 U. S., at 64. In
accord with the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, I would
leave intact the results of the six-day trial between completely
diverse citizens, and would not expose Atlas and the courts to the
“exorbitant cost” of relitigation, id., at
77.

															I

															   Chief Justice Marshall, in a
pathmarking 1824 opinion, Mollan v. Torrance, 9
Wheat. 537, 539, instructed “that the jurisdiction of the
Court depends upon the state of things at the time of the action
brought, and that after vesting, it cannot be ousted by subsequent
events.” He did not extract this practical time-of-filing
rule from any constitutional or statutory text. In contrast, 18
years earlier, Marshall had derived the complete-diversity rule
from the text of the 1789 Judiciary Act, and so stated in
Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267 (1806).
Compare State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v.
Tashire, 386 U. S. 523,
530–531 (1967) (complete diversity rule is statutory), with
13B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal
Practice and Procedure §3608, p. 452 (2d ed. 1984)
(time-of-filing rule “represents a policy
decision”).

															   The Court has long applied
Marshall’s time-of-filing rule categorically to post-filing
changes that otherwise would destroy diversity
jurisdiction. See, e.g., Gwaltney of Smithfield,
Ltd. v. Chesapeake Bay Foundation,
Inc., 484
U. S. 49, 69 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment); St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v.
Red Cab Co., 303 U. S. 283,
289–290 (1938); Mollan, 9 Wheat., at 539–540.
I do not question this consistently applied, altogether sensible
refusal to allow a losing party, after summary judgment or an
adverse verdict, to assert that all bets are off on the ground that
jurisdiction, originally present, was thereafter divested.

															   In contrast, the Court has not adhered to a
similarly steady rule for post-filing party line-up alterations
that perfect previously defective statutory subject-matter
jurisdiction. Compare Keene Corp. v. United
States, 508 U. S. 200,
207–208 (1993) (dismissing suit); Minneapolis & St.
Louis R. Co. v. Peoria & Pekin Union R.
Co., 270
U. S. 580, 586 (1926) (same); Anderson v.
Watt, 138 U. S. 694, 707– 708 (1891)
(same), with Caterpillar, 519 U. S., at 64 (not dismissing
suit); Newman-Green, Inc. v.
Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U. S. 826, 837–838 (1989)
(same); Mullaney v. Anderson, 342 U. S. 415,
416–417 (1952) (same); Horn v. Lockhart, 17
Wall. 570, 579 (1873) (same); Conolly v. Taylor,
2 Pet. 556, 565 (1829) (same). Instead, the Court has recognized
that “untimely compliance,” Lexecon Inc. v.
Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U. S. 26, 43 (1998),
with the complete-diversity rule announced in Strawbridge
can operate to preserve an adjudication where (1) neither the
parties nor the court raised the time-of-filing flaw until after
resolution of the case by jury verdict or dispositive court ruling,
and (2) prior to that resolution, the jurisdictional defect was
cured. See Caterpillar, 519 U. S., at 64.

															A

															   To state the background of this
case in fuller detail, in November 1997, respondent Atlas, a
limited partnership, which then included two Mexican-citizen
limited partners and a Delaware-citizen general partner,[Footnote 1] commenced a federal-court
action against Dataflux, a Mexican corporation with its principal
place of business in Mexico. 312 F. 3d 168, 169–170 (CA5
2002); App. 18a–19a, 98a; Brief for Petitioner 3. Seeking
recovery on contract and quantum meruit claims, Atlas
erroneously asserted diversity jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.
§1332(a). 312 F. 3d, at 169– 170; App.
18a–19a.[Footnote 2]
Dataflux’s answer admitted diversity jurisdiction even
though, in fact, complete diversity did not exist given the
altogether evident Mexican citizenship of both Dataflux and two of
Atlas’ limited partners. 312 F. 3d, at 170; App. 35a;
see Carden v. Arkoma Associates, 494 U. S. 185, 195–196 (1990)
(federal court must look to citizenship of partnership’s
limited, as well as its general, partners to determine whether
there is complete diversity). In addition, one of Atlas’
general partners at least arguably ranked as a Mexican citizen. See
supra, at 3–4, n. 1.

															   In September 2000, several weeks
before trial, and unrelated to the claims in suit, Atlas completed
a transaction in which all Mexican-citizen partners withdrew from
the partnership. App. 14a, 122a–123a, 126a–128a; Brief
for Appellants in No. 01–20245 (CA5), p. 7. After that
reorganization, it is not disputed, complete diversity existed
between the adverse parties. Brief for Petitioner 2; Brief for
Respondents 2.

															   Prevailing at a six-day trial, Atlas gained a
jury verdict of $750,000. 312 F. 3d, at 170. Dataflux then
promptly moved to dismiss the action for lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction, raising, for the first time, the original, but
pretrial-cured, absence of complete diversity. App. 42a– 49a.
The District Court, which had not yet entered judgment on the
jury’s verdict, granted Dataflux’s motion;
simultaneously, the court “ordered that the statute of
limitations for the claims alleged in this case [be] stayed from
November 18, 1997, the date this case was filed, until ten days
after the entry of this order [December 6, 2000], to allow
plaintiff to refile this case in the appropriate forum.” App.
to Pet. for Cert. 20a–22a (capitalization in original
omitted). The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the
District Court’s judgment and remanded the case to that
court. 312 F. 3d, at 173–174. Viewing Newman-Green,
Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U. S. 826 (1989), as
“instructive,” and Caterpillar Inc. v.
Lewis, 519 U.
S. 61 (1996), as “compel[ling],” the Court of
Appeals found it unnecessary and inappropriate to “erase the
result of [the trial and verdict] by requiring [the parties] to
relitigate their claims.” 312 F. 3d, at
171–174.

															   Caterpillar and Newman-Green
are indeed the decisions most closely on point. In
Caterpillar, plaintiff Lewis, a Kentucky citizen, filed a
civil action in state court against two corporate
defendants—Caterpillar Inc., a citizen of both Delaware and
Illinois, and Whayne Supply Company, a Kentucky citizen. 519 U. S.,
at 64–65. Several months later, Liberty Mutual, a
Massachusetts corporation, intervened as a plaintiff, asserting
claims against both defendants. Id., at 65. After Lewis
settled with Whayne Supply, Caterpillar filed a notice of removal.
Ibid. Lewis moved to remand the case to the state court on
the ground that Liberty Mutual had not settled its claim against
Whayne Supply, and that Whayne Supply’s continuing presence
as a defendant in the lawsuit defeated complete diversity.
Id., at 65–66. The District Court denied
Lewis’ motion to remand. Id., at 66. Liberty Mutual
and Whayne Supply subsequently settled, and the District Court
dismissed Whayne Supply from the suit. Ibid.

															   The case proceeded to a jury trial, which
yielded a verdict and corresponding judgment for Caterpillar.
Id., at 66–67. On appeal to the Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit, Lewis prevailed. Id., at 67. Observing
that, at the time of removal, diversity was incomplete, the
appellate court accepted Lewis’ argument that dismissal of
the case for want of subject-matter jurisdiction was obligatory.
Ibid. In turn, this Court reversed the Court of
Appeals’ judgment: “[A] district court’s error in
failing to remand a case improperly removed,” this Court held
unanimously, “is not fatal to the ensuing adjudication if
federal jurisdictional requirements are met at the time judgment is
entered.” Id., at 64.

															   Newman-Green concerned a state-law
action filed in Federal District Court by an Illinois corporation
against a Venezuelan corporation, four Venezuelan citizens, and a
United States citizen domiciled in Venezuela. 490 U. S., at 828.
After the District Court granted partial summary judgment for the
defendants, the plaintiff appealed. Ibid. SU.
S.onte, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit inquired
into the basis for federal jurisdiction over the case, and
concluded that the presence of the Venezuela-domiciled United
States citizen spoiled complete diversity. Id., at
828–829.[Footnote 3] To
cure the defect, the three-judge panel granted the
plaintiff’s motion to drop the nondiverse party, citing
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21. Newman-Green, 490 U.
S., at 829.[Footnote 4] But the
full Circuit Court, empaneled en banc, concluded that an appellate
court lacks such authority. Id., at 830–831. This
Court reversed that determination. Federal appellate courts, the
Court held, “posses[s] the authority to grant motions to
dismiss dispensable nondiverse parties.” Id., at
836.[Footnote 5]

															   As in Caterpillar and
Newman-Green, minimal diversity within Article III’s
compass existed in this case from the start. See U. S. Const., Art.
III, §2, cl. 1 (“The judicial Power shall extend to
all Cases … between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and
foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.”); State Farm Fire
& Casualty Co., 386 U. S., at 531 (“Article III
poses no obstacle to the legislative extension of federal
jurisdiction, founded on diversity, so long as any two adverse
parties are not co-citizens.”). The jurisdictional
flaw—in Caterpillar, Newman-Green, and this
case—was the absence of complete diversity, required by the
governing statute, §1332(a), when the action commenced, a flaw
eliminated at a later stage of the proceedings. Cf. ante,
at 6–7 (describing Caterpillar and
Newman-Green as cases in which “the
less-than-complete diversity which had subsisted throughout the
action had been converted to complete diversity between the
remaining parties to the final judgment”).

															   It bears clarification why this case, in
common with Caterpillar and Newman-Green, met the
constitutional requirement of minimal diversity at the onset of the
litigation. True, Atlas’ case involves a partnership, while
the diversity spoiler in Caterpillar was a corporation and
in Newman-Green, an individual. See supra, at
5–7. In Carden v. Arkoma Associates, this
Court held that, in determining a partnership’s qualification
to sue or be sued under §1332, the citizenship of each
partner, whether general or limited, must be attributed to the
partnership. See 494 U. S., at 195–196.

															   Notably, however, the Court did not suggest in
Carden that minimal diversity, which is adequate for
Article III purposes, would be absent when some, but not all,
partners composing the “single artificial entity,”
id., at 188, n. 1, share the opposing party’s
citizenship. To the contrary, the Court emphasized in
Carden that Congress could, “by legislation,”
determine which of the “wide assortment of artificial
entities possessing different powers and characteristics …
is entitled to be considered a ‘citizen’ for diversity
purposes, and which of their members’ citizenship is to be
consulted.” Id., at 197. Congress would be disarmed
from making such determinations—for example, from legislating
that only the citizenship of general partners counts for §1332
purposes—if Article III itself commanded that each
partner’s citizenship, limited and general partner’s
alike, inescapably adheres to the partnership entity. See
ibid.; cf. Steelworkers v. R. H.
Bouligny, Inc., 382 U. S. 145, 153
(1965) (assimilating unincorporated labor unions to the status of
corporations for diversity purposes, instead of counting each
member’s citizenship, is a matter “suited to the
legislative and not the judicial branch”). Just as Article
III did not dictate the Carden decision, so the question
here is plainly subconstitutional in character.

															B

															   Petitioner Dataflux maintains,
and the Court agrees, see ante, at 6–7, that this
case is not properly bracketed with Caterpillar, where the
subtraction of a party yielded complete diversity; instead,
according to Dataflux, this case should be aligned with those in
which an individual plaintiff initially shared citizenship with a
defendant, and then, post-commencement of the litigation, moved to
another State. See Brief for Petitioner 12–14, and n. 9,
23–24; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8–11. In my view, this case
ranks with Caterpillar and is not equivalent to the case
of a plaintiff who moves to another State to create diversity not
even minimally present when the complaint was filed.

															   It has long been clear that
“if a citizen sue[d] a citizen of the same state, he [could
not] give jurisdiction by removing himself, and becoming a citizen
of a different state.” Conolly, 2 Pet., at
565.[Footnote 6] When that sole
plaintiff files suit in federal court, there is no semblance of
Article III diversity; his move to another State manufactures
diversity of citizenship that did not exist even minimally at the
outset. Caterpillar and Newman-Green, by
contrast, involved parties who were minimally, but not completely,
diverse at the time federal-court proceedings began.
Caterpillar, 519 U. S., at 64–65;
Newman-Green, 490 U. S., at 828; supra, at
5–7. The post-commencement party line-up changes in
Caterpillar and Newman-Green simply trimmed the
litigation down to an ever present core that met the statutory
requirement.[Footnote 7]

															   The same holds true for Atlas. No partner
moved. Instead, those that spoiled statutory diversity dropped out
of the case as did the nondiverse parties in Caterpillar
and Newman-Green. See supra, at 5–7. In
essence, then, this case seems to me indistinguishable from one in
which there is “a change in the parties to the action.”
Ante, at 8.[Footnote
8] As the Court correctly states, the crux of our disagreement
lies in whether to “treat a change in the composition of a
partnership like a change in the parties to the action.”
Ante, at 11–12. In common with Dataflux, the Court
draws no distinction between an individual plaintiff who changes
her citizenship and an enterprise composed of diverse persons, like
Atlas, from which one or more original members exit. See
ante, at 8 (“The purported cure [in this case] arose
not from a change in the parties to the action, but from a change
in the citizenship of a continuing party.”). Resisting that
far-from-inevitable alignment, I would bracket the multimember
enterprise with partially changed membership together with
multiparty litigation from which some of the originally joined
parties drop. I would do so on the ground that in procedural
rulings generally, even on questions of a court’s
adjudicatory authority in particular, salvage operations are
ordinarily preferable to the wrecking ball.

															C

															   Petitioner Dataflux sees
Caterpillar as a ruling limited to removal cases, and
Newman-Green as limited to court-ordered dismissals of
nondiverse parties. See 312 F. 3d, at 173–174; Brief for
Petitioner 23, 26–27; Reply Brief for Petitioner 11; Tr. of
Oral Arg. 15–16. True, the court’s attention may be
attracted to the jurisdictional question by a motion to remand a
removed case or a motion to drop a party. But, as the Fifth Circuit
observed, “the principle of these cases is [not] limited to
only the exact same procedural scenarios.” 312 F. 3d, at
173. It would be odd, indeed, to hold, as Dataflux’s argument
suggests, that jurisdictional flaws fatal to original jurisdiction
are nonetheless tolerable when removal jurisdiction is exercised.
Removal jurisdiction, after all, is totally dependent on
satisfaction of the requirements for original jurisdiction. See 28
U. S. C. §1441(a) (“any civil action brought in a
State court of which the district courts of the United States have
original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the
defendants, to [a] district court of the United States”). The
“considerations of finality, efficiency, and economy”
central to the Caterpillar Court’s treatment of a
failure to satisfy “the [complete diversity] requirement of
the removal statute, 28 U. S. C. §1441(a),”
ante, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted), have equal
force in appraising the “statutory defect”
here, ibid. (emphasis in original), i.e.,
Atlas’ failure initially to satisfy the complete-diversity
requirement of §1332(a).

															   Moreover, by whatever route a
case arrives in federal court, it is the obligation of both
district court and counsel to be alert to jurisdictional
requirements. See, e.g., Bender v.
Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U. S. 534, 541
(1986) (“every federal appellate court has a special
obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but
also that of the lower courts in a cause under review, even though
the parties are prepared to concede it” (quoting
Mitchell v. Maurer, 293 U. S. 237, 244
(1934))); United Republic Ins. Co. in Receivership v.
Chase Manhattan Bank, 315 F.3d 168, 170–171 (CA2
2003) (“We have … urged counsel and district courts to
treat subject matter jurisdiction as a threshold issue for
resolution … .”); United States v.
Southern California Edison Co., 300 F. Supp. 2d 964,
972 (ED Cal. 2004) (district courts have an “independent
obligation to address [subject-matter jurisdiction] sU.
S.onte” (internal quotation marks omitted));
Trawick v. Asbury MS Gray-Daniels, LLC, 244
F. Supp. 2d 697, 699 (SD Miss. 2003) (criticizing counsel for
failing to do the “minimal amount of research” that
would have revealed the absence of subject-matter jurisdiction).
But cf. ante, at 13 (time-of-filing rule should be rigidly
applied when “no judicial action … was necessary to
get the jurisdictional spoilers out of the case”). That
obligation is equally applicable to cases initially filed in
federal court and cases removed from state court to federal
court.

															   In short, the Fifth Circuit correctly
comprehended the essential teaching of Caterpillar and
Newman-Green: The generally applicable time-of-filing rule
is displaced when (1) a “jurisdictional requiremen[t] [is]
not met, (2) neither the parties nor the judge raise the error
until after a jury verdict has been rendered, or a dispositive
ruling [typically, a grant of summary judgment] has been made by
the court, and (3) before the verdict is rendered, or [the
dispositive] ruling is issued, the jurisdictional defect is
cured.” 312 F. 3d, at 174.[Footnote 9]

															D

															   The
“considerations of finality, efficiency, and economy”
the Court found “overwhelming” in Caterpillar
and Newman-Green have undiluted application here.
Caterpillar, 519 U. S., at 75; see Newman-Green,
490 U. S., at 836–837. See also Friends of Earth,
Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,
528 U. S. 167, 191–192 (2000)
(noting stricter approach to standing than to mootness in view of
“sunk costs” once a “case has been brought and
litigated”). In Newman-Green, this Court observed
that rigid insistence on the time-of-filing rule, rather than
allowing elimination of the jurisdictional defect by dropping a
dispensable party, would mean an almost certain replay of the case,
with, in all likelihood, the same ultimate outcome. 490 U. S., at
837.[Footnote 10] Similarly
here, given the October 2000 jury verdict of $750,000 and the
unquestioned current existence of complete diversity, Atlas can be
expected “simply [to] refile in the District Court” and
rerun the proceedings. See ibid.[Footnote 11] No legislative prescription, nothing
other than this Court’s readiness to cut loose a court-made
rule from common sense, accounts for waste of this large
order.
   The Court
hypothesizes that Atlas and Dataflux will now settle to avoid fresh
litigation costs. Ante, at 15. The majority’s
forecast, however, ignores the procedural history of this case.
Knowing full well the first jury verdict, the parties on two
occasions missed clear opportunities to settle: after the District
Court’s dismissal and after the Court of Appeals’
reversal. Instead, the parties “waste[d] time and
resources,” including 31/2
years on a jurisdictional question. Ante, at 15–16.
Even with the jurisdictional question resolved in its favor,
Dataflux would now weigh against settlement the possibility that a
new panel of jurors, and tactical knowledge gleaned from the first
trial, could yield a different outcome the second time around.
Atlas, too, might decline to settle: It prevailed once in a jury
trial, and committed 61/2 years to
litigation, see ante, at 16, a cost that is rational to
ignore, but, in practice, hard to sideline. In short, settlement,
which depends on the parties’ shared estimate of likely
litigation outcomes, is hardly
guaranteed.
   In two respects, there is
stronger cause for departure from the time-of-filing rule in
Atlas’ case than there was in Caterpillar. See
supra, at 5–6 (discussing Caterpillar).
First, the Caterpillar plaintiff, judgment loser in the
federal trial court, had timely but fruitlessly objected to the
defendant’s improper removal. 519 U. S., at 74. The plaintiff
in Caterpillar, this Court acknowledged, had done
“all that was required to preserve his objection to
removal.” Ibid. Though mindful of the
“antecedent statutory violatio[n],” the Court declined
to disturb the District Court’s final judgment on the merits.
Id., at 74–75. The defendant in this case, Dataflux,
in seeking to erase the trial and verdict here, resembles the
plaintiff in Caterpillar, except that Dataflux raised its
subject-matter jurisdiction objection only after the
parties had become completely diverse. Cf. 312 F. 3d, at 170.
It is one thing to preserve jurisdictional objections so long as
the jurisdictional flaw persists, see Kontrick v.
Ryan, 540 U. S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 11);
Capron v. Van Noorden, 2 Cranch 126 (1804)),
quite another to tolerate such an objection after the initial flaw
has disappeared from the
case.
   The Court sustains these
outcomes: The Caterpillar plaintiff, whose prompt
resistance to removal would generally have garnered a remand to the
state forum plaintiff had originally selected, is nevertheless
bound to an adverse federal-court judgment; the defendant, Dataflux
here, after incorrectly conceding federal subject-matter
jurisdiction in its answer, see App. 35a, and leaving the record
uncorrected until the jury favored the plaintiff, is allowed to
return to square one, unburdened by the adverse judgment. There is
no little irony in that juxtaposition, all the more so given the
absence of any charge of manipulation in this
case.
   Nor would affirmance of the
Fifth Circuit judgment entail a significant risk of manipulation in
other cases. Rarely, if ever, will a plaintiff bring suit in
federal district court, invoking diversity jurisdiction under
§1332(a), with the knowledge that complete diversity does not
exist, but in the hope of a post-filing jurisdiction-perfecting
event. Such a plaintiff’s anticipation is likely to be
thwarted by the court’s or the defendant’s swift
detection of the jurisdictional impediment. Furthermore, a
plaintiff who ignores threshold jurisdictional requirements risks
sanctions and “the displeasure of a district court whose
authority has been improperly invoked.” Caterpillar,
519 U. S., at 77–78. The Court’s fears about the
“litigation-fostering effect” of exceptions to the
time-of-filing rule, ante, at 14, thus appear more
imaginary than real. No wave of new jurisdictional litigation is
likely, as the federal courts’ experience after
Caterpillar and Newman-Green
shows.
   Also distinguishing the two
cases, in Caterpillar, the removing defendant
“satisfied with only a day to spare the statutory requirement
that a diversity-based removal take place within one year of a
lawsuit’s commencement.” Id., at 65 (citing 28
U. S. C. §1446(b)). Had that defendant remained in state
court pending the settlement that left only completely diverse
parties in the litigation, the one-year limitation on removal would
have barred the way to federal court. Nothing in the record or
briefing here, however, suggests that Atlas filed precipitously in
federal court in the hope of outpacing a fast-running limitations
period; on the contrary, Atlas’ complaint rested on events
that occurred only ten months prior to the commencement of the
action, see App. 18a, 22a–23a, and therefore fell comfortably
within any applicable time bar.[Footnote 12] This case thus presents no risk that refusal
to treat an initial jurisdictional flaw as determinative will
de facto extend a limitations period. Cf. 13B Wright,
Miller, & Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3608,
p. 459.
   In sum, the Court’s
judgment effectively returns this case for relitigation in the very
same District Court in which it was first filed in 1997. Having
lost once, Dataflux now gets an unmerited second chance, never mind
“just how much time will be lost along the way.”
Newman-Green, 490 U. S., at 837, n. 12 (internal
quotation marks omitted). Nothing is gained by burdening our
district courts with the task of replaying diversity actions of
this kind once they have been fully and fairly tried. Neither the
Constitution nor federal statute demands a time-of-filing rule as
rigid as the one the Court today
installs.
   The Court invokes “175
years” of precedent, ante, at 8–9, endorsing a
time-of-filing rule that, generally, is altogether sound. On that
point, the Court is united. See supra, at 2–3. For
the class of cases over which we divide—cases involving a
post-filing change in the composition of a multimember association
such as a partnership— the Court presents no authority
impelling the waste today’s judgment approves. Even if
precedent could provide a basis for the Court’s disposition,
rules fashioned by this Court for “the just, speedy, and
inexpensive determination [of cases],” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
1, should not become immutable at the instant of their initial
articulation. Rather, they should remain adjustable in light of
experience courts constantly gain in handling the cases that troop
before them. See Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v.
Knudson, 534 U. S. 204, 233
(2002) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Grupo Mexicano de
Desarrollo, S. A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc.,
527 U. S. 308,
336–337, and n. 4 (1999) (Ginsburg, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part) (recognizing, in line with
contemporary English decisions, dynamic quality of equity
jurisprudence in response to evolving social and commercial needs).
I would affirm the judgment of the Fifth Circuit, which faithfully
and sensibly followed the path the Court marked in
Newman-Green and
Caterpillar.

 At the time of filing,
Atlas comprised (1) general partner Bahia Management,
L. L. C., a Texas limited liability company (LLC), which
included Mexican-citizen members; (2) general partner Capital
Financial Partner, Inc., a Delaware corporation; (3) limited
partner HIL Financial Holdings, L. P., a limited partnership
with Texas and Delaware citizenship; (4) limited partner Francisco
Llamosa, a Mexican citizen; and (5) limited partner Oscar Robles,
another Mexican citizen. Brief for Petitioner 3; App. 98a. At least
arguably, the general partner Bahia Management, like the two
limited partners of Mexican citizenship, initially spoiled
diversity. Although the Court has never ruled on the issue, Courts
of Appeals have held the citizenship of each member of an LLC
counts for diversity purposes. See, e.g., GMAC
Commercial Credit LLC v. Dillard Dept. Stores, 357
F. 3d 827, 829 (CA8 2004); Cosgrove v.
Bartolotta, 150 F. 3d 729, 731 (CA7 1998). Bahia
withdrew from Atlas at the same time as the two Mexican-citizen
limited partners withdrew. App.
98a.

 Section 1332(a)
provides:
   “(a) The district
courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where
the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000,
exclusive of interest and costs, and is
between—
   “(1) citizens of
different States;
   “(2) citizens of a
State and citizens or subjects of a foreign
state;
   “(3) citizens of
different States and in which citizens or subjects of a foreign
state are additional parties;
and
   “(4) a foreign state,
defined in section 1603(a) of this title, as plaintiff and citizens
of a State or of different
States.
“For the purposes of this section,
section 1335, and section 1441, an alien admitted to the United
States for permanent residence shall be deemed a citizen of the
State in which such alien is
domiciled.”
Footnote

 A United States citizen
with no domicil in any State ranks as a stateless person for
purposes of 28 U. S. C. §1332(a)(3), providing for suits
between “citizens of different States and in which citizens
or subjects of a foreign state are additional parties,” and
§1332(a)(2), authorizing federal suit when “citizens of
a State” sue “citizens or subjects of a foreign
state.” See Newman-Green, 490 U. S., at
828.

 Rule 21, governing
proceedings in district courts, provides in relevant part:
“Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on
motion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the
action and on such terms as are
just.”

 After our decision, the
Seventh Circuit dismissed the nondiverse defendant and remanded the
case to the District Court. Newman-Green, Inc. v.
Alfonzo-Larrain, 734 F. Supp. 1470, 1472 (ND Ill.
1990).

 In Conolly, a
party “was struck out of the bill before the cause was
brought before the court.” 2 Pet., at 564. Since
Conolly, the Court has addressed the time-of-filing rule
in a variety of cases in which the party line-up changed during the
pendency of the litigation. See supra, at 3;
ante, at 8, n. 5. The Court, however, has not
previously ruled on a case resembling the controversy at hand,
i.e., one involving an association whose citizenship, for
diversity purposes, is determined by aggregating the citizenships
of each of its members. With equal plausibility, such an
association could be characterized as an “aggregation”
composed of its members, or an “entity” comprising its
members.
Footnote

 Anderson v.
Watt, 138 U. S. 694 (1891), see
ante, at 4–5, is not altogether in tune with
Caterpillar and Newman-Green. In
Anderson, coexecutors sued for the benefit of an estate.
138 U. S., at 703. One of the coexecutors, it turned out, shared
common citizenship with two of the defendants. To salvage the
adjudication, the nondiverse coexecutor sought to withdraw both as
executor and as plaintiff, but the Court declined to give effect to
the post-filing change in the party line-up. Id., at 708.
The Court would harmonize Anderson with
Caterpillar and Newman-Green by attributing
entity, rather than aggregate, status to the Anderson
coexecutors. Ante, at 5, n. 3. But that
characterization is hardly preordained. If, as it seems to me,
either characterization would be plausible, Caterpillar
and Newman-Green suggest that the one preserving the
adjudication ought to hold
sway.
Footnote

 While a partnership may
be characterized as a “single artificial entity,”
Carden v. Arkoma Associates, 494 U. S. 185, 188, n. 1 (1990),
a district court determining whether diversity jurisdiction exists
looks “to the citizenship of the several persons composing
[the entity],” Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co.
v. Jones, 177 U. S. 449, 456
(1900). I.e., the district court looks to the citizenship
of each general and limited partner, just as in multiparty
litigation the court looks to the citizenship of each litigant
joined on the same side. See supra, at
4.
Footnote
9
 According to the
majority, it would be “unsound in principle and certain to be
ignored in practice” to decline to apply the time-of-filing
rule only in those cases where the flaw is drawn to a court’s
attention after a full adjudication of the case, whether through
trial or by a dispositive court ruling. Ante, at
9–10. Declining to apply the time-of-filing rule only in
those cases, the Court suggests, can be justified only on the
theory that “the party who failed to object before the end of
trial [or dispositive court ruling] forfeited his objection.”
Ibid. (citing Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.
S. ___, ___ (2004) (slip op., at 11)). The time-of-filing rule,
however, is a court-created rule, see supra, at 2; it is
therefore incumbent on the Court to define the contours of that
rule’s application. The Fifth Circuit’s decision rested
not on a forfeiture theory; rather, the decision accurately
reflected the judicial economy underpinnings of the time-of-filing
rule. True, as the Court observes, judicial economy concerns might
be pressing even when a case is not fully adjudicated through trial
or summary pretrial disposition. See ante, at 10. When a
district court has so fully adjudicated the case, however, there
can be no doubt that the “sunk costs to the judicial
system,” Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw
Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 192, n. 5 (2000),
have become “overwhelming,” Caterpillar Inc.
v. Lewis, 519 U.
S. 61, 75 (1996). That the rule advanced by the Court of
Appeals is underinclusive does not make it
“illogic[al],” ante, at 9; instead, the
limitation makes the rule readily manageable. To hold the
time-of-filing rule developed by this Court inapplicable here
merely abjures mechanical extension of the rule in favor of
responding sensibly to the rule’s underlying justifications
when those justifications are indisputably
present.

 In stark contrast to
today’s decision, see ante, at 14–16, the
Newman-Green Court said: “If the entire suit were
dismissed, Newman-Green would simply refile in the District Court
… and submit the discovery materials already in
hand… . Newman-Green should not be compelled to jump
through [such] judicial hoops merely for the sake of hypertechnical
jurisdictional purity.” 490 U. S., at
837.

 The statute of
limitations is unlikely to bar the repeat performance given the
representation of counsel for both Atlas and Dataflux that “a
[Texas] savings statute, assuming Texas law applies, … would
allow Atlas to refile suit.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 22; see
id., at 31. See also App. to Pet. for Cert. 22a (District
Court order staying “the statute of limitations for the
claims alleged in this case”); supra, at 5. Although
counsel did not provide a citation to the Texas saving statute, I
note a provision of that State’s law, Tex. Civ. Prac. &
Rem. Code Ann. §16.064 (1997), covering cases originally filed
in the wrong forum: “The period between the date of filing an
action in a trial court and the date of a second filing of the same
action in a different court suspends the running of the applicable
statute of limitations for the period if” the first action is
dismissed for “lack of jurisdiction.” This
prescription, described as “remedial in nature,” has
been “liberally construed.” Vale v.
Ryan, 809 S. W. 2d 324, 326 (Tex. App. 1991). Counsel
for both Atlas and Dataflux also suggested New York law may apply.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22, 31. New York has a saving provision that
appears to allow refiling just as Texas law would. See N. Y.
Civ. Prac. Law §205(a) (West 2003) (“If an action is
timely commenced and is terminated,” e.g., for lack
of jurisdiction, “the plaintiff … may commence a new
action … within six months
… .”).
Footnote
12
 At oral argument,
counsel for Atlas and Dataflux indicated that either New York or
Texas law would supply the governing limitations period. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 22, 31. The Texas limitations period for contract and
quantum meruit actions is four years. See W. W.
Laubach Trust/The Georgetown Corp. v. The Georgetown
Corp./W. W. Laubach Trust, 80 S. W. 3d 149, 160
(Tex. App. 2002) (“Breach of contract claims are generally
governed by a four year statute of limitations.” (citing Tex.
Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. §16.004 (1986)));
Mann v. Jack Roach Bissonnet, Inc., 623
S. W. 2d 716, 718 (Tex. Civ. App. 1981) (“[The] suit to
recover on quantum meruit … is a species of a suit for
debt,” subject to the limitations period for debt actions
contained in §16.004.). New York allows six years for contract
and quantum meruit actions. See In re R. M.
Kliment & Frances Halsband, Architects, 3 App. Div. 3d
143, 147, 770 N.Y.S.2d 329, 332 (1st Dept., 2004) (“Breach of contract actions are subject generally to a
six-year statute of limitations.” (internal quotation marks
omitted)); Eisen v. Feder, 307 App. Div. 2d 817,
818, 763 N. Y. S. 2d 279, 280 (1st Dept., 2003) (a
six-year statute of limitations applies to quantum meruit
actions, citing N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law §213.2 (West
2003)).
