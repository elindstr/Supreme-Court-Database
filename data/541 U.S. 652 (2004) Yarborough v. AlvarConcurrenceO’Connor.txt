SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 02-1684

															MICHAEL YARBOROUGH, WARDEN, PETITIONER v.
MICHAEL ALVARADO

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 1, 2004]

															   Justice O’Connor,
concurring.

															   I join the opinion of the Court,
but write separately to express an additional reason for reversal.
There may be cases in which a suspect’s age will be relevant
to the Miranda “custody” inquiry. In this
case, however, Alvarado was almost 18 years old at the time of his
interview. It is difficult to expect police to recognize that a
suspect is a juvenile when he is so close to the age of majority.
Even when police do know a suspect’s age, it may be difficult
for them to ascertain what bearing it has on the likelihood that
the suspect would feel free to leave. That is especially true here;
17½-year-olds vary widely in their reactions to police
questioning, and many can be expected to behave as adults. Given
these difficulties, I agree that the state court’s decision
in this case cannot be called an unreasonable application of
federal law simply because it failed explicitly to mention
Alvarado’s age.
