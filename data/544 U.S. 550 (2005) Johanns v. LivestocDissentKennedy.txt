															MIKE JOHANNS, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE,
et al., PETITIONERS

															03–1164   v.
LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSOCIATION
et al.
NEBRASKA CATTLEMEN, INC., et al.,
PETITIONERS

															03–1165   v.
LIVESTOCK MARKETING ASSOCIATION
et al.
on writs of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eighth circuit
[May 23, 2005]
   Justice Kennedy,
dissenting.

															   I join Justice Souter’s
dissenting opinion, which demonstrates with persuasive analysis why
the speech at issue here cannot meaningfully be considered
government speech at all. I would reserve for another day the
difficult First Amendment questions that would arise if the
government were to target a discrete group of citizens to pay even
for speech that the government does “embrace as publicly as
it speaks,” post, at 11.
