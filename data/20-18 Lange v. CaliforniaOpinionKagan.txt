															ARTHUR GREGORY LANGE, PETITIONER v. CALIFORNIA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of california, first appellate district

															[June 23, 2021]

															

															Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The
 
Fourth Amendment ordinarily requires that police officers get a warrant before entering a home without permission.  But an officer may make a warrantless entry when “the exigencies of the situation” create a compelling law enforcement need.  Kentucky v. King,

563 U.S. 452, 460 (2011).  The question presented here is whether the pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanor suspect always—or more legally put, categorically—qualifies as an exigent circumstance.  We hold it does not.  A great many misdemeanor pursuits involve exigencies allowing warrantless entry.  But whether a given one does so turns on the particular facts of the case.

															I

															This case began when petitioner Arthur Lange drove past a California highway patrol officer in Sonoma.  Lange, it is fair to say, was asking for attention: He was listening to loud music with his windows down and repeatedly honking his horn.  The officer began to tail Lange, and soon afterward turned on his overhead lights to signal that Lange should pull over.  By that time, though, Lange was only about a hundred feet (some four-seconds drive) from his home.  Rather than stopping, Lange continued to his driveway and entered his attached garage.  The officer followed Lange in and began questioning him.  Observing signs of intoxication, the officer put Lange through field sobriety tests.  Lange did not do well, and a later blood test showed that his blood-alcohol content was more than three times the legal limit.

															The State charged Lange with the misdemeanor of driving under the influence of alcohol, plus a (lower-level) noise infraction.  Lange moved to suppress all evidence obtained after the officer entered his garage, arguing that the warrantless entry had violated the
 
Fourth Amendment.  The State contested the motion.  It contended that the officer had probable cause to arrest Lange for the misdemeanor of failing to comply with a police signal.  See, e.g., Cal. Veh. Code Ann. §2800(a) (West 2015) (making it a misdemeanor to “willfully fail or refuse to comply with a lawful order, signal, or direction of a peace officer”).  And it argued that the pursuit of a suspected misdemeanant always qualifies as an exigent circumstance authorizing a warrantless home entry.  The Superior Court denied Lange’s motion, and its appellate division affirmed.

															The California Court of Appeal also affirmed, accepting the State’s argument in full.  2019 WL 5654385, *1 (2019).  In the court’s view, Lange’s “fail[ure] to immediately pull over” when the officer flashed his lights created probable cause to arrest him for a misdemeanor.  Id., at *7.  And a misdemeanor suspect, the court stated, could “not defeat an arrest which has been set in motion in a public place” by “retreat[ing] into” a house or other “private place.”  See id., at *6–*8 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Rather, an “officer’s ‘hot pursuit’ into the house to prevent the suspect from frustrating the arrest” is always permissible under the exigent-circumstances “exception to the warrant requirement.”  Id., at *8 (some internal quotation marks omitted).  That flat rule resolved the matter: “Because the officer was in hot pursuit” of a misdemeanor suspect, “the officer’s warrantless entry into [the suspect’s] driveway and garage [was] lawful.”  Id., at *9.  The California Supreme Court denied review.

															Courts are divided over whether the
 
Fourth Amendment always permits an officer to enter a home without a warrant in pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanor suspect.  Some courts have adopted such a categorical rule, while others have required a case-specific showing of exigency.[1]  We granted certiorari, 592 U. S. ___ (2020), to resolve the conflict.  Because California abandoned its defense of the categorical rule applied below in its response to Lange’s petition, we appointed Amanda Rice as amicus curiae to defend the Court of Appeal’s judgment.  She has ably discharged her responsibilities.

															II

															The
 
Fourth Amendment provides that “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.”  As that text makes clear, “the ultimate touchstone of the
 
Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness.’ ”  Brigham City v. Stuart,

547 U.S. 398, 403 (2006).  That standard “generally requires the obtaining of a judicial warrant” before a law enforcement officer can enter a home without permission.  Riley v. California,

573 U.S. 373, 382 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But not always: The “warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.”  Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403.

															One important exception is for exigent circumstances.  It applies when “the exigencies of the situation make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable.”  King, 563 U. S., at 460 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The exception enables law enforcement officers to handle “emergenc[ies]”—situations presenting a “compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.”  Riley, 573 U. S., at 402; Missouri v. McNeely,

569 U.S. 141, 149 (2013).  Over the years, this Court has identified several such exigencies.  An officer, for example, may “enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant[,] to protect an occupant from imminent injury,” or to ensure his own safety.  Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403; Riley, 573 U. S., at 388.  So too, the police may make a warrantless entry to “prevent the imminent destruction of evidence” or to “prevent a suspect’s escape.”  Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403; Minnesota v. Olson,

495 U.S. 91, 100 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In those circumstances, the delay required to obtain a warrant would bring about “some real immediate and serious consequences”—and so the absence of a warrant is excused.  Welsh v. Wisconsin,

466 U.S. 740, 751 (1984) (quoting McDonald v. United States,

335 U.S. 451, 460 (1948) (Jackson, J., concurring)).

															Our cases have generally applied the exigent-circumstances exception on a “case-by-case basis.”  Birchfield v. North Dakota,

579 U.S. 438, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 16).  The exception “requires a court to examine whether an emergency justified a warrantless search in each particular case.”  Riley, 573 U. S., at 402.  Or put more curtly, the exception is “case-specific.”  Id., at 388.  That approach reflects the nature of emergencies.  Whether a “now or never situation” actually exists—whether an officer has “no time to secure a warrant”—depends upon facts on the ground.  Id., at 391 (internal quotation marks omitted); McNeely, 569 U. S., at 149 (internal quotation marks omitted).  So the issue, we have thought, is most naturally considered by “look[ing] to the totality of circumstances” confronting the officer as he decides to make a warrantless entry.  Id., at 149.

															The question here is whether to use that approach, or instead apply a categorical warrant exception, when a suspected misdemeanant flees from police into his home.  Under the usual case-specific view, an officer can follow the misdemeanant when, but only when, an exigency—for example, the need to prevent destruction of evidence—allows insufficient time to get a warrant.  The appointed amicus asks us to replace that case-by-case assessment with a flat (and sweeping) rule finding exigency in every case of misdemeanor pursuit.  In her view, those “entries are categorically reasonable, regardless of whether” any risk of harm (like, again, destruction of evidence) “materializes in a particular case.”  Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 31.  The fact of flight from the officer, she says, is itself enough to justify a warrantless entry.  (The principal concurrence agrees.)  To assess that position, we look (as we often do in
 
Fourth Amendment cases) both to this Court’s precedents and to the common-law practices familiar to the Framers.

															A

															The place to start is with our often-stated view of the constitutional interest at stake: the sanctity of a person’s living space.  “[W]hen it comes to the
 
Fourth Amendment, the home is first among equals.”  Florida v. Jardines,

569 U.S. 1, 6 (2013).  At the Amendment’s “very core,” we have said, “stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable government intrusion.”  Collins v. Virginia, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Or again: “Freedom” in one’s own “dwelling is the archetype of the privacy protection secured by the
 
Fourth Amendment”; conversely, “physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which [it] is directed.”  Payton v. New York,

445 U.S. 573, 585, 587 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Amendment thus “draw[s] a firm line at the entrance to the house.”  Id., at 590.  What lies behind that line is of course not inviolable.  An officer may always enter a home with a proper warrant.  And as just described, exigent circumstances allow even warrantless intrusions.  See ibid.; supra, at 4.  But the contours of that or any other warrant exception permitting home entry are “jealously and carefully drawn,” in keeping with the “centuries-old principle” that the “home is entitled to special protection.”  Georgia v. Randolph,

547 U.S. 103, 109, 115 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Caniglia v. Strom, 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 4) (“[T]his Court has repeatedly declined to expand the scope” of “exceptions to the warrant requirement to permit warrantless entry into the home”).  So we are not eager—more the reverse—to print a new permission slip for entering the home without a warrant.

															The amicus argues, though, that we have already created the rule she advocates.  In United States v. Santana,

427 U.S. 38 (1976), the main case she relies on, police officers drove to Dominga Santana’s house with probable cause to think that Santana was dealing drugs, a felony under the applicable law.  When the officers pulled up, they saw Santana standing in her home’s open doorway, some 15 feet away.  As they got out of the van and yelled “police,” Santana “retreated into [the house’s] vestibule.”  Id., at 40.  The officers followed her in, and discovered heroin.  We upheld the warrantless entry as one involving a police “hot pursuit,” even though the chase “ended almost as soon as it began.”  Id., at 43.  Citing “a realistic expectation that any delay would result in destruction of evidence,” we recognized the officers’ “need to act quickly.”  Id., at 42–43.  But we framed our holding in broader terms: Santana’s “act of retreating into her house,” we stated, could “not defeat an arrest” that had “been set in motion in a public place.”  Ibid.  The amicus takes that statement to support a flat rule permitting warrantless home entry when police officers (with probable cause) are pursuing any suspect—whether a felon or a misdemeanant.  See Brief for Amicus Curiae 11, 26.  For support, she points to a number of later decisions describing Santana in dicta as allowing warrantless home entries when police are “in ‘hot pursuit’ of a fugitive” or “a fleeing suspect.”  E.g., Steagald v. United States,

451 U.S. 204, 221 (1981); King, 563 U. S., at 460.  The concurrence echoes her arguments.

															We disagree with that broad understanding of Santana, as we have suggested before.  In rejecting the amicus’s view, we see no need to consider Lange’s counterargument that Santana did not establish any categorical rule—even one for fleeing felons.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, 25 (contending that Santana is “entirely consistent” with “case-by-case exigency analysis” because the Court “carefully based [its] holding on [the] specific facts” and “circumstances”).  Assuming Santana treated fleeing-felon cases categorically (that is, as always presenting exigent circumstances allowing warrantless entry), see, e.g., Stanton v. Sims,

571 U.S. 3, 8 (2013) (per curiam); McNeely, 569 U. S., at 149; King, 563 U. S., at 450, it still said nothing about fleeing misdemeanants.  We said as much in Stanton, when we approved qualified immunity for an officer who had pursued a suspected misdemeanant into a home.  Describing the same split of authority we took this case to address, we stated that “the law regarding warrantless entry in hot pursuit of a fleeing misdemeanant is not clearly established” (so that the officer could not be held liable for damages).  571 U. S., at 6, 10.  In other words, we found that neither Santana nor any other decision had resolved the matter one way or the other.  And we left things in that unsettled state.  See 571 U. S., at 10.  Santana, we noted, addressed a police pursuit “involv[ing] a felony suspect,” 571 U. S., at 9; whether the same approach governed a misdemeanor chase was an issue for a future case.

															Key to resolving that issue are two facts about misdemeanors: They vary widely, but they may be (in a word) “minor.”  Welsh, 466 U. S., at 750.  In California and elsewhere, misdemeanors run the gamut of seriousness.  As the amicus notes, some involve violence.  California, for example, classifies as misdemeanors various forms of assault.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §241 (West Cum. Supp. 2021); Brief for Amicus Curiae 15a–16a.  And across the country, “many perpetrators of domestic violence are charged with misdemeanors,” despite “the harmfulness of their conduct.”  Voisine v. United States,

579 U.S. 686, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 1).  So “a ‘felon’ is” not always “more dangerous than a misdemeanant.”  Tennessee v. Garner,

471 U.S. 1, 14 (1985).  But calling an offense a misdemeanor usually limits prison time to one year.  See 1 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure §1.8(c) (4th ed. Supp. 2020).  States thus tend to apply that label to less violent and less dangerous crimes.  In California, it is a misdemeanor to litter on a public beach.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §374.7(a) (2020).  And to “negligently cut” a plant “growing upon public land.”  §384a(a)(2), (f ).  And to “willfully disturb[ ] another person by loud and unreasonable noise.”  §415(2).  And (last one) to “artificially color[ ] any live chicks [or] rabbits.”  §599(b).  In forbidding such conduct, California is no outlier.  Most States count as misdemeanors such offenses as traffic violations, public intoxication, and disorderly conduct.  See, e.g., Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §545.413(a), (d) (West 2011) (driving without a seatbelt); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 610, §90/1 (West 2018) (drinking alcohol in a railroad car); Ark. Code Ann. §5–71–207(a)(3), (b) (2016) (using obscene language likely to promote disorder).  So the amicus’s (and concurrence’s) rule would cover lawbreakers of every type, including quite a few hard to think alarming.

															This Court has held that when a minor offense alone is involved, police officers do not usually face the kind of emergency that can justify a warrantless home entry.  In Welsh, officers responded to a call about a drunk driver only to discover he had abandoned his vehicle and walked home.  See 466 U. S., at 742–743.  So no police pursuit was necessary, hot or otherwise.  The officers just went to the driver’s house, entered without a warrant, and arrested him for a “nonjailable” offense.  Ibid.  The State contended that exigent circumstances supported the entry because the driver’s “blood-alcohol level might have dissipated while the police obtained a warrant.”  Id., at 754.  We rejected that argument on the ground that the driver had been charged with only a minor offense.  “[T]he gravity of the underlying offense,” we reasoned, is “an important factor to be considered when determining whether any exigency exists.”  Id., at 753.  “[W]hen only a minor offense has been committed” (again, without any flight), there is reason to question whether a compelling law enforcement need is present; so it is “particularly appropriate” to “hesitat[e] in finding exigent circumstances.”  Id., at 750.  And we concluded: “[A]pplication of the exigent-circumstances exception in the context of a home entry should rarely be sanctioned when there is probable cause to believe that only a minor offense” is involved.  Id., at 753.[2]

															Add a suspect’s flight and the calculus changes—but not enough to justify the amicus’s categorical rule.  We have no doubt that in a great many cases flight creates a need for police to act swiftly.  A suspect may flee, for example, because he is intent on discarding evidence.  Or his flight may show a willingness to flee yet again, while the police await a warrant.  But no evidence suggests that every case of misdemeanor flight poses such dangers.  Recall that misdemeanors can target minor, non-violent conduct.  See supra, at 8–9.  Welsh held that when that is so, officers can probably take the time to get a warrant.  And at times that will be true even when a misdemeanant has forced the police to pursue him (especially given that “pursuit” may cover just a few feet of ground, see supra, at 6).  Those suspected of minor offenses may flee for innocuous reasons and in non-threatening ways.  Consider from the casebooks: the man with a mental disability who, in response to officers asking him about “fidgeting with [a] mailbox,” retreated in “a hurried manner” to his nearby home.  Carroll v. Ellington, 800 F.3d 154, 162 (CA5 2015).  Or the teenager “driving without taillights” who on seeing a police signal “did not stop but drove two blocks to his parents’ house, ran inside, and hid in the bathroom.”  Mascorro v. Billings, 656 F.3d 1198, 1202 (CA10 2011).  In such a case, waiting for a warrant is unlikely to hinder a compelling law enforcement need.  See id., at 1207 (“The risk of flight or escape was somewhere between low and nonexistent[,] there was no evidence which could have potentially been destroyed[,] and there were no officer or public safety concerns”).  Those non-emergency situations may be atypical.  But they reveal the overbreadth—fatal in this context—of the amicus’s (and concurrence’s) rule, which would treat a dangerous offender and the scared teenager the same.  In misdemeanor cases, flight does not always supply the exigency that this Court has demanded for a warrantless home entry.

															Our
 
Fourth Amendment precedents thus point toward assessing case by case the exigencies arising from misdemeanants’ flight.  That approach will in many, if not most, cases allow a warrantless home entry.  When the totality of circumstances shows an emergency—such as imminent harm to others, a threat to the officer himself, destruction of evidence, or escape from the home—the police may act without waiting.  And those circumstances, as described just above, include the flight itself.[3]  But the need to pursue a misdemeanant does not trigger a categorical rule allowing home entry, even absent a law enforcement emergency.  When the nature of the crime, the nature of the flight, and surrounding facts present no such exigency, officers must respect the sanctity of the home—which means that they must get a warrant.

															B

															The common law in place at the Constitution’s founding leads to the same conclusion.  That law, we have many times said, may be “instructive in determining what sorts of searches the Framers of the
 
Fourth Amendment regarded as reasonable.”  E.g., Steagald, 451 U. S., at 217.  And the Framers’ view provides a baseline for our own day: The Amendment “must provide at a minimum the degree of protection it afforded when it was adopted.”  United States v. Jones,

565 U.S. 400, 411 (2012); see Jardines, 569 U. S., at 5.  Sometimes, no doubt, the common law of the time is hard to figure out: The historical record does not reveal a limpid legal rule.  See, e.g., Payton, 445 U. S., at 592–597.  Here, we find it challenging to map every particular of the common law’s treatment of warrantless home entries.  But the evidence is clear on the question before us: The common law did not recognize a categorical rule enabling such an entry in every case of misdemeanor pursuit.

															 Like our modern precedents, the common law afforded the home strong protection from government intrusion.  As this Court once wrote: “The zealous and frequent repetition of the adage that a ‘man’s house is his castle’ made it abundantly clear that both in England and in the Colonies ‘the freedom of one’s house’ was one of the most vital elements of English liberty.”  Id., at 596–597 (footnote omitted); see Semayne’s Case, 5 Co. Rep. 91a, 91b, 77 Eng. Rep. 194, 195 (K. B. 1604) (“[T]he house of every one is as to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defen[s]e against injury and violence, as for his repose” (footnote omitted)); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 288 (1768) (“[E]very man’s house is looked upon by the law to be his castle of defen[s]e and asylum”).[4]  To protect that interest, “prominent law lords, the Court of Common Pleas, the Court of King’s Bench, Parliament,” and leading treatise writers all “c[a]me to embrace” the “understanding” that generally “a warrant must issue” before a government official could enter a house.  Donohue, The Original
 
Fourth Amendment, 83 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1181, 1238–1239 (2016); see Davies, Recovering the Original
 
Fourth Amendment, 98 Mich. L. Rev. 547, 642–646 (1999).  That did not mean the Crown got the message; its officers often asserted power to intrude into any home they pleased—thus adding to the colonists’ list of grievances.  See Steagald, 451 U. S., at 220.  But the law on the books offered a different model: “To enter a man’s house” without a proper warrant, Lord Chief Justice Pratt proclaimed in 1763, is to attack “the liberty of the subject” and “destroy the liberty of the kingdom.”  Huckle v. Money, 2 Wils. K. B. 206, 207, 95 Eng. Rep. 768, 769 (K. B. 1763).  That was the idea behind the
 
Fourth Amendment.

															There was an oft-discussed exception: An officer, according to the day’s treatises, could enter a house to pursue a felon.  The felony category then was a good deal narrower than now.  Many modern felonies were “classified as misdemeanors” at common law, with the felony label mostly reserved for crimes “punishable by death.”  Garner, 471 U. S., at 13–14; see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 98 (1791) (Blackstone).  In addressing those serious crimes, the law “allow[ed of] extremities” to meet “necessity.”  R. Burn, The Justice of the Peace, and Parish Officer 86 (6th ed. 1758).  So if a person suspected “upon probable grounds” of a felony “fly and take house,” Sir Matthew Hale opined, then “the constable may break open the door, tho he have no warrant.”  2 Pleas of the Crown 91–92 (1736) (Hale).  Sergeant William Hawkins set out a more restrictive rule in his widely read treatise.  He wrote that a constable, “with or without a warrant,” could “break open doors” if “pursu[ing]” a person “known to have committed” a felony—but not if the person was only “under a probable suspicion.”  2 Pleas of the Crown 138–139 (1787) (Hawkins).  On the other hand, Sir William Blackstone went broader than Hale.  A constable, he thought, could “break open doors”—no less than “upon a justice’s warrant”—if he had “probable suspicion [to] arrest [a] felon,” even absent flight or pursuit.  Blackstone 292.  The commentators thus differed on the scope of the felony exception to the warrant requirement.  But they agreed on one thing: It was indeed a felony exception.  All their rules applied to felonies as a class, and to no other whole class of crimes.

															In the misdemeanor context, officers had more limited authority to intrude on a fleeing suspect’s home.[5]  Once again, some of the specifics are uncertain, and commentators did not always agree with each other.  But none suggested any kind of all-misdemeanor-flight rule.  Instead, their approval of entry turned on the circumstances.  One set of cases involved what might be called pre-felonies.  Blackstone explained that “break[ing] open doors” was allowable not only “in case of [a] felony” but also in case of “a dangerous wounding whereby [a] felony is likely to ensue.”  Ibid.  In other words, the felony rule extended to crimes that would become felonies if the victims died.  See Hale 94.[6]  Another set of cases involved crimes, mostly violent themselves, liable to provoke felonious acts.  Often called “affrays” or “breaches of the peace,” a typical example was “the fighting of two or more persons” to “the terror of his majesty’s subjects.”  Blackstone 145, 150.[7]  Because that conduct created a “danger of felony”—because when it occurred, “there is likely to be manslaughter or bloodshed committed”—“the constable may break open the doors to keep the peace.”  Hale 90, 95 (emphasis deleted); see Hawkins 139 (blessing a warrantless entry “where those who have made an affray in [the constable’s] presence fly to a house and are immediately pursued”).  Hale also approved a warrantless entry to stop a more mundane form of harm: He (though not other commentators) thought a constable could act to “suppress the disorder” associated with “drinking or noise in a house at an unseasonable time of night.”  Hale 95.  But differences aside, all the commentators focused on the facts of cases: When a suspected misdemeanant, fleeing or otherwise, threatened no harm, the constable had to get a warrant.

															The common law thus does not support a categorical rule allowing warrantless home entry when a misdemeanant flees.  It had a rule of that kind for felonies.  But much as in Welsh centuries later, the common law made distinctions based on “the gravity of the underlying offense.”  466 U. S., at 753.  When it came to misdemeanors, flight alone was not enough.  Whether a constable could make a warrantless entry depended as well on other circumstances suggesting a potential for harm and a need to act promptly.[8]  In that way, the common-law rules (even if sometimes hard to discern with precision) mostly mirror our modern caselaw.  The former too demanded—and often found—a law enforcement exigency before an officer could “break open” a fleeing misdemeanant’s doors.  Blackstone 292.

															III

															The flight of a suspected misdemeanant does not always justify a warrantless entry into a home.  An officer must consider all the circumstances in a pursuit case to determine whether there is a law enforcement emergency.  On many occasions, the officer will have good reason to enter—to prevent imminent harms of violence, destruction of evidence, or escape from the home.  But when the officer has time to get a warrant, he must do so—even though the misdemeanant fled.

															Because the California Court of Appeal applied the categorical rule we reject today, we vacate its judgment and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.

 The concurrence is wrong to say that Welsh applies only to nonjailable offenses, and not to minor crimes that are labeled misdemeanors.  See post, at 12–13 (Roberts, C. J., concurring in judgment).  No less than four times, Welsh framed its holding as applying to “minor offenses” generally.  466 U. S., at 750, 752–753.  (By contrast, the word “nonjailable” does not appear in its legal analysis.)  The decision cited lower court cases prohibiting warrantless home entries when the defendant had committed a misdemeanor.  See id., at 752.  And its essential rationale applies to all minor crimes, however labeled.  As the Court stated (quoting an earlier Justice Jackson opinion): It would “display[ ] a shocking lack of all sense of proportion” to say that “private homes, even quarters in a tenement, may be indiscriminately invaded at the discretion of any suspicious police officer engaged in following up offenses that involve no violence or threats of it.”  Id., at 751 (quoting McDonald v. United States,

335 U.S. 451, 459 (1948) (concurring opinion)).

 Given that our rule allows warrantless home entry when emergencies like these exist, we think the concurrence’s alarmism misplaced.  See, e.g., post, at 2 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.) (bewailing “danger[ ]” and “absurd[ity]”).  The concurrence spends most of its time worrying about cases in which there are exigencies above and beyond the flight itself: when, for example, the fleeing misdemeanant will “get a gun and take aim from inside” or “flush drugs down the toilet.”  Post, at 2, 8.  But again: When an officer reasonably believes those exigencies exist, he does not need a categorical misdemeanor-pursuit rule to justify a warrantless home entry.  (And contrary to the concurrence’s under-explained suggestion, see post, at 7–8, assessing exigencies is no harder in this context than in any other.)  The only cases in which we and the concurrence reach a different result are cases involving flight alone, without exigencies like the destruction of evidence, violence to others, or escape from the home.  It is telling that—although they are our sole disagreement—the concurrence hardly talks about those “flight alone” cases.  Apparently, it taxes even the concurrence to justify as an “exigency” a warrantless entry based only on a misdemeanant’s prior retreat into his home—when the police officers do not reasonably believe anything harmful will happen in the time it takes to get a warrant.

 In a 1763 Parliamentary debate, about searches made to enforce a tax, William Pitt the Elder orated as follows: “The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown.  It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the storm may enter; the rain may enter; but the King of England cannot enter—all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement!”  Miller v. United States,

357 U.S. 301, 307, and n. 7 (1958) (citing The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations 379 (2d ed. 1953); 15 T. Hansard, Parliamentary History of England, col. 1307 (1813)).

 Note, though, that if a person had already been arrested and then escaped from custody, an officer could always search for him at home.  See 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 87 (1721).

 Both felonies and pre-felonies justified the common law’s “hue and cry”: when a constable or other person “raise[d] the power of the towne”—“with horn and with voice”—to pursue an offender.  3 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England 116 (1644); Blackstone 293.  Most of the common-law authorities approved warrantless home entries upon a hue and cry.  But because that process was generally available only to apprehend felons and those who had “dangerously wounded any person,” it did not enlarge the range of qualifying offenses.  Hale 98; see Brief for Constitutional Accountability Center as Amicus Curiae 17–18.

 The term “breach of the peace” can today encompass many kinds of behavior, and even in common-law times it “meant very different things in different” contexts.  Atwater v. Lago Vista,

532 U.S. 318, 327, n. 2 (2001).  But “[m]ore often than not, when used in reference to common-law arrest power, the term seemed to connote an element of violence.”  Id., at 327–328, n. 2.

 The concurrence professes to disagree with this conclusion, see post, at 17–19 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.), but its account of the common law ends up in much the same place as ours.  The concurrence recognizes a categorical rule permitting warrantless home entry in pursuit of fleeing felons.  See post, at 17.  But for misdemeanants, the concurrence presents only discrete circumstances—mostly the same as ours—allowing home entry without a warrant.  Post, at 17–18.  Those particular instances of permissible entry do not create a categorical rule.
