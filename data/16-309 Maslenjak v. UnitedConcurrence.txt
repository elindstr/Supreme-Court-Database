															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 16–309

															DIVNA MASLENJAK, PETITIONER v.UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[June 22, 2017]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															The Court holds that the plain text and structure of the statute before us require the Government to prove causation as an element of conviction: The defendant’s illegal conduct must, in some manner, cause her naturalization.  I agree with this much and concur in Part II–A of the Court’s opinion to the extent it so holds.  And because the jury wasn’t instructed at all about causation, I agree too that reversal is required.

															But, respectfully, there I would stop.  In an effort to “operational[ize]” the statute’s causation requirement, the Court says a great deal more, offering, for example, two newly announced tests, the second with two more subparts, and a new affirmative defense—all while indicating that some of these new tests and defenses may apply only in some but not all cases.  See, e.g., ante, at 10–15.  The work here is surely thoughtful and may prove entirely sound.  But the question presented and the briefing before us focused primarily on whether the statute contains a materiality element, not on the contours of a causation requirement.  So the parties have not had the chance to join issue fully on the matters now decided.  Compare ante, at 10, n. 4, with Brief for Petitioner, pp. i, 18–38; Brief for United States, pp. i, 12–51.  And, of course, the lower courts have not had a chance to pass on any of these questions in the first instance.  Most cited by the Court have (again) focused only on the materiality (not causation) question; none has tested the elaborate operational details advanced today; and at least one has found our prior unilateral and fractured foray into a related statute in Kungys v. United States,

485 U. S. 759 (1988)
, “maddening[ ].”  See ante, at 10, n. 4 (collecting cases).

															Respectfully, it seems to me at least reasonably possible that the crucible of adversarial testing on which we usually depend, along with the experience of our thoughtful colleagues on the district and circuit benches, could yield insights (or reveal pitfalls) we cannot muster guided only by our own lights.  So while I agree with the Court that the parties will need guidance about the details of the statute’s causation requirement, see ibid., I have no doubt that the Court of Appeals, with aid of briefing from the parties, can supply that on remand.  Other circuits may improve that guidance over time too.  And eventually we can bless the best of it.  For my part, I believe it is work enough for the day to recognize that the statute requires some proof of causation, that the jury instructions here did not, and to allow the parties and courts of appeals to take it from there as they usually do.  This Court often speaks most wisely when it speaks last.
