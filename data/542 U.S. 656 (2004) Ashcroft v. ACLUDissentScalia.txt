542 U. S. ____ (2004)
ASHCROFT V. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION
542 U. S. ____ (2004)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-218

															JOHN D. ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL, PETITIONER
v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the third circuit

															[June 29, 2004]

															   Justice Scalia, dissenting.

															   I agree with Justice
Breyer’s conclusion that the Child Online Protection Act
(COPA), 47 U. S. C. §231, is constitutional. See
post, at 14 (dissenting opinion). Both the Court and
Justice Breyer err, however, in subjecting COPA to strict scrutiny.
Nothing in the First Amendment entitles the type of material
covered by COPA to that exacting standard of review. “We have
recognized that commercial entities which engage in ‘the
sordid business of pandering’ by ‘deliberately
emphasiz[ing] the sexually provocative aspects of [their nonobscene
products], in order to catch the salaciously disposed,’
engage in constitutionally unprotected behavior.” United
States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 831
(2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting Ginzburg v.
United States, 383 U. S. 463, 467, 472
(1966)). See also Los Angeles v. Alameda Books,
Inc., 535 U. S.
425, 443–444 (2002) (Scalia, J., concurring); FW/PBS,
Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215,
256–261 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part).

															   There is no doubt that the commercial
pornography covered by COPA fits this description. The statute
applies only to a person who, “as a regular course of such
person’s trade or business, with the objective of earning a
profit,” 47 U. S. C. §231(e)(2)(B), and “with
knowledge of the character of the material,” §231(a)(1),
communicates material that depicts certain specified sexual acts
and that “is designed to appeal to, or is designed to pander
to, the prurient interest,” §231(e)(6)(A). Since this
business could, consistent with the First Amendment, be banned
entirely, COPA’s lesser restrictions raise no constitutional
concern.
