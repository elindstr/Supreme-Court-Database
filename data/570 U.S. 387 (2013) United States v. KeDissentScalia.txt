															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ANTHONY JAMES
KEBODEAUX

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 24, 2013]

															

															     Justice Scalia,
dissenting.

															     I join Parts I, II, and
III–B of Justice Thomas’s dissent. I do not join Part
III–A because I do not agree that what is necessary and
proper to enforce a statute validly enacted pur- suant to an
enumerated power is not itself necessary and proper to the
execution of an enumerated power. It is my view that if
“Congress has the authority” to act, then it also
“ ‘possesses every power
needed’ ” to make that action
“ ‘effective.’ ” Gonzales v.
Raich, 545 U. S. 1, 36 (2005) (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment) (quoting United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315
U. S. 110 –119 (1942)). If I thought that SORNA’s
registration requirement were “ ‘rea- sonably
adapted,’ ” Raich, supra, at 37, to carrying into
execution some other, valid enactment, I would sustain it.

															     But it is not. The
lynchpin of the Court’s reasoning is that Kebodeaux was
“subject to a federal registration
requirement”—the Wetterling Act—at the time of
his offense, and so the Necessary and Proper Clause
“authorized Congress to modify the requirement as in SORNA
and to apply the modified requirement to Kebodeaux.” Ante, at
6. That does not establish, however, that the Wetterling
Act’s registration requirement was itself a valid exercise of
any federal power, or that SORNA is designed to carry the
Wetterling Act into execution. The former proposition is dubious,
the latter obviously untrue.
