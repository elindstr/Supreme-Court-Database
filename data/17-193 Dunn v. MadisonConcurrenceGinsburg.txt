															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															JEFFERSON DUNN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  v. VERNON MADISON

															on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

															No. 17–193. Decided November 6, 2017

															

															Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor join, concurring.

															The issue whether a State may administer the death penalty to a person whose disability leaves him without memory of his commission of a capital offense is a substantial question not yet addressed by the Court.  Appropriately presented, the issue would warrant full airing.  But in this case, the restraints imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, I agree, preclude consideration of the question.  With that understanding, I join the Court’s per curiam disposition of this case.
