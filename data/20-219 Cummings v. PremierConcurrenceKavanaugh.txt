															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															JANE CUMMINGS, PETITIONER v. PREMIER REHAB KELLER, P.L.L.C.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[April 28, 2022]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring.

															In analyzing whether compensatory damages for emotional distress are available under the implied Title VI cause of action, both the Court and the dissent ably employ the contract-law analogy set forth by this Court’s precedents.  See, e.g., Barnes v. Gorman,

536 U.S. 181, 186 (2002).  The dueling and persuasive opinions illustrate, however, that the contract-law analogy is an imperfect way to determine the remedies for this implied cause of action.

															Instead of continuing to rely on that imperfect analogy, I would reorient the inquiry to focus on a background interpretive principle rooted in the Constitution’s separation of powers.  Congress, not this Court, creates new causes of action.  See Alexander v. Sandoval,

532 U.S. 275, 286–287 (2001).  And with respect to existing implied causes of action, Congress, not this Court, should extend those implied causes of action and expand available remedies.  Cf. Hernández v. Mesa, 589 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 5); see also Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,

503 U.S. 60, 77–78 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  In my view, that background interpretive principle—more than contract-law analysis—counsels against judicially authorizing compensatory damages for emotional distress in suits under the implied Title VI cause of action.
