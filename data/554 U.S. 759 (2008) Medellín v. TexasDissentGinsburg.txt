															   Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.

															   I would grant the application for
a stay of execution. Before the International Court of Justice, in
response to Mexico’s request for provisional measures, the
United States represented: “[C]ontrary to Mexico’s
suggestion, the United States [does] not believe that it need make
no further effort to implement this Court’s Avena
Judgment, and … would ‘continue to work to give that
Judgment full effect, including in the case of Mr.
Medellín.’ ” Request for Interpretation
of the Judgment of 31 March 2004 in the Case Concerning Avena and
Other Mexican Nationals (Mex. v. U. S.), 2008
I. C. J. No. 139, ¶ 37 (Order of July 16). I would
invite the Solicitor General’s clarification of that
representation very recently made to the international tribunal.
Pending receipt and consideration of the Solicitor General’s
response, I would defer action on Medellín’s
submissions.
