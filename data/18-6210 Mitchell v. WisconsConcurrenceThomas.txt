															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															GERALD P. MITCHELL, PETITIONER v. WISCONSIN

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of wisconsin

															[June 27, 2019]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

															Today, the plurality adopts a difficult-to-administer rule: Exigent circumstances are generally present when police encounter a person suspected of drunk driving—except when they aren’t.  Compare ante, at 13, with ante, at 16.  The plurality’s presumption will rarely be rebutted, but it will nevertheless burden both officers and courts who must attempt to apply it. “The better (and far simpler) way to resolve” this case is to apply “the per se rule” I proposed in Missouri v. McNeely,

569 U.S. 141 (2013) (dissenting opinion).  Birchfield v. North Dakota, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (slip op., at 3).  Under that rule, the natural metabolization of alcohol in the blood stream “ ‘creates an exigency once police have probable cause to believe the driver is drunk,’ ” regardless of whether the driver is conscious.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Be- cause I am of the view that the Wisconsin Supreme Court should apply that rule on remand, I concur only in the judgment.

															I

															The
 
Fourth Amendment provides that “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.”  Although the
 
Fourth Amendment does not, by its text, require that searches be supported by a warrant, see Groh v. Ramirez,

540 U.S. 551, 571–573 (2004) (Thomas, J., dissenting), “this Court has inferred that a warrant must generally be secured” for a search to comply with the
 
Fourth Amendment, Kentucky v. King,

563 U.S. 452, 459 (2011).  We have also recognized, however, that this warrant presumption “may be overcome in some circumstances because ‘[t]he ultimate touchstone of the
 
Fourth Amendment is “reasonableness.” ’ ”  Ibid.  Accordingly, we have held that “the warrant requirement is subject to certain reasonable exceptions.”  Ibid.

															In recent years, this Court has twice considered whether warrantless blood draws fall within an exception to the warrant requirement.  First, in McNeely, a divided court held that the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream does not present a per se exigency that justifies an exception to the
 
Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement.  569 U. S., at 145.  Then, in Birchfield, we held that blood draws may not be administered as a search incident to a lawful arrest for drunk driving.  579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 35).  The question we face in this case is whether the blood draw here fell within one of the “reasonable exceptions” to the warrant requirement.

															II

															The “exigent circumstances” exception applies when “the needs of law enforcement [are] so compelling that [a] warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the
 
Fourth Amendment.”  King, 563 U. S., at 460 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Applying this doctrine, the Court has held that officers may conduct a warrantless search when failure to act would result in “the imminent destruction of evidence.”  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

															As I have explained before, “the imminent destruction of evidence” is a risk in every drunk-driving arrest and thus “implicates the exigent-circumstances doctrine.”  McNeely, 569 U. S., at 178.  “Once police arrest a suspect for drunk driving, each passing minute eliminates probative evidence of the crime” as alcohol dissipates from the bloodstream.  Id., at 177.  In many States, this “rapid destruction of evidence,” id., at 178, is particularly problematic because the penalty for drunk driving depends in part on the driver’s blood alcohol concentration, see ante, at 11.  Because the provisions of Wisconsin law at issue here allow blood draws only when the driver is suspected of impaired driving, ante, at 2–3, they fit easily within the exigency exception to the warrant requirement.

															Instead of adopting this straightforward rule, the plurality makes a flawed distinction between ordinary drunk-driving cases in which blood alcohol concentration evidence “is dissipating” and those that also include “some other [pressing] factor.”  Ante, at 6, 13, 16.  But whether “some other factor creates pressing health, safety, or law-enforcement needs that would take priority over a warrant application” is irrelevant.  Ante, at 13.  When police have probable cause to conclude that an individual was driving drunk, probative evidence is dissipating by the minute.  And that evidence dissipates regardless of whether police had another reason to draw the driver’s blood or whether “a warrant application would interfere with other pressing needs or duties.”  Ante, at 16.  The destruction of evidence alone is sufficient to justify a warrantless search based on exigent circumstances.  See generally McNeely, 569 U. S., at 176–179 (opinion of Thomas, J.).

															Presumably, the plurality draws these lines to avoid overturning McNeely.  See id., at 156 (majority opinion) (holding that “the natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood” does not “categorically” support a finding of exi- gency).  But McNeely was wrongly decided, see id., at 176–183 (opinion of Thomas, J.), and our decision in Birchfield has already undermined its rationale.  Specifically, the Court determined in McNeely that “[t]he context of blood testing is different in critical respects from other destruction-of-evidence cases in which the police are truly confronted with a now or never situation.”  569 U. S., at 153 (majority opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the Court stated in Birchfield that a distinction between “an arrestee’s active destruction of evidence and the loss of evidence due to a natural process makes little sense.”  579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 31); see also ante, at 11–12.  Moreover, to the extent McNeely was grounded in the belief that a per se rule was inconsistent with the “case by case,” “totality of the circumstances” analysis ordinarily applied in exigent-circumstances cases, see 569 U. S., at 156, that rationale was suspect from the start.  That the exigent-circumstances exception might ordinarily require “an evaluation of the particular facts of each case,” Birchfield, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 32), does not foreclose us from recognizing that a certain, dispositive fact is always present in some categories of cases.  In other words, acknowledging that destruction of evidence is at issue in every drunk-driving case does not undermine the general totality-of-the-circumstances approach that McNeely and Birchfield endorsed.  Cf. ante, at 9, n. 3.

															*  *  *

															The Court has consistently held that police officers may perform searches without a warrant when destruction of evidence is a risk.  United States v. Banks,

540 U.S. 31, 38 (2003); Richards v. Wisconsin,

520 U.S. 385, 395 (1997); Cupp v. Murphy,

412 U.S. 291, 295–296 (1973); Schmerber v. California,

384 U.S. 757, 770–772 (1966).  The rule should be no different in drunk-driving cases.  Because the plurality instead adopts a rule more likely to confuse than clarify, I concur only in the judgment.
