															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. ANTHONY JAMES
KEBODEAUX

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 24, 2013]

															

															     Justice Alito,
concurring in the judgment.

															     I concur in the
judgment solely on the ground that the registration requirement at
issue is necessary and proper to execute Congress’ power
“[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the
land and naval Forces.” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8,
cl. 14. Exercising this power, Congress has enacted provisions of
the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) that authorize members
of the military to be tried before a military tribunal, rather than
a state court, for ordinary criminal offenses, including sex
crimes, that are committed both within and outside the boundaries
of a military installation. See, e.g., UCMJ Art. 2 (persons subject
to UCMJ); Art. 5 (“This chapter applies in all
places”); Art. 120 (rape by a person subject to UCMJ);
Solorio v. United States, 483 U. S. 435 –438 (1987)
(servicemember may be court-martialed for off-base crime without
“service connection”). States usually have concurrent
jurisdiction over such crimes when they are committed off base and
sometimes possess jurisdiction over such offenses when committed on
base. [ 1 ] These offenses,
however, are rarely prosecuted in both a military and a state
court, and therefore when a servicemember is court-martialed for a
sex offense over which the State had jurisdiction, this is usually
because the State has deferred to the military. [ 2 ] Where the offense in question is a sex
crime, a consequence of this handling of the case is that the
offender, if convicted, may fall through the cracks of a state
registration system. For example, if the servicemember is convicted
of a sex offense in a state court, the state court may be required
by state law to provide that information to the state registry.
See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§16–22–104(1)(a)(I) (2012). State law may also
require the state corrections department to notify both state and
local police of the offender’s release. See, e.g.,
§16–22–107(3). Provisions such as these are
designed to prevent sex offenders from avoiding registration, as
many have in the past. See H. R. Rep. No. 109–218, pt. 1, p.
26 (2005) (despite pre-SORNA registration efforts, “[t]he
most significant enforcement issue in the sex offender program
[was] that over 100,000 sex offenders, or nearly one-fifth in the
Nation are ‘missing,’ meaning that they have not
complied with sex offender registration requirements”). When
a servicemember is convicted by a military tribunal, however, the
State has no authority to require that tribunal to notify the state
registry, nor does it have the authority to require the officials
at a military prison to notify state or local police when the
servicemember is released from custody. Because the exercise of
military jurisdiction may have this effect—in other words,
may create a gap in the laws intended to maximize the registration
of sex offenders—it is necessary and proper for Congress to
require the registration of members of the military who are
convicted of a qualifying sex offense in a military court. When
Congress, in validly exercising a power expressly conferred by the
Constitution, creates or exacerbates a dangerous situation (here,
the possibility that a convicted sex offender may escape
registration), Congress has the power to try to eliminate or at
least diminish that danger. See United States v. Comstock, 560 U.
S. 126 –158 (2010) (Alito, J., concurring in judgment). I
accordingly concur in the judgment only.

 “Where an act or
omission is subject to trial by court-martial and by one or more
civil tribunals,” “the determination which nation,
state, or agency will exercise jurisdiction is a matter for the
nations, states, and agencies concerned, and is not a right of the
suspect or accused.” Rule 201(d)(3). And as the commentary to
Rule 201(d) explains, “the determination which agency shall
exercise jurisdiction should normally be made through consultation
or prior agreement between appropriate military officials
. . . and appropriate civilian authorities.” See

§13–3(F), at 691; however, “as a matter of policy
a person who is pending trial or has been tried by a State court
should not ordinarily be triedby court-martial for the same
act,” Discussion following Rule 201(d), at 2–10; Air
