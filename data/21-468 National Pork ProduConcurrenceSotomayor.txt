															NATIONAL PORK PRODUCERS COUNCIL, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. KAREN ROSS, in her official capacity as
SECRETARY OF THE CALI- FORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD & AGRICULTURE,
et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 11, 2023]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kagan
joins, concurring in part.

															I join all but Parts IV–B and IV–D
of Justice Gorsuch’s opinion. Given the fractured nature of
Part IV, I write separately to clarify my understanding of why
petitioners’ Pike claim fails. In short, I vote to
affirm the judgment because petitioners fail to allege a
substantial burden on interstate commerce as required by
Pike, not because of any fundamental reworking of that
doctrine.

															*  *  *

															In Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,
397 U.S.
137 (1970), the Court distilled a general principle from its
prior cases. “Where [a] statute regulates even-handedly to
effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on
interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless
the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in
relation to the putative local benefits.” Id., at 142.
Further, “the extent of the burden that will be tolerated
will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved,
and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on
interstate activities.” Ibid.

															As the Court’s opinion here explains,
Pike’s balancing and tailoring principles are most
frequently deployed to detect the presence or absence of latent
economic protectionism. See ante, at 15–18. That is no
surprise. Warding off state discrimination against interstate
commerce is at the heart of our dormant Commerce Clause
jurisprudence. See ante, at 7, 9–11, 15–16.

															As the Court’s opinion also acknowledges,
however, the Court has “generally le[ft] the courtroom door
open” to claims premised on “even nondiscriminatory
burdens.” Department of Revenue of Ky. v.
Davis, 553 U.S.
328, 353 (2008); see ante, at 17. Indeed, “a small
number” of this Court’s cases in the Pike line
“have invalidated state laws . . . that appear to
have been genuinely nondiscriminatory” in nature. General
Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S.
278, 298, n. 12 (1997); see ante, at 17. Often, such
cases have addressed state laws that impose burdens on the arteries
of commerce, on “trucks, trains, and the like.”
Ibid., n. 2. Yet, there is at least one exception to
that tradition. See Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U.S.
624, 643–646 (1982) (invalidating a nondiscriminatory
state law that regulated tender offers to shareholders).

															Pike claims that do not allege
discrimination or a burden on an artery of commerce are further
from Pike’s core. As The Chief Justice recognizes,
however, the Court today does not shut the door on all such
Pike claims. See ante, at 17–18, and n. 2;
post, at 2–3. Thus, petitioners’ failure to
allege discrimination or an impact on the instrumentalities of
commerce does not doom their Pike claim.

															Nor does a majority of the Court endorse the
view that judges are not up to the task that Pike
prescribes. Justice Gorsuch, for a plurality, concludes that
petitioners’ Pike claim fails because courts are
incapable of balancing economic burdens against noneconomic
benefits. See ante, at 18–21. I do not join that
portion of Justice Gorsuch’s opinion. I acknowledge that the
inquiry is difficult and delicate, and federal courts are well
advised to approach the matter with caution. See ante, at
28. Yet, I agree with The Chief Justice that courts generally are
able to weigh disparate burdens and benefits against each other,
and that they are called on to do so in other areas of the law with
some frequency. See post, at 3–4. The means-ends
tailoring analysis that Pike incorporates is likewise
familiar to courts and does not raise the asserted
incommensurability problems that trouble Justice Gorsuch.

															In my view, and as Justice Gorsuch concludes for
a separate plurality of the Court, petitioners’ Pike
claim fails for a much narrower reason. Reading petitioners’
allegations in light of the Court’s decision in Exxon
Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437
U.S. 117 (1978), the complaint fails to allege a substantial
burden on interstate commerce. See ante, at 21–25.
Alleging a substantial burden on interstate commerce is a threshold
requirement that plaintiffs must satisfy before courts need even
engage in Pike’s balancing and tailoring analyses.
Because petitioners have not done so, they fail to state a
Pike claim.
