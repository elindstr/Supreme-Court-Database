															KINDRED NURSING CENTERS LIMITED PARTNER-SHIP, dba WINCHESTER CENTRE FOR HEALTH AND REHABILITATION, nka FOUNTAIN CIRCLE HEALTH AND REHABILITA-TION, et al., PETITIONERS v. JANIS E. CLARK et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of kentucky

															[May 15, 2017]

															

															Justice Thomas, dissenting.

															I continue to adhere to the view that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA),

9 U. S. C. §1 et seq., does not apply to proceedings in state courts.  See Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,

513 U. S. 265
–297 (1995) (Thomas, J., dissenting); see also DIRECTV, Inc. v. Imburgia, 577 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (same) (slip op., at 1); Preston v. Ferrer,

552 U. S. 346,
363 (2008)
 (same); Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna,

546 U. S. 440,
449 (2006)
 (same); Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle,

539 U. S. 444,
460 (2003)
 (same); Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto,

517 U. S. 681,
689 (1996)
 (same).  In state-court proceedings, therefore, the FAA does not displace a rule that requires express authorization from a principal before an agent may waive the principal’s right to a jury trial.  Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Kentucky Supreme Court.
