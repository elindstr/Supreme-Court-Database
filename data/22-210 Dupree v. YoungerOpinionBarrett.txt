															NEIL DUPREE, PETITIONER v. KEVIN
YOUNGER

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[May 25, 2023]

															

															Justice Barrett delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															In Ortiz v. Jordan, we held that
an order denying summary judgment on sufficiency-of-the-evidence
grounds is not appealable after a trial. 562
U.S. 180 (2011). Thus, a party who wants to preserve a
sufficiency challenge for appeal must raise it anew in a post-trial
motion. The question presented in this case is whether this
preservation requirement extends to a purely legal issue resolved
at summary judgment. The answer is no.

															I

															A

															The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure empower
district courts to direct the entry of judgment before, during, or
after trial. Before trial, the defendant can file a motion to
dismiss the complaint based on certain defenses, such as lack of
jurisdiction or failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b). If the district court denies
that motion (or any other Rule 12 motion), the case advances to
discovery for the parties to marshal evidence supporting their
claims and defenses. During or after that process, either party can
move for summary judgment under Rule 56, which requires a district
court to enter judgment on a claim or defense if there is “no
genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled
to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
56(a).

															If the plaintiff ’s claims survive
summary judgment, the case proceeds to trial. After the
presentation of evidence, but before the case is submitted to the
jury, Rule 50(a) authorizes either party to move for judgment as a
matter of law.[1] This standard
largely “mirrors” the summary-judgment standard, the
difference being that district courts evaluate Rule 50(a) motions
in light of the trial record rather than the discovery record.
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S.
242, 250–251 (1986).

															If the district court does not grant the motion,
then the jury will render a verdict. After the verdict, Rule 50(b)
permits a disappointed party to file a renewed motion for judgment
as a matter of law (which may also include a request for a new
trial under Rule 59). The next step for a party who fails to obtain
post-trial relief is an appeal.

															B

															While Kevin Younger was being held as a
pretrial detainee in a Maryland state prison, three corrections
officers assaulted him. Younger believed that Neil Dupree, a former
lieutenant in the prison, had ordered the attack. He sued Dupree
and other prison officials for damages under 42 U. S. C.
§1983, alleging that they had used excessive force in
violation of his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.

															Dupree moved for summary judgment, arguing that
Younger had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as
required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U. S. C.
§1997e(a). The District Court denied the motion. It noted
factual disagreements between the parties about whether Younger had
adhered to Maryland’s Administrative Remedy Procedure but
concluded that it “need not resolve [those] disputes.”
Younger v. Green, Civ. No. 16–3269 (D Md., Dec.
19, 2019), App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a. Instead, the court observed
that there was “no dispute” that the Maryland prison
system had internally investigated Younger’s assault.
Ibid. And it held that this inquiry satisfied
Younger’s exhaustion obligation.

															The case then proceeded to a jury trial. Dupree
did not present any evidence relating to his exhaustion defense,
nor did he invoke exhaustion in his Rule 50(a) motion, which the
District Court denied. The jury found Dupree and four of his
codefendants liable and awarded Younger $700,000 in damages. Dupree
did not file a post-trial motion under Rule 50(b).

															Dupree appealed a single issue to the Fourth
Circuit: the District Court’s rejection of his exhaustion
defense at summary judgment. Unfortunately for Dupree, the appeal
was over before it began. Fourth Circuit precedent maintains that a
claim or defense rejected at summary judgment is not preserved for
appellate review unless it was renewed in a post-trial
motion—even when the issue is a purely legal one.
Varghese v. Honeywell Int’l, Inc.,

424 F.3d 411, 422–423 (2005). Bound by this precedent,
the panel dismissed the appeal.

															The Fourth Circuit’s decision further
cemented a conflict among the Courts of Appeals over whether a
purely legal challenge resolved at summary judgment must be renewed
in a post-trial motion in order to preserve that challenge for
appellate review. We granted certiorari to resolve the
disagreement.[2] 598 U. S.
___ (2023).

															A

															The jurisdiction of the Courts of Appeals
under 28 U. S. C. §1291 is limited to “appeals
from . . . final decisions of the district courts.”
Interlocutory orders—those that do not dispose of the whole
case, like denials of summary judgment—are typically not
immediately appealable under §1291.[3] Instead, the “general rule is that ‘a
party is entitled to a single appeal, to be deferred until final
judgment has been entered, in which claims of district court error
at any stage of the litigation may be
ventilated.’ ” Quackenbush v. Allstate
Ins. Co., 517 U.S.
706, 712 (1996); see also 15A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.
Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3905.1 (3d ed. 2022)
(generally, “an appeal from final judgment opens the record
and permits review of all rulings that led up to the
judgment”).

															Some interlocutory district-court rulings,
however, are unreviewable after final judgment because they are
overcome by later developments in the litigation. As Ortiz
explains, one such ruling is the denial of summary judgment on
sufficiency-of-the-evidence grounds. 562 U. S., at 184.
Factual challenges depend on, well, the facts, which the parties
develop and clarify as the case progresses from summary judgment to
a jury verdict. Thus, “[o]nce the case proceeds to trial, the
full record developed in court supersedes the record existing at
the time of the summary-judgment motion.” Ibid. So
after trial, a district court’s assessment of the facts based
on the summary-judgment record becomes “ancient history and
[is] not subject to appeal.” Empress Casino Joliet
Corp. v. Balmoral Racing Club, Inc., 831 F.3d 815,
823–824 (CA7 2016). Fact-dependent appeals must be appraised
in light of the complete trial record.

															It follows, Ortiz holds, that a party
must raise a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim in a post-trial
motion to preserve it for appeal. 562 U. S., at 191–192.
Appellate review, by its nature, requires a lower court decision to
review. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S.
868, 895 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment) (the “very word ‘review’ presupposes
that a litigant’s arguments have been raised and considered
in the tribunal of first instance”). This is especially
important for factual challenges based on the trial record, which
“cal[l] for the judgment in the first instance of the judge
who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which
no appellate printed transcript can impart.” Cone v.
West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330
U.S. 212, 216 (1947). The filing of a post-trial motion under
Rule 50 allows the district court to take first crack at the
question that the appellate court will ultimately face: Was there
sufficient evidence in the trial record to support the
jury’s verdict? Absent such a motion, “an appellate
court is ‘powerless’ to review the sufficiency of the
evidence after trial.” Ortiz, 562 U. S., at 189
(quoting Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich,
Inc., 546 U.S.
394, 405 (2006)).

															B

															Younger urges us to extend
Ortiz’s holding to cover pure questions of law
resolved in an order denying summary judgment. We decline the
invitation.

															While factual issues addressed in
summary-judgment denials are unreviewable on appeal, the same is
not true of purely legal issues—that is, issues that can be
resolved without reference to any disputed facts. Trials wholly
supplant pretrial factual rulings, but they leave pretrial legal
rulings undisturbed. The point of a trial, after all, is not to
hash out the law. Because a district court’s purely legal
conclusions at summary judgment are not “supersede[d]”
by later developments in the litigation, Ortiz, 562
U. S., at 184, these rulings follow the “general
rule” and merge into the final judgment, at which point they
are reviewable on appeal, Quackenbush, 517 U. S., at
712.

															That difference explains why a summary-judgment
motion is sufficient to preserve legal but not factual claims. As
Ortiz explains, an appellate court’s review of factual
challenges after a trial is rooted in the complete trial record,
which means that a district court’s factual rulings based on
the obsolete summary-judgment record are useless. A district
court’s resolution of a pure question of law, by contrast, is
unaffected by future developments in the case. From the reviewing
court’s perspective, there is no benefit to having a district
court reexamine a purely legal issue after trial, because nothing
at trial will have given the district court any reason to question
its prior analysis. We therefore hold that a post-trial motion
under Rule 50 is not required to preserve for appellate review a
purely legal issue resolved at summary judgment.

															C

															Younger’s counterarguments do not
persuade us otherwise. First, he argues that under Ortiz, an
order denying summary judgment is not a “final
decision” under §1291 and cannot be appealed, regardless
of whether the motion was decided on legal or factual grounds. We
agree that a denial of summary judgment is “simply a step
along the route to final judgment,” and so is typically not
immediately appealable. Ortiz, 562 U. S., at 184. But
§1291 does not insulate interlocutory orders from appellate
scrutiny; it simply delays review until final judgment.
Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U.S.
424, 430 (1985) (noting that some errors in interlocutory
orders “go uncorrected until the appeal of a final
judgment”). Indeed, the Ortiz Court expressly declined
to address whether summary-judgment denials on purely legal issues
are reviewable. 562 U. S., at 190. That caveat would have made
little sense had the Court authoritatively decided that all
summary-judgment denials are meaningless passthroughs that
appellate courts should ignore.

															Next, Younger complains that Dupree’s rule
creates a two-track system of summary judgment, in which factual
and legal claims follow different routes. Summary judgment is
summary judgment, Younger insists, so the claims should all travel
the same line. But nothing in Rule 56 demands such uniformity. On
the contrary, the Rule provides that summary judgment is
appropriate when “the movant shows that there is no genuine
dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled
to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a)
(emphasis added). Rule 56 thus contemplates that the court will
sometimes deny the motion because the facts are genuinely in
dispute and other times because the law does not support the
movant’s position. Fitting the preservation rule to the
court’s rationale (factual or legal) is therefore consistent
with the text.

															It also makes sense. Because a purely legal
question is, by definition, one whose answer is independent of
disputed facts, factual development at trial will not change the
district court’s answer. (Granted, the district court might
backtrack, but if the question is purely legal, that is because of
law books, not trial exhibits.) So what would a repeat-motion
requirement for legal questions typically amount to? For litigants,
a copy and paste of summary-judgment motions into post-trial
format. For district courts, the tedium of saying no twice. There
is no reason to force litigants and district courts to undertake
that empty exercise.

															Rule 56 aside, Younger insists that Rule 50
supports him. Under this Rule, a district court can grant judgment
as a matter of law if it finds that “a reasonable jury would
not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for
the party on that issue.” Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 50(a), (b)
(emphasis added). Therefore, Younger says, a Rule 50 motion is an
appropriate vehicle for raising purely legal issues once a case
proceeds to trial. Maybe so, but this argument is beside the point:
Even if a party can raise legal issues in a Rule 50 motion,
nothing in the Rule requires her to do so.

															Finally, Younger predicts that a separate
preservation rule for legal issues will prove unworkable because
the line between factual and legal questions can be
“vexing” for courts and litigants.
Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456
U.S. 273, 288 (1982). That’s a fair concern, and it would
not be surprising if “prudent counsel . . . make
sure to renew their arguments in a Rule 50 motion” out of an
abundance of caution. Feld v. Feld, 688 F.3d 779, 783
(CADC 2012). But Younger overstates the need for a bright-line rule
in this area. “Courts of appeals have long found it possible
to separate factual from legal matters.” Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S.
318, 328 (2015). Though there will be edge cases, the
experience of the majority of circuits demonstrates that the Courts
of Appeals are up to the task. See n. 2, supra. And for
all the virtues of bright-line rules, Younger’s would come at
a steep cost: the loss of appellate review for unwary litigants who
think it futile to relitigate an already-rejected legal
argument.

															III

															The Fourth Circuit was wrong to hold that
purely legal issues resolved at summary judgment must be renewed in
a post-trial motion. We need not decide whether the issue Dupree
raised on appeal is purely legal—the Court of Appeals may
evaluate that and any other properly preserved arguments in the
first instance. We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of
Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

 If the parties waive
their rights to a jury or seek relief that does not entitle them to
a jury, the district court will hold a bench trial, which is
governed by Rule 52.

 The collateral-order
doctrine recognizes exceptions to this rule. For instance, an
interlocutory order denying qualified immunity is sometimes
immediately appealable. Mitchell v. Forsyth,
