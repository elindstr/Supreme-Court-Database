APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA
Syllabus 

															The evidence and principles decided in this case are the same in substance with those in United States v. Philadelphia, 11 How. 609.

															The case is stated in the opinion.

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The appellees in this case claim title to the land in question under certain instruments of writing executed by the Baron Carondelet in favor of the Baron Bastrop in 1796 and 1797, which are fully set out in the case of The United States v. The Cities of
Page 154 U. S. 532
Philadelphia and New Orleans, reported in 11 How. 609.  It was decided in that case that these instruments of writing did not convey to the Baron Bastrop a title to the lands therein described.  The decree in this case in favor of the appellees must therefore be reversed and a mandate issued directing the district court to enter a decree in favor of the United States and dismiss the petition.

															This case not to be reported, the evidence and principles decided being the same in substance with the case referred to in 11 Howard's Reports.

															Reversed.
