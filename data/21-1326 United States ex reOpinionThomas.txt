															on writs of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 1, 2023]

															Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															The False Claims Act (FCA) imposes liability on
anyone who “knowingly” submits a “false”
claim to the Government. 31 U. S. C. §3729(a). In
some cases, that rule is straightforward: If a law authorized
payment of $100 for “each” medical test, and a doctor
knows that he did five tests but submits a claim for ten, then he
has knowingly submitted a false claim. But sometimes the rule is
less clear. If a law authorized payment for only
“customary” medical tests, some doctors might be
confused when it came time for billing. And, while some doctors
might honestly mistake what that term means, others might correctly
understand whatever “customary” meant in this
context—and submit claims that were inaccurate anyway.

															The cases before us today involve a legal
standard similar to that latter example: In certain circumstances,
pharmacies are required to bill Medicare and Medicaid for their
“usual and customary” drug prices. And, critically,
these cases involve defendants (respondents here) who may have
correctly understood the relevant standard and submitted inaccurate
claims anyway. The question presented is thus whether respondents
could have the scienter required by the FCA if they correctly
understood that standard and thought that their claims were
inaccurate.

															We hold that the answer is yes: What matters for
an FCA case is whether the defendant knew the claim was false.
Thus, if respondents correctly interpreted the relevant phrase and
believed their claims were false, then they could have known their
claims were false.

															I

															The FCA permits private parties to bring
lawsuits in the name of the United States—called
qui tam lawsuits—against those who they believe
have defrauded the Federal Government. §3730(b). Petitioners
here brought two such lawsuits against respondents, which are
companies that operate hundreds of retail drug pharmacies
nationwide. In No. 21–1326, respondents are a group of
companies that we collectively call SuperValu; in No. 22–111,
respondent is Safeway, Inc. According to petitioners, respondents
overcharged Medicare and Medicaid programs for years when seeking
reimbursement for prescription drugs that the programs covered. In
doing so, petitioners argue, respondents defrauded the Government
and violated the FCA.

															A

															The claims at issue here relate to two federal
benefits programs: Medicaid, which establishes a cooperative
federal-state program that provides medical assistance to certain
low-income individuals, see 42 U. S. C. §1396
et seq., and Medicare, which provides federally funded
health insurance coverage to individuals who are 65 or older or who
are disabled, see 42 U. S. C. §1395
et seq.

															As relevant here, States’ Medicaid plans
may offer outpatient prescription-drug coverage to qualifying
individuals. §1396d(a)(12). However, the Federal Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has promulgated regulations
that limit the amount these programs may reimburse for certain
drugs. See 42 CFR §447.512(b)(2) (2021). Those regulations
limit any reimbursement to the lower of two amounts, one of which
is the healthcare provider’s “usual and customary
charges [for the drug] to the general public.” Ibid.
State Medicaid agencies likewise typically reimburse pharmacies for
the lowest of different amounts, one of which is often the
pharmacy’s “usual and customary charge” to the
public. See CMS, Medicaid Covered Outpatient Prescription Drug
Reimbursement Information by State, Quarter Ending September 2022
(Nov. 16, 2022),
https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/
state-prescription-drug-resources/medicaid-covered-
outpatient-prescription-drug-reimbursement-information-state/.

															Through Medicare Part D, the Government also
offers prescription-drug coverage to beneficiaries. See 42
U. S. C. §1395w–101 et seq.; 42
CFR pt. 423. To administer that coverage, CMS awards contracts to
private plan sponsors. See 42 U. S. C.
§1395w–115; 42 CFR §§423.315, 423.329. Those
plan sponsors, in turn, enter contracts with pharmacies (sometimes
through middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers). Many of the
contracts at issue here limited any reimbursement to the
pharmacy’s “usual and customary” price.

															The bottom line is that, when respondents
submitted reimbursement claims to these entities, they often were
required to charge and disclose their “usual and
customary” price for that drug.[1] But, according to petitioners, respondents reported
higher prices to these entities than the ones that they usually and
customarily charged to the public.

															B

															According to petitioners, in 2006,
respondents’ competitor, Walmart, began offering 30-day
supplies of many drugs for $4.[2] To compete with Walmart, SuperValu and Safeway adopted
price-match programs in which their pharmacies would match a
competitor’s lower price at a customer’s request.
SuperValu’s pharmacies would then automatically apply that
price to future refills of the drug for those customers. Meanwhile,
Safeway also adopted a “membership” discount program
through which customers received discounted generic drug prices
(often $4 for a 30-day supply). To enroll in that membership
program, customers had to fill out a form with only basic
information; petitioners argue that Safeway often already had this
information on file. SuperValu’s programs continued until
2016; Safeway’s continued until 2015.

															Respondents’ discount programs turned out
to be popular. Though the exact extent of that popularity is
disputed, petitioners have presented evidence that the discounted
prices comprised a majority of sales for many drugs to customers
who paid in cash (and not through insurance) for at least some
years during the programs’ operation. For example, according
to petitioners, a majority of SuperValu’s 2012 cash sales for
44 of its 50 top-selling prescription drugs were made at those
discounted prices. And, according to petitioners, 88% of
Safeway’s 2014 cash sales for its top 20 generic drugs were
at discounted rates.

															Petitioners contend that those discounted prices
were actually respondents’ “usual and customary”
prices—and that, rather than submitting those lower prices
for reimbursement, respondents instead reported their higher,
non-discounted prices. For example, petitioners have presented
evidence that Safeway charged just $10 for 94% of its cash sales
for a 90-day supply of a cholesterol drug between 2008 and 2012.
Yet Safeway apparently reported prices as high as $108 as
“usual and customary” during that time. And petitioners
presented evidence that, at least at some times and for some drugs,
SuperValu made more than 80% of its cash sales for prices less than
what it disclosed as its “usual and customary”
price.

															To be sure, the phrase “usual and
customary” on its face appears somewhat open to
interpretation. But petitioners contend that respondents were
informed that their lower, discounted prices were their
“usual and customary” prices, believed their discounted
prices were their “usual and customary” prices, and
tried to hide their discounted prices from regulators and
contractors. Petitioners have presented evidence that they claim
supports that theory. For example, both SuperValu and Safeway
received a notice in 2006 from a pharmacy benefit manager stating
that the phrase “usual and customary” refers to
discounted prices; Safeway apparently received the same message
from state Medicaid agencies. And executives at both companies
raised concerns about letting state agencies or pharmacy benefit
managers find out about their discounted prices.

															For example, some emails between SuperValu
executives described their discount program as a “stealthy
approach” and noted concern for the “integrity”
of their “U&C price” claims. App. to Pet. for Cert.
in No. 21–1326, p. 67a (internal quotation marks
omitted). An executive at Safeway similarly stated that “[w]e
may have some issues with U&C” and that “if you
[match a] price offer, that becomes your usual and customary
[price] for that day.” 30 F. 4th 649, 667 (CA7 2022)
(internal quotation marks omitted). Other documents directed
Safeway’s employees to match Walmart prices, but cautioned
that employees should not “put any of this in writing to
stores because our official policy is we do not match.”
Id., at 666. Petitioners argue that this and other evidence
show that respondents thought that their claims were inaccurate yet
submitted them anyway.

															C

															Before proceeding, some context about how
these cases reached us is useful to understand the question
presented. The FCA (as relevant here) imposes liability on those
who “knowingly presen[t] . . . a false or
fraudulent claim for payment or approval.”
§3729(a)(1)(A). Thus, two essential elements of an FCA
violation are (1) the falsity of the claim and (2) the
defendant’s knowledge of the claim’s falsity.

															In SuperValu’s case, the District Court
ruled against SuperValu on the falsity element—it determined
that SuperValu’s discounted prices were its “usual and
customary” prices and that, by not reporting them, SuperValu
submitted claims that were false. But, the District Court then
granted summary judgment for SuperValu based on the scienter
element, holding SuperValu could not have acted
“knowingly.” Soon after, it granted Safeway summary
judgment on the same basis.

															The Seventh Circuit affirmed. 9 F. 4th 455
(2021). In doing so, it relied heavily on Safeco Ins. Co. of
America v. Burr, 551 U.S.
47 (2007)—a case that interpreted the term
“ ‘willfully’ ” in the Fair
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), id., at 52. Specifically, the
Seventh Circuit read Safeco to dictate a two-step inquiry
for ascertaining whether a defendant acted recklessly or knowingly.
At step one, the Seventh Circuit took Safeco to ask whether
a defendant’s acts were consistent with any objectively
reasonable interpretation of the relevant law that had not been
ruled out by definitive legal authority or guidance. This step, the
Seventh Circuit held, applied regardless of whether the defendant
actually believed such an interpretation at the time of its claims.
Only if the defendant’s acts were not consistent with any
objectively reasonable interpretation would the court proceed, at
step two, to consider the defendant’s actual subjective
thoughts. Thus, under the Seventh Circuit’s approach, a claim
would have to be objectively unreasonable, as a legal matter,
before a defendant could be held liable for “knowingly”
submitting a false claim, no matter what the defendant thought.

															Turning to the facts here, the Seventh Circuit
held that respondents were entitled to summary judgment because
their actions were consistent with an objectively reasonable
interpretation of the phrase “usual and customary.”
Specifically, the court reasoned that the phrase could have
been understood as referring to respondents’ retail prices,
not their discounted prices—even if the phrase, correctly
understood, referred to their discounted prices. It thus did not
matter whether respondents thought that their discounted prices
were actually their “usual and customary” prices. What
mattered, instead, was that someone else, standing in
respondents’ shoes, may have reasonably thought that the
retail prices were what counted.

															We granted certiorari, see 598 U. S. ___
(2023), to resolve that legal question: If respondents’
claims were false and they actually thought that their claims were
false—because they believed that their reported prices were
not actually their “usual and customary”
prices—then would they have “knowingly” submitted
a false claim within the FCA’s meaning? Or is the Seventh
Circuit correct—that respondents could not have
“knowingly” submitted a false claim unless no
hypothetical, reasonable person could have thought that their
reported prices were their “usual and customary”
prices?

															It is equally important to recognize what we did
not grant certiorari to review: We are not reviewing the
meaning of the phrase “usual and customary” or whether
any of respondents’ claims were, in fact, inaccurate or
otherwise false. Nor are we reviewing whether respondents actually
thought that the phrase “usual and customary” referred
to their discounted prices. Nor, for that matter, are we reviewing
any factual disputes about what respondents did or did not believe
or do. These cases come to us from the grant of summary judgment to
respondents on one discrete legal issue, and we granted certiorari
to resolve only that issue.

															II

															Based on the FCA’s statutory text and
its common-law roots, the answer to the question presented is
straightforward: The FCA’s scienter element refers to
respondents’ knowledge and subjective beliefs—not to
what an objectively reasonable person may have known or believed.
And, even though the phrase “usual and customary” may
be ambiguous on its face, such facial ambiguity alone is not
sufficient to preclude a finding that respondents knew their claims
were false.

															A

															We start, as always, with the text of the FCA.
See Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States
ex rel. Escobar, 579 U.S. 176, 187 (2016). Here, the FCA
defines the term “knowingly” as encompassing three
mental states: First, that the person “has actual knowledge
of the information,” §3729(b)(1)(A)(i). Second, that the
person “acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity
of the information,” §3729(b)(1)(A)(ii). And, third,
that the person “acts in reckless disregard of the truth or
falsity of the information,” §3729(b)(1)(A)(iii). In
short, either actual knowledge, deliberate ignorance, or
recklessness will suffice.[3]

															That three-part test largely tracks the
traditional common-law scienter requirement for claims of fraud.
See Restatement (Second) of Torts §526 (1976); Restatement
(Third) of Torts: Liability for Economic Harm §10 (2018). For
example, one widely cited English decision, Derry v.
Peek, [1889] 14 App. Cas., articulated the rule as follows:
“[F]raud is proved when it is shewn that a false
representation has been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief
in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or
false.” Id., at 374 (judgment of Lord Herschell). And,
capturing the FCA’s use of the term “deliberate
ignorance,” that decision noted that an action for fraud
would lie if “a person making a false statement had shut his
eyes to the facts, or purposely abstained from inquiring into
them.” Id., at 376. Those standards have been cited
and widely adopted by American courts in the century since. See 3
D. Dobbs, P. Hayden, & E. Bublick, Law of Torts §665,
p. 645 (2d ed. 2011) (Dobbs); Restatement (Second) of Torts,
App. §526, Reporter’s Note.

															That the text of the FCA tracks the common law
is unsurprising because, as we have recognized, the FCA is largely
a fraud statute. See Escobar, 579 U. S., at
187–188, and n. 2. Indeed, the FCA was first enacted in
1863 to “ ‘sto[p] the massive frauds perpetrated
by large contractors during the Civil War.’ ”
Id., at 181. To this day, the FCA refers to
“ ‘false or fraudulent’ ”
claims, pointing directly to “the common-law meaning of
fraud.” Id., at 187 (emphasis added). In the absence
of statutory text to the contrary, we would assume that
“ ‘Congress intends to incorporate the
well-settled meaning’ ” of such a common-law term.
See ibid. And here, the FCA’s definition of
“knowingly” confirms that assumption by largely
tracking the common-law scienter standards for fraud.

															On their face and at common law, the FCA’s
standards focus primarily on what respondents thought and believed.
First, the term “actual knowledge” refers to whether a
person is “aware of ” information.[4] See Intel Corp. Investment Policy
Comm. v. Sulyma, 589 U. S. ___, ___–___
(2020) (slip op., at 6–7); Escobar, 579 U. S., at
191 (“A defendant can have ‛actual knowledge’
that a condition is material without the Government expressly
calling it a condition of payment”); Black’s Law
Dictionary 784 (5th ed. 1979) (“to understand,” or
“the perception of the truth”); Restatement (Second) of
Torts §526, and Comment c. Second, the term
“deliberate ignorance” encompasses defendants who are
aware of a substantial risk that their statements are false, but
intentionally avoid taking steps to confirm the statement’s
truth or falsity. See Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB
S. A., 563 U.S.
754, 769 (2011); Black’s Law Dictionary, at 672
(“[v]oluntary ignorance”); Derry, 14 App. Cas.,
at 376. And, third, the term “reckless disregard”
similarly captures defendants who are conscious of a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that their claims are false, but submit the
claims anyway. See Black’s Law Dictionary, at 1142;
Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S.
825, 836 (1994); Restatement (Third) of Torts §10, Comment
c.[5]

															Again, that tracks traditional common-law fraud,
which ordinarily “depends on a subjective test” and the
defendant’s “culpable state of mind.” Id.,
§10, Comment a. What typically matters at common law is
whether the defendant made the false statement “without
belief in its truth or recklessly, careless of whether it is true
or false.” Restatement (Second) of Torts §526, Comment
e. If a defendant knows that he “lack[s an] honest
belief ” in the statement’s truth, that is often
enough to establish scienter for fraud. Id., Comment
d.; Dobbs §665, at 647.

															Both the text and the common law also point to
what the defendant thought when submitting the false
claim—not what the defendant may have thought after
submitting it. As noted above, the text encompasses those who
“knowingly presen[t] . . . a false or fraudulent
claim”; the term “knowingly” thus modifies
present-tense verbs like “presents.”
§3729(a)(1)(A). As such, the focus is not, as respondents
would have it, on post hoc interpretations that might have
rendered their claims accurate. It is instead on what the defendant
knew when presenting the claim. See also Restatement (Second) of
Torts §526, Comment e (“It is enough that being
conscious that he has neither knowledge nor belief in the existence
of the matter he chooses to assert it as a fact”); accord,
Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics, Inc.,
579 U.S. 93, 105 (2016) (“[C]ulpability is generally measured
against the knowledge of the actor at the time of the challenged
conduct”).

															B

															The difficulty here, however, is that the
phrase “usual and customary” is, on its face, less than
perfectly clear. We assume (as the District Court ruled in
SuperValu’s case) that respondents’ “usual and
customary” prices were their discounted ones; if so, it might
have been a forgivable mistake if respondents had honestly read the
phrase as referring to retail prices, not discounted prices. But
the Seventh Circuit did not hold that respondents made an honest
mistake; it held that, because other people might make an
honest mistake, defendants’ subjective beliefs became
irrelevant to their scienter. Respondents make three main arguments
in support of that rule. But none is persuasive.

															1

															Respondents first focus on the inherent
ambiguity of the phrase at issue here, asserting that they could
not have “known” that their claims were inaccurate
because they could not have “known” what the phrase
“usual and customary” actually meant. The most that is
possible, respondents posit, is that they took a (correct)
guess.

															We disagree. Although the terms, in isolation,
may have been somewhat ambiguous, that ambiguity does not preclude
respondents from having learned their correct meaning—or, at
least, becoming aware of a substantial likelihood of the
terms’ correct meaning. To illustrate why, consider a
hypothetical driver who sees a road sign that says “Drive
Only Reasonable Speeds.” That driver, without any more
information, might have no way of knowing what speeds are
reasonable and what speeds are too fast. But then assume that the
same driver was informed earlier in the day by a police officer
that speeds over 50 mph are unreasonable and then noticed that all
the other cars around him are going only 48 mph. In that case, the
driver might know that “Reasonable Speeds” are anything
under 50 mph; or, at the least, he might be aware of an
unjustifiably high risk that anything over 50 mph is unreasonable.
Indeed, if the same police officer later pulled the driver over, we
imagine that he would be hard pressed to argue that some other
person might have understood the sign to allow driving at 80
mph.

															The same analysis applies here. According to
petitioners, respondents received notice that the phrase
“usual and customary” referred to their discounted
prices (in some cases, it seems, from the same entities to which
they reported their prices). And, according to petitioners,
respondents comprehended those notices and then tried to hide their
discounted prices. If that is true, then perhaps respondents
actually knew what the phrase meant; or perhaps respondents were
aware of an unjustifiably high risk that the phrase referred to
their discounted prices. And, if that is true, then respondents may
have known that their claims were false. The facial ambiguity of
the phrase thus does not by itself preclude a finding of scienter
under the FCA.

															2

															Second, like the Seventh Circuit, respondents
rely on Safeco. They contend that Safeco already
interpreted the common-law definitions of “knowing” and
“reckless” and that it did so by looking first at
whether the defendant’s “reading of the statute”
was “objectively unreasonable.” 551 U. S., at 69.
Accordingly, respondents conclude that, because the FCA has the
same common-law terms, it should be read with the same, objective
common-law focus.

															This argument fails twice over. First,
Safeco interpreted a different statute, the FCRA, which had
a different mens rea standard,
“ ‘willfully.’ ” Id., at
52 (quoting 15 U. S. C. §1681n(a)). While Safeco
did reference the common law’s standards for
“knowing” and “reckless” conduct, see 551
U. S., at 59–60, 68–69, its interpretation was
ultimately tied to the FCRA’s particular text. To take
Safeco as establishing categorical rules for those terms
would accordingly “abandon the care we have traditionally
taken to construe such words in their particular statutory
context.” Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini,
Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., 559 U.S.
573, 585 (2010). And, as explained above, the FCA’s
scienter standards are plainly satisfied by a defendant’s
conscious belief that his claims are false.

															Second, Safeco did not purport to set
forth the purely objective safe harbor that respondents invoke. To
the contrary, Safeco stated that a person is reckless if he
acts “knowing or having reason to know of facts which
would lead a reasonable man to realize” that his actions were
substantially risky. 551 U. S., at 69 (emphasis added;
internal quotation marks omitted). Or, as Safeco
alternatively put it, the common law of recklessness
contained an objective standard because it encompassed
actions involving “an unjustifiably high risk of harm that is
either known or so obvious that it should be
known.” Id., at 68 (emphasis added; internal quotation
marks omitted); see also Restatement (Second) of Torts §500,
Comment a (1964) (“Recklessness may consist of either
of two different types of conduct. In one the actor knows
. . . of facts which create a high degree of
risk”). Thus, as we have stated previously, “[n]othing
in Safeco suggests that we should look to facts that the
defendant neither knew nor had reason to know at the time he
acted.” Halo Electronics, 579 U. S., at
106.[6] By a similar token
here, we do not look to legal interpretations that respondents did
not believe or have reason to believe at the time they submitted
their claims.

															3

															Respondents make one more argument,
approaching the issue from a somewhat different angle. They contend
that, at common law, their claims would not be actionable as
fraudulent even if their reported prices were not accurate under
the correct meaning of “usual and customary.” Their
argument is as follows: At common law, misrepresentations of law
are not actionable; only misrepresentations of fact are. Because
the FCA incorporates the common law of fraud, it embodies that same
limitation. And the claims here would have been knowingly false
only because respondents correctly understood what “usual and
customary” meant. Therefore, respondents conclude, their
reports were not false because of any misrepresentation of fact; to
the contrary, their claims would have been false only because of
their view of the law.

															But those premises do not support that
conclusion. To be sure, many courts appear to have stated—as
a general rule—that misrepresentations of law are not
actionable at common law. See Restatement (Second) of Torts
§545; W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser
and Keeton on Law of Torts §109, pp. 758–759 (5th
ed. 1984) (Prosser & Keeton). So, for example, if a defendant
had told the plaintiff, “your claim will be dismissed because
federal courts lack jurisdiction over claims like that,” that
representation might not be actionable as a fraud. See
ibid.; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Federal Ins.
Co., 983 F.2d 1549, 1556 (CA10 1993). Varying rationales appear
to have been given for this rule, including that such statements
are of mere opinion and that no one could justifiably rely on them.
See Dobbs §677, at 688.

															For purposes of these cases, we assume without
deciding that the FCA incorporates some version of this rule; even
then, the rule has significant limits on its own terms. As relevant
here, statements involving some legal analysis remain actionable if
they “carry with [them] by implication” an assertion
about “facts that justify” the speaker’s
statement. Restatement (Second) of Torts §545, Comment
c; see also Prosser & Keeton §109, at 759. So, as a
contrasting example, a person might be liable for falsely stating
that “the plumbing work that I did on your house complied
with state law.” See Sorenson v. Gardner, 215
Ore. 255, 261, 334 P.2d 471, 474 (1959). That is because such a
statement says something about both the correct meaning of building
codes and the facts about the home’s construction.
Ibid.; see also Hoyt Properties, Inc. v.
Production Resource Group, L. L. C., 736 N.W.2d
313, 319 (Minn. 2007). And homeowners might justifiably rely on
that latter representation about the facts, which thus could be
actionable as fraud.

															Respondents’ disclosures here sound more
like our hypothetical plumber, not our hypothetical legal advisor.
Rather than saying, “this is what ‛usual and
customary’ means,” respondents essentially said,
“this is what our ‛usual and customary’
prices are.” In doing so, they plainly implied facts about
their prices that were not known to the plan sponsors, pharmacy
benefit managers, and state Medicaid agencies that received their
claims. Petitioners’ cases thus make out a valid fraud theory
even under respondents’ common-law rule.

															*  *  *

															Under the FCA, petitioners may establish
scienter by showing that respondents (1) actually knew that their
reported prices were not their “usual and customary”
prices when they reported those prices, (2) were aware of a
substantial risk that their higher, retail prices were not their
“usual and customary” prices and intentionally avoided
learning whether their reports were accurate, or (3) were aware of
such a substantial and unjustifiable risk but submitted the claims
anyway. §3729(b)(1)(A). If petitioners can make that showing,
then it does not matter whether some other, objectively reasonable
interpretation of “usual and customary” would point to
respondents’ higher prices. For scienter, it is enough if
respondents believed that their claims were not accurate.

															We need not address any of the other factual or
legal disputes involved in these cases, including whether
petitioners have made a showing sufficient under the correct legal
standard to preclude summary judgment. Nor do we need to address
any of the parties’ policy arguments, which “cannot
supersede the clear statutory text.” Escobar, 579
U. S., at 192. We accordingly vacate the judgments below and
remand these cases to the Seventh Circuit for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 The FCA covers claims
presented both to the Federal Government and to a federal
“contractor, grantee, or other recipient” when, as
relevant here, the money is “to be spent or used
. . . to advance a Government program.” 31
U. S. C. §3729(b)(2)(A).
2
 Respondents, of course,
demur and portray themselves in a far more sympathetic light. We do
not resolve any of those factual disputes today, as we resolve only
a legal question arising from the grant of summary judgment to
respondents. In this posture, we must take the evidence in
petitioners’ favor.
3
 The FCA also specifies
that the term “ ‘knowingly’ . . .
require[s] no proof of specific intent to defraud.”
§3729(b)(1)(B).
4
 Respondents contend that
“information” can refer only to purely factual
information, like the number of drugs sold. But the definition of
“information” is broad, referring to all
“knowledge obtained from investigation, study, or
instruction.” See Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary
592 (1975); see also American Heritage Dictionary 674–675
(1981). And, in this context, the scienter requirement of the FCA
is plainly directed to the falsity of the claims submitted.
§3729(a)(1)(A).

 In some civil contexts, a
defendant may be called “reckless” for acting in the
face of an unjustifiably high risk of illegality that was so
obvious that it should have been known, even if the defendant was
not actually conscious of that risk. See Farmer, 511
U. S., at 836–837. We need not consider how (or whether)
that objective form of “recklessness” relates to the
FCA today because, as noted above, it is enough to say that the
FCA’s standards can be satisfied by a defendant’s
subjective awareness of the claim’s falsity or an
unjustifiable risk of such falsity.

 Respondents read a
footnote in Safeco to establish the sort of purely objective
safe harbor for which they argue. See Safeco, 551
U. S., at 70, n. 20. But that footnote—even if it
does deem subjective intent to be irrelevant in the FCRA
context—certainly was not meant to establish the general rule
for the terms “knowing” or “reckless” in
all contexts. Cf. Halo Electronics, 579 U. S., at 106,
n. (distinguishing the footnote in the patent-infringement
context).
