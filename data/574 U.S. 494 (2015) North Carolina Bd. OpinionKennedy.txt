															NORTH CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF DENTAL EXAMINERS, PETITIONER
v. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the fourth circuit

															[February 25, 2015]

															Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

															This case arises from an antitrust challenge to the actions of a
state regulatory board. A majority of the
boardâ€™s members are engaged in the active
practice of the profession it regulates. The question is whether
the boardâ€™s actions are protected from Sherman
Act regulation under the doctrine of state-action antitrust
immunity, as defined and applied in this
Courtâ€™s decisions beginning with Parker
v. Brown,317 U.Â S. 341 (1943).

															I

															A

															In its Dental Practice Act (Act), North Carolina has declared
the practice of dentistry to be a matter of public concern
requiring regulation. N.Â C. Gen. Stat. Ann.
Â§90â€“22(a) (2013). Under the Act,
the North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners (Board) is
â€œthe agency of the State for the regulation of
the practice of dentistry.â€
Â§90â€“22(b).

															The Boardâ€™s principal duty is to create,
administer, and enforce a licensing system for dentists. See
Â§Â§90â€“29 to
90â€“41. To perform that function it has broad
authority over licensees. See
Â§90â€“41. The
Boardâ€™s authority with respect to unlicensed
persons, however, is more restricted: like â€œany
resident citizen,â€ the Board may file suit to
â€œperpetually enjoin any person from
.Â .Â . unlawfully practicing
dentistry.â€
Â§90â€“40.1.

															The Act provides that six of the Boardâ€™s
eight members must be licensed dentists engaged in the active
practice of dentistry. Â§90â€“22. They
are elected by other licensed dentists in North Carolina, who cast
their ballots in elections conducted by the Board. Ibid. The
seventh member must be a licensed and practicing dental hygienist,
and he or she is elected by other licensed hygienists. Ibid.
The final member is referred to by the Act as a
â€œconsumerâ€ and is appointed by the
Governor. Ibid. All members serve 3-year terms, and no
person may serve more than two consecutive terms. Ibid. The
Act does not create any mechanism for the removal of an elected
member of the Board by a public official. See ibid.

															Board members swear an oath of office,
Â§138Aâ€“22(a), and the Board must
comply with the Stateâ€™s Administrative
Procedure Act, Â§150Bâ€“1
etÂ seq., Public Records Act,
Â§132â€“1 etÂ seq.,
and open-meetings law, Â§143â€“318.9
etÂ seq. The Board may promulgate rules and
regulations governing the practice of dentistry within the State,
provided those mandates are not inconsistent with the Act and are
approved by the North Carolina Rules Review Commission, whose
members are appointed by the state legislature. See
Â§Â§90â€“48,
143Bâ€“30.1,
150Bâ€“21.9(a).

															B

															In the 1990â€™s, dentists in North Carolina
started whitening teeth. Many of those who did so, including 8 of
the Boardâ€™s 10 members during the period at
issue in this case, earned substantial fees for that service. By
2003, nondentists arrived on the scene. They charged lower prices
for their services than the dentists did. Dentists soon began to
complain to the Board about their new competitors. Few complaints
warned of possible harm to consumers. Most expressed a principal
concern with the low prices charged by nondentists.

															Responding to these filings, the Board opened an investigation
into nondentist teeth whitening. A dentist member was placed in
charge of the inquiry. Neither the Boardâ€™s
hygienist member nor its consumer member participated in this
undertaking. The Boardâ€™s chief operations
officer remarked that the Board was â€œgoing forth
to do battleâ€ with nondentists. App. to Pet. for Cert.
103a. The Boardâ€™s concern did not result in a
formal rule or regulation reviewable by the independent Rules
Review Commission, even though the Act does not, by its terms,
specify that teeth whitening is â€œthe practice of
dentistry.â€

															Starting in 2006, the Board issued at least 47 cease-and-desist
letters on its official letterhead to nondentist teeth whitening
service providers and product manufacturers. Many of those letters
directed the recipient to cease â€œall activity
constituting the practice of dentistryâ€; warned that
the unlicensed practice of dentistry is a crime; and strongly
implied (or expressly stated) that teeth whitening constitutes
â€œthe practice of dentistry.â€ App.
13, 15. In early 2007, the Board persuaded the North Carolina Board
of Cosmetic Art Examiners to warn cosmetologists against providing
teeth whitening services. Later that year, the Board sent letters
to mall operators, stating that kiosk teeth whiteners were
violating the Dental Practice Act and advising that the malls
consider expelling violators from their premises.

															These actions had the intended result. Nondentists ceased
offering teeth whitening services in North Carolina.

															C

															In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an
administrative complaint charging the Board with violating
Â§5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,38Stat.719, as
amended,15 U.Â S.Â C. Â§45. The
FTC alleged that the Boardâ€™s concerted action
to exclude nondentists from the market for teeth whitening services
in North Carolina constituted an anticompetitive and unfair method
of competition. The Board moved to dismiss, alleging state-action
immunity. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) denied the motion. On
appeal, the FTC sustained the ALJâ€™s ruling. It
reasoned that, even assuming the Board had acted pursuant to a
clearly articulated state policy to displace competition, the Board
is a â€œpublic/private hybridâ€ that
must be actively supervised by the State to claim immunity. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 49a. The FTC further concluded the Board could not
make that showing.

															Following other proceedings not relevant here, the ALJ conducted
a hearing on the merits and determined the Board had unreasonably
restrained trade in violation of antitrust law. On appeal, the FTC
again sustained the ALJ. The FTC rejected the
Boardâ€™s public safety justification, noting,
inter alia, â€œa wealth of evidence
.Â .Â . suggesting that non-dentist provided
teeth whitening is a safe cosmetic procedure.â€
Id., at 123a.

															The FTC ordered the Board to stop sending the cease-and-desist
letters or other communications that stated nondentists may not
offer teeth whitening services and products. It further ordered the
Board to issue notices to all earlier recipients of the
Boardâ€™s cease-and-desist orders advising them
of the Boardâ€™s proper sphere of authority and
saying, among other options, that the notice recipients had a right
to seek declaratory rulings in state court.

															On petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit affirmed the FTC in all respects. 717 F.Â 3d
359, 370 (2013). This Court granted certiorari. 571
U.Â S. ___ (2014).

															II

															Federal antitrust law is a central safeguard for the
Nationâ€™s free market structures. In this regard
it is â€œas important to the preservation of
economic freedom and our free-enterprise system as the Bill of
Rights is to the protection of our fundamental personal
freedoms.â€ United States v. Topco
Associates, Inc.,405 U.Â S. 596,610 (1972). The
antitrust laws declare a considered and decisive prohibition by the
Federal Government of cartels, price fixing, and other combinations
or practices that undermine the free market.

															The Sherman Act,26Stat.209, as amended,15
U.Â S.Â C. Â§1
etÂ seq., serves to promote robust competition,
which in turn empowers the States and provides their citizens with
opportunities to pursue their own and the
publicâ€™s welfare. See FTC v. Ticor
Title Ins. Co.,504 U.Â S. 621,632 (1992). The
States, however, when acting in their respective realm, need not
adhere in all contexts to a model of unfettered competition. While
â€œthe States regulate their economies in many
ways not inconsistent with the antitrust laws,â€
id., at 635â€“636, in some spheres they
impose restrictions on occupations, confer exclusive or shared
rights to dominate a market, or otherwise limit competition to
achieve public objectives. If every duly enacted state law or
policy were required to conform to the mandates of the Sherman Act,
thus promoting competition at the expense of other values a State
may deem fundamental, federal antitrust law would impose an
impermissible burden on the Statesâ€™ power to
regulate. See Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland,437
U.Â S. 117,133 (1978); see also Easterbrook, Antitrust
and the Economics of Federalism, 26 J.Â Law & Econ.
23, 24 (1983).

															For these reasons, the Court in Parker v. Brown
interpreted the antitrust laws to confer immunity on
anticompetitive conduct by the States when acting in their
sovereign capacity. See 317 U.Â S., at
350â€“351. That ruling recognized
Congressâ€™ purpose to respect the federal
balance and to â€œembody in the Sherman Act the
federalism principle that the States possess a significant measure
of sovereignty under our Constitution.â€ Community
Communications Co. v. Boulder,455 U.Â S.
40,53 (1982). Since 1943, the Court has reaffirmed the importance
of Parkerâ€™s central holding. See,
e.g., Ticor, supra, at 632â€“637;
Hoover v. Ronwin,466 U.Â S. 558,568
(1984); Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light
Co.,435 U.Â S. 389â€“400
(1978).

															III

															In this case the Board argues its members were invested by North
Carolina with the power of the State and that, as a result, the
Boardâ€™s actions are cloaked with Parker
immunity. This argument fails, however. A nonsovereign actor
controlled by active market participantsâ€”such
as the Boardâ€”enjoys Parker immunity only
if it satisfies two requirements: â€œfirst that
â€˜the challenged restraint
.Â .Â . be one clearly articulated and
affirmatively expressed as state policy,â€™ and
second that â€˜the policy . . . be actively
supervised by the
State.â€™Â â€ FTC
v. Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc., 568 U.Â S.
___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7) (quoting California Retail
Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445
U.Â S. 97,105 (1980)). The parties have assumed that the
clear articulation requirement is satisfied, and we do the same.
While North Carolina prohibits the unauthorized practice of
dentistry, however, its Act is silent on whether that broad
prohibition covers teeth whitening. Here, the Board did not receive
active super-vision by the State when it interpreted the Act as
ad-dressing teeth whitening and when it enforced that policy by
issuing cease-and-desist letters to nondentist teeth whiteners.

															A

															Although state-action immunity exists to avoid conflicts between
state sovereignty and the Nationâ€™s commitment
to a policy of robust competition, Parker immunity is not
unbounded. â€œ[G]iven the fundamental national
values of free enterprise and economic competition that are
embodied in the federal antitrust laws, â€˜state
action immunity is disfavored, much as are repeals by
implication.â€™Â â€
Phoebe Putney, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7)
(quoting Ticor, supra, at 636).

															An entity may not invoke Parker immunity unless the
actions in question are an exercise of the
Stateâ€™s sovereign power. See Columbia v.
Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc.,499 U.Â S. 365,374
(1991). State legislation and â€œdecision[s] of a
state supreme court, acting legislatively rather than
judicially,â€ will satisfy this standard, and
â€œipso facto are exempt from the operation
of the antitrust lawsâ€ because they are an undoubted
exercise of state sovereign authority. Hoover, supra,
at 567â€“568.

															But while the Sherman Act confers immunity on the
Statesâ€™ own anticompetitive policies out of
respect for federalism, it does not always confer immunity where,
as here, a State delegates control over a market to a non-sovereign
actor. See Parker, supra, at 351
(â€œ[A] state does not give immunity to those who
violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by
declaring that their action is lawfulâ€). For purposes
of Parker, a nonsovereign actor is one whose conduct does
not automatically qualify as that of the sovereign State itself.
See Hoover, supra, at 567â€“568.
State agencies are not simply by their governmental character
sovereign actors for purposes of state-action immunity. See
Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar,421 U.Â S.
773,791 (1975) (â€œThe fact that the State Bar is
a state agency for some limited purposes does not create an
antitrust shield that allows it to foster anticompetitive practices
for the benefit of its membersâ€). Immunity for state
agencies, therefore, requires more than a mere facade of state
involvement, for it is necessary in light of
Parkerâ€™s rationale to ensure the States
accept political accountability for anticompetitive conduct they
permit and control. See Ticor, 504 U.Â S., at
636.

															Limits on state-action immunity are most essential when the
State seeks to delegate its regulatory power to active market
participants, for established ethical standards may blend with
private anticompetitive motives in a way difficult even for market
participants to discern. Dual allegiances are not always apparent
to an actor. In consequence, active market participants cannot be
allowed to regulate their own markets free from antitrust
account-ability. See Midcal, supra, at 106
(â€œThe national policy in favor of competition
cannot be thwarted by casting [a] gauzy cloak of state involvement
over what is essentially a private price-fixing
arrangementâ€). Indeed, prohibitions against
anticompetitive self-regulation by active market participants are
an axiom of federal antitrust policy. See, e.g., Allied
Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc.,486
U.Â S. 492,501 (1988); Hoover, supra, at
584 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (â€œThe risk that
private regulation of market entry, prices, or output may be
designed to confer monop-oly profits on members of an industry at
the expense of the consuming public has been the central concern of
.Â .Â . our antitrust
jurisprudenceâ€); see also Elhauge, The Scope of
Antitrust Process, 104 Harv. L.Â Rev. 667, 672 (1991).
So it follows that, under Parker and the Supremacy Clause,
the Statesâ€™ greater power to attain an end does
not include the lesser power to negate the congressional judgment
embodied in the Sherman Act through unsupervised delegations to
active market participants. See Garland, Antitrust and State
Action: Economic Efficiency and the Political Process, 96 Yale
L.Â J. 486, 500 (1986).

															Parker immunity requires that the anticompetitive conduct
of nonsovereign actors, especially those authorized by the State to
regulate their own profession, result from procedures that suffice
to make it the Stateâ€™s own. See Goldfarb,
supra, at 790; see also 1A P. Areeda & H. Hovencamp,
Antitrust Law Â¶226, p. 180 (4th ed. 2013) (Areeda &
Hovencamp). The question is not whether the challenged conduct is
efficient, well-functioning, or wise. See Ticor,
supra, at 634â€“635. Rather, it is
â€œwhether anticompetitive conduct engaged in by
[nonsovereign actors] should be deemed state action and thus
shielded from the antitrust laws.â€ Patrick v.
Burget,486 U.Â S. 94,100 (1988).

															To answer this question, the Court applies the two-part test set
forth in California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal
Aluminum, Inc.,445 U.Â S. 97, a case arising from
Californiaâ€™s delegation of price-fixing
authority to wine merchants. Under Midcal,
â€œ[a] state law or regulatory scheme cannot be
the basis for antitrust immunity unless, first, the State has
articulated a clear policy to allow the anticompetitive conduct,
and second, the State provides active supervision of [the]
anticompetitive conduct.â€ Ticor, supra,
at 631 (citing Midcal, supra, at 105).

															Midcalâ€™s clear articulation
requirement is satisfied â€œwhere the displacement
of competition [is] the inherent, logical, or ordinary result of
the exercise of authority delegated by the state legislature. In
that scenario, the State must have foreseen and implicitly endorsed
the anticompetitive effects as consistent with its policy
goals.â€ Phoebe Putney, 568 U.Â S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 11). The active supervision requirement
demands, inter alia, â€œthat state
officials have and exercise power to review particular
anticompetitive acts of private parties and disapprove those that
fail to accord with state policy.â€ Patrick,
supra, U.Â S., at 101.

															The two requirements set forth in Midcal provide a proper
analytical framework to resolve the ultimate question whether an
anticompetitive policy is indeed the policy of a State. The first
requirementâ€”clear
articulationâ€”rarely will achieve that goal by
itself, for a policy may satisfy this test yet still be defined at
so high a level of generality as to leave open critical questions
about how and to what extent the market should be regulated. See
Ticor, supra, at 636â€“637.
Entities purporting to act under state authority might diverge from
the Stateâ€™s considered definition of the public
good. The resulting asymmetry between a state policy and its
implementation can invite private self-dealing. The second
Midcal requirementâ€”active
supervisionâ€”seeks to avoid this harm by
requiring the State to review and approve interstitial policies
made by the entity claiming immunity.

															Midcalâ€™s supervision rule
â€œstems from the recognition that
â€˜[w]here a private party is engaging in
anticompetitive activity, there is a real danger that he is acting
to further his own interests, rather than the governmental
interests of the
State.â€™Â â€
Patrick, supra, at 100. Concern about the private
incentives of active market participants animates
Midcalâ€™s supervision mandate, which
demands â€œrealistic assurance that a private
partyâ€™s anticompetitive conduct promotes state
policy, rather than merely the partyâ€™s
individual interests.â€ Patrick, supra,
at 101.

															B

															In determining whether anticompetitive policies and conduct are
indeed the action of a State in its sovereign capacity, there are
instances in which an actor can be excused from
Midcalâ€™s active supervision requirement.
In Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U.Â S.
34, 45 (1985), the Court held municipalities are subject
exclusively to Midcalâ€™s
â€œÂ â€˜clear
articulationâ€™Â â€
requirement. That rule, the Court observed, is consistent with the
objective of ensuring that the policy at issue be one enacted by
the State itself. Hallie explained that
â€œ[w]here the actor is a municipality, there is
little or no danger that it is involved in a private price-fixing
arrangement. The only real danger is that it will seek to further
purely parochial public interests at the expense of more overriding
state goals.â€ 471 U.Â S., at 47.
Hallie further observed that municipalities are electorally
accountable and lack the kind of private incentives characteristic
of active participants in the market. See id., at 45,
n.Â 9. Critically, the municipality in Hallie
exercised a wide range of governmental powers across different
economic spheres, substantially reducing the risk that it would
pursue private interests while regulating any single field. See
ibid. That Hallie excused municipalities from
Midcalâ€™s supervision rule for these
reasons all but confirms the ruleâ€™s
applicability to actors controlled by active market participants,
who ordinarily have none of the features justifying the narrow
exception Hallie identified. See 471 U. S., at 45.

															Following Goldfarb, Midcal, and Hallie,
which clarified the conditions under which Parker immunity
attaches to the conduct of a nonsovereign actor, the Court in
Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc.,499
U.Â S. 365, addressed whether an otherwise immune entity
could lose immunity for conspiring with private parties. In
Omni, an aspiring billboard merchant argued that the city of
Columbia, South Carolina, had violated the Sherman
Actâ€”and forfeited its Parker
immunityâ€”by anticompetitively conspiring with
an established local company in passing an ordinance restricting
new billboard construction. 499 U.Â S., at
367â€“368. The Court disagreed, holding there is
no â€œconspiracy exceptionâ€ to
Parker. Omni, supra, at 374.

															Omni, like the cases before it, recognized the importance
of drawing a line â€œrelevant to the purposes of
the Sherman Act and of Parker: prohibiting the restriction
of competition for private gain but permitting the restriction of
competition in the public interest.â€ 499
U.Â S., at 378. In the context of a municipal actor
which, as in Hallie, exercised substantial governmental
powers, Omni rejected a conspiracy exception for
â€œcorruptionâ€ as vague and
unworkable, since â€œvirtually all regulation
benefits some segments of the society and harms
othersâ€ and may in that sense be seen as
â€œÂ â€˜corrupt.â€™Â â€
499 U.Â S., at 377. Omni also rejected subjective
tests for corruption that would force a
â€œdeconstruction of the governmental process and
probing of the official
â€˜intentâ€™ that we have
consistently sought to avoid.â€ Ibid. Thus,
whereas the cases preceding it addressed the preconditions of
Parker immunity and engaged in an objective, ex ante
inquiry into nonsovereign actorsâ€™ structure and
incentives, Omni made clear that recipients of immunity will
not lose it on the basis of adÂ hoc and
exÂ post questioning of their motives for making
particular decisions.

															Omniâ€™s holding makes it all the more
necessary to ensure the conditions for granting immunity are met in
the first place. The Courtâ€™s two state-action
immunity cases decided after Omni reinforce this point. In
Ticor the Court affirmed that
Midcalâ€™s limits on delegation must
ensure that â€œ[a]ctual state involvement, not
deference to private price-fixing arrangements under the general
auspices of state law, is the precondition for immunity from
federal law.â€ 504 U.Â S., at 633. And in
Phoebe Putney the Court observed that
Midcalâ€™s active supervision requirement,
in particular, is an essential condition of state-action immunity
when a nonsovereign actor has â€œan incentive to
pursue [its] own self-interest under the guise of implementing
state policies.â€ 568 U.Â S., at ___ (slip
op., at 8) (quoting Hallie, supra, at
46â€“47). The lesson is clear:
Midcalâ€™s active supervision test is an
essential prerequisite of Parker immunity for any
nonsovereign entityâ€”public or
privateâ€”controlled by active market
participants.

															C

															The Board argues entities designated by the States as agencies
are exempt from Midcalâ€™s second
requirement. That premise, however, cannot be reconciled with the
Courtâ€™s repeated conclusion that the need for
supervision turns not on the formal designation given by States to
regulators but on the risk that active market participants will
pursue private interests in restraining trade.

															State agencies controlled by active market participants, who
possess singularly strong private interests, pose the very risk of
self-dealing Midcalâ€™s supervision
requirement was created to address. See Areeda & Hovencamp
Â¶227, at 226. This conclusion does not question the
good faith of state officers but rather is an assessment of the
structural risk of market participantsâ€™
confusing their own interests with the Stateâ€™s
policy goals. See Patrick, 486 U.Â S., at
100â€“101.

															The Court applied this reasoning to a state agency in
Goldfarb. There the Court denied immunity to a state agency
(the Virginia State Bar) controlled by market participants
(lawyers) because the agency had â€œjoined in what
is essentially a private anticompetitive activityâ€ for
â€œthe benefit of its members.â€ 421
U.Â S., at 791, 792. This emphasis on the
Barâ€™s private interests explains why
Goldfarb, though it predates Midcal, considered the
lack of supervision by the Virginia Supreme Court to be a principal
reason for denying immunity. See 421 U.Â S., at 791; see
also Hoover, 466 U.Â S., at 569 (emphasizing lack
of active supervision in Goldfarb); Bates v. State
Bar of Ariz.,433 U.Â S. 350â€“362
(1977) (granting the Arizona Bar state-action immunity partly
because its â€œrules are subject to pointed
re-examination by the policymakerâ€).

															While Hallie stated â€œit is likely that
active state supervision would also not be requiredâ€
for agencies, 471 U.Â S., at 46, n.Â 10, the
entity there, as was later the case in Omni, was an
electorally accountable municipality with general regulatory powers
and no private price-fixing agenda. In that and other respects the
municipality was more like prototypical state agencies, not
specialized boards dominated by active market participants. In
important regards, agencies controlled by market participants are
more similar to private trade associations vested by States with
regulatory authority than to the agencies Hallie considered.
And as the Court observed three years after Hallie,
â€œ[t]here is no doubt that the members of such
associations often have economic incentives to restrain competition
and that the product standards set by such associations have a
serious potential for anticompetitive harm.â€ Allied
Tube, 486 U.Â S., at 500. For that reason, those
associations must satisfy Midcalâ€™s
active supervision standard. See Midcal, 445
U.Â S., at 105â€“106.

															The similarities between agencies controlled by active market
participants and private trade associations are not eliminated
simply because the former are given a formal designation by the
State, vested with a measure of government power, and required to
follow some procedural rules. See Hallie, supra, at
39 (rejecting â€œpurely formalisticâ€
analysis). Parker immunity does not derive from nomenclature
alone. When a State empowers a group of active market participants
to decide who can participate in its market, and on what terms, the
need for supervision is manifest. See Areeda & Hovencamp
Â¶227, at 226. The Court holds today that a state board
on which a controlling number of decisionmakers are active market
participants in the occupation the board regulates must satisfy
Midcalâ€™s active supervision requirement
in order to invoke state-action antitrust immunity.

															D

															The State argues that allowing this FTC order to stand will
discourage dedicated citizens from serving on state agencies that
regulate their own occupation. If this were
soâ€”and, for reasons to be noted, it need not be
soâ€”there would be some cause for concern. The
States have a sovereign interest in structuring their governments,
see Gregory v. Ashcroft,501 U.Â S. 452,460
(1991), and may conclude there are substantial benefits to staffing
their agencies with experts in complex and technical subjects, see
Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United
States,471 U.Â S. 48,64 (1985). There is, moreover,
a long tradition of citizens esteemed by their professional
colleagues devoting time, energy, and talent to enhancing the
dignity of their calling.

															Adherence to the idea that those who pursue a calling must
embrace ethical standards that derive from a duty separate from the
dictates of the State reaches back at least to the Hippocratic
Oath. See generally S. Miles, The Hippocratic Oath and the Ethics
of Medicine (2004). In the United States, there is a strong
tradition of professional self-regulation, particularly with
respect to the development of ethical rules. See generally R.
Rotunda & J. Dzienkowski, Legal Ethics: The
Lawyerâ€™s Deskbook on Professional
Responsibility (2014); R. Baker, Before Bioethics: A History of
American Medical Ethics From the Colonial Period to the Bioethics
Revolution (2013). Dentists are no exception. The American Dental
Association, for example, in an exercise of â€œthe
privilege and obligation of self-government,â€ has
â€œcall[ed] upon dentists to follow high ethical
standards,â€ including â€œhonesty,
compassion, kindness, integrity, fairness and
charity.â€ American Dental Association, Principles of
Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct 3â€“4
(2012). State laws and institutions are sustained by this tradition
when they draw upon the expertise and commitment of
professionals.

															Todayâ€™s holding is not inconsistent with
that idea. The Board argues, however, that the potential for money
damages will discourage members of regulated occupations from
participating in state government. Cf. Filarsky v.
Delia, 566 U.Â S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at
12) (warning in the context of civil rights suits that the
â€œthe most talented candidates will decline
public engagements if they do not receive the same immunity enjoyed
by their public employee counterpartsâ€). But this
case, which does not present a claim for money damages, does not
offer occasion to address the question whether agency officials,
including board members, may, under some circumstances, enjoy
immunity from damages liability. See Goldfarb, 421
U.Â S., at 792, n. 22; see also Brief for Respondent 56.
And, of course, the States may provide for the defense and
indemnification of agency members in the event of litigation.

															States, furthermore, can ensure Parker immunity is
available to agencies by adopting clear policies to displace
competition; and, if agencies controlled by active market
participants interpret or enforce those policies, the States may
provide active supervision. Precedent confirms this principle. The
Court has rejected the argument that it would be unwise to apply
the antitrust laws to professional regulation absent compliance
with the prerequisites for invoking Parker immunity:

															â€œ[Respondents] contend that effective peer
review is essential to the provision of quality medical care and
that any threat of antitrust liability will prevent physicians from
participating openly and actively in peer-review proceedings. This
argument, however, essentially challenges the wisdom of applying
the antitrust laws to the sphere of medical care, and as such is
properly directed to the legislative branch. To the extent that
Congress has declined to exempt medical peer review from the reach
of the antitrust laws, peer review is immune from antitrust
scrutiny only if the State effectively has made this conduct its
own.â€ Patrick, 486 U.Â S. at
105â€“106 (footnote omitted).

															The reasoning of Patrick v. Burget applies to this
case with full force, particularly in light of the risks licensing
boards dominated by market participants may pose to the free
market. See generally Edlin & Haw, Cartels by Another Name:
Should Licensed Occupations Face Antitrust Scrutiny? 162
U.Â Pa. L.Â Rev. 1093 (2014).

															The Board does not contend in this Court that its
anticompetitive conduct was actively supervised by the State or
that it should receive Parker immunity on that basis.

															By statute, North Carolina delegates control over the practice
of dentistry to the Board. The Act, however, says nothing about
teeth whitening, a practice that did not exist when it was passed.
After receiving complaints from other dentists about the
nondentistsâ€™ cheaper services, the
Boardâ€™s dentist
membersâ€”some of whom offered whitening
servicesâ€”acted to expel the
dentistsâ€™ competitors from the market. In so
doing the Board relied upon cease-and-desist letters threatening
criminal liability, rather than any of the powers at its disposal
that would invoke oversight by a politically accountable official.
With no active supervision by the State, North Carolina officials
may well have been unaware that the Board had decided teeth
whitening constitutes â€œthe practice of
dentistryâ€ and sought to prohibit those who competed
against dentists from participating in the teeth whitening market.
Whether or not the Board exceeded its powers under North Carolina
law, cf. Omni, 499 U.Â S., at
371â€“372, there is no evidence here of any
decision by the State to initiate or concur with the
Boardâ€™s actions against the nondentists.

															IV

															The Board does not claim that the State exercised active, or
indeed any, supervision over its conduct regarding nondentist teeth
whiteners; and, as a result, no specific supervisory systems can be
reviewed here. It suffices to note that the inquiry regarding
active supervision is flexible and context-dependent. Active
supervision need not entail day-to-day involvement in an
agencyâ€™s operations or micromanagement of its
every decision. Rather, the question is whether the
Stateâ€™s review mechanisms provide
â€œrealistic assuranceâ€ that a
nonsovereign actorâ€™s anticompetitive conduct
â€œpromotes state policy, rather than merely the
partyâ€™s individual interests.â€
Patrick, supra, at 100â€“101; see
also Ticor, 504 U.Â S., at
639â€“640.

															The Court has identified only a few constant requirements of
active supervision: The supervisor must review the substance of the
anticompetitive decision, not merely the procedures followed to
produce it, see Patrick, 486 U.Â S., at
102â€“103; the supervisor must have the power to
veto or modify particular decisions to ensure they accord with
state policy, see ibid.; and the â€œmere
potential for state supervision is not an adequate substitute for a
decision by the State,â€ Ticor, supra, at
638. Further, the state supervisor may not itself be an active
market participant. In general, however, the adequacy of
supervision otherwise will depend on all the circumstances of a
case.

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															The Sherman Act protects competition while also respecting
federalism. It does not authorize the States to abandon markets to
the unsupervised control of active market participants, whether
trade associations or hybrid agencies. If a State wants to rely on
active market participants as regulators, it must provide active
supervision if state-action immunity under Parker is to be
invoked.

															The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is
affirmed.

															It is so ordered.
