															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full.  I write separately to add that the employees also cannot prevail under the plain meaning of the Federal Arbitration Act.  The Act declares arbitration agreements “valid, irrevocable, and enforce- able, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.”

9 U. S. C. §2.  As I have previously explained, grounds for revocation of a contract are those that concern “ ‘the formation of the arbitration agreement.’ ”  American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant,

570 U. S. 228, 239 (2013) (concurring opinion) (quoting AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion,

563 U. S. 333, 353 (2011) (Thomas, J., concurring)).  The employees argue, among other things, that the class waivers in their arbitration agreements are unenforceable because the National Labor Relations Act makes those waivers illegal.  But illegality is a public-policy defense.  See Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§178–179 (1979); McMullen v. Hoffman,

174 U. S. 639, 669–670 (1899).  Because “[r]efusal to enforce a contract for public-policy reasons does not concern whether the contract was properly made,” the saving clause does not apply here.  Concepcion, supra, at 357.  For this reason, and the reasons in the Court’s opinion, the employees’ arbitration agreements must be enforced according to their terms.
