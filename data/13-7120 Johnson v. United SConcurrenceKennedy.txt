															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															SAMUEL JAMES JOHNSON, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[June 26, 2015]

															

															Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.

															In my view, and for the reasons well stated by Justice Alito in dissent, the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act is not unconstitutionally vague under the categorical approach or a record-based approach.  On the assumption that the categorical approach ought to still control, and for the reasons given by Justice Thomas in Part I of his opinion concurring in the judgment, Johnson’s conviction for possession of a short-barreled shotgun does not qualify as a violent felony.

															For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.
