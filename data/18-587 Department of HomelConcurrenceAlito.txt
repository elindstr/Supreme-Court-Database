															Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

															Anyone interested in the role that the Federal Judiciary now plays in our constitutional system should consider what has happened in these cases.  Early in the term of the current President, his administration took the controversial step of attempting to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  Shortly thereafter, one of the nearly 700 federal district court judges blocked this rescission, and since then, this issue has been mired in litigation.  In November 2018, the Solicitor General filed petitions for certiorari, and today, the Court still does not resolve the question of DACA’s rescission.  Instead, it tells the Department of Homeland Security to go back and try again.  What this means is that the Federal Judiciary, without holding that DACA cannot be rescinded, has prevented that from occurring during an entire Presidential term.  Our constitutional system is not supposed to work that way.

															I join Justice Thomas’s opinion.  DACA presents a delicate political issue, but that is not our business.  As Justice Thomas explains, DACA was unlawful from the start, and that alone is sufficient to justify its termination.  But even if DACA were lawful, we would still have no basis for overturning its rescission.  First, to the extent DACA represented a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion, its rescission represented an exercise of that same discretion, and it would therefore be unreviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act.

5 U. S. C. §701(a)(2); see Heckler v. Chaney,

470 U.S. 821, 831–832 (1985).  Second, to the extent we could review the rescission, it was not arbitrary and capricious for essentially the reasons explained by Justice Kavanaugh.  See post, at 4–6 (opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).
