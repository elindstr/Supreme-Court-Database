															   Justice Stevens, concurring.

															
   While I join the Court’s opinion in full, I add this caveat concerning Part III–B, which correctly explains why a court of appeals’ interpretation of an ambiguous provision in a regulatory statute does not foreclose a contrary reading by the agency.  That explanation would not necessarily be applicable to a decision by this Court that would presumably remove any pre-existing ambiguity.
