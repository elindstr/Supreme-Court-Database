															LOUIS CIMINELLI, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[May 11, 2023]

															Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															In this case, we must decide whether the Second
Circuit’s longstanding “right to control” theory
of fraud describes a valid basis for liability under the federal
wire fraud statute, which criminalizes the use of interstate wires
for “any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining
money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises.” 18 U. S. C.
§1343. Under the right-to-control theory, a defendant is
guilty of wire fraud if he schemes to deprive the victim of
“potentially valuable economic information”
“necessary to make discretionary economic decisions.”
United States v. Percoco, 13 F. 4th 158, 170
(CA2 2021) (internal quotation marks omitted). Petitioner Louis
Ciminelli was charged with, tried for, and convicted of wire fraud
under this theory. And the Second Circuit affirmed his convictions
on that same basis.

															We have held, however, that the federal fraud
statutes criminalize only schemes to deprive people of traditional
property interests. Cleveland v. United States,
531 U.S.
12, 24 (2000). Because “potentially valuable economic in-
formation” “necessary to make discretionary economic
decisions” is not a traditional property interest, we now
hold that the right-to-control theory is not a valid basis for
liability under §1343. Accordingly, we reverse the Second
Circuit’s judgment.

															I

															This case begins with then-New York Governor
Andrew Cuomo’s “Buffalo Billion” initiative. On
its face, the initiative was administered through Fort Schuyler
Management Corporation, a nonprofit affiliated with the State
University of New York (SUNY) and the SUNY Research Foundation. It
aimed to invest $1 billion in development projects in upstate New
York. Later investigations, however, uncovered a wide-ranging
scheme that involved several of former Governor Cuomo’s
associates, most notably Alain Kaloyeros and Todd Howe. Kaloyeros
was a member of Fort Schuyler’s board of directors and was in
charge of developing project proposals for Buffalo Billion; Howe
was a lobbyist who had deep ties to the Cuomo administration. Each
month, Kaloyeros paid Howe $25,000 in state funds to ensure that
the Cuomo administration gave Kaloyeros a prominent position in
Buffalo Billion.

															Ciminelli had a similar arrangement. His
construction company, LPCiminelli, paid Howe $100,000 to $180,000
each year to help it obtain state-funded jobs. In 2013, Howe and
Kaloyeros devised a scheme whereby Kaloyeros would tailor Fort
Schuyler’s bid process to smooth the way for LPCiminelli to
receive major Buffalo Billion contracts. First, on Kaloyeros’
suggestion, Fort Schuyler established a process for selecting
“preferred developers” that would be given the first
opportunity to negotiate with Fort Schuyler for specific projects.
Then, Kaloyeros, Howe, and Ciminelli jointly developed a set of
requests for proposal (RFPs) that treated unique aspects of
LPCiminelli as qualifications for preferred-developer status. Those
RFPs effectively guaranteed that LPCiminelli would be (and was)
selected as a preferred developer for the Buffalo projects. With
that status in hand, LPCiminelli secured the marquee $750 million
“Riverbend project” in Buffalo.

															After an investigation revealed their scheme,
Ciminelli, Howe, Kaloyeros, and several others were indicted by a
federal grand jury on 18 counts including, as relevant here, wire
fraud in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1343 and
conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of §1349.

															Throughout the grand jury proceedings, trial,
and appeal, the Government relied on the Second Circuit’s
“right to control” theory, under which the Government
can establish wire fraud by showing that the defendant schemed to
deprive a victim of potentially valuable economic information
necessary to make discretionary economic decisions. The
Government’s indictment and trial strategy rested solely on
that theory.[1] And, it
successfully defeated Ciminelli and his codefendants’ motion
to dismiss by relying on that theory. In addition, it successfully
moved the District Court to exclude certain defense evidence as
irrelevant to that theory. The Government also relied on that
theory in its summation to the jury.

															Consistent with the right-to-control theory, the
District Court instructed the jury that the term
“property” in §1343 “includes intangible
interests such as the right to control the use of one’s
assets.” App. 41. The jury could thus find that the
defendants harmed Fort Schuyler’s right to control its assets
if Fort Schuyler was “deprived of potentially valuable
economic information that it would consider valuable in deciding
how to use its assets.” Ibid. The District Court
further defined “economically valuable information” as
“information that affects the victim’s assessment of
the benefits or burdens of a transaction, or relates to the quality
of goods or services received or the economic risks of the
transaction.” Ibid. The jury found Ciminelli guilty of
wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and the District
Court sentenced him to 28 months’ imprisonment followed by 2
years’ supervised release.

															On appeal, Ciminelli challenged the
right-to-control theory, arguing that the right to control
one’s assets is not “property” for purposes of
the wire fraud statute. Defending the wire fraud convictions, the
Government relied solely on the right-to-control theory. The Second
Circuit affirmed the convictions based on its longstanding
right-to-control precedents, holding that, by “rigging the
RFPs to favor their companies, defendants deprived Fort Schuyler of
potentially valuable economic information.” 13 F. 4th,
at 171 (internal quotation marks omitted).

															We granted certiorari to determine whether the
Second Circuit’s right-to-control theory of wire fraud is a
valid basis for liability under 18 U. S. C. §1343.
597 U. S. ___ (2022). And, we now hold that it is not.

															II

															A

															The wire fraud statute criminalizes
“scheme[s] or artifice[s] to defraud, or for obtaining money
or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,
representations, or promises.” §1343. Although the
statute is phrased in the disjunctive, we have consistently
understood the “money or property” requirement to limit
the “scheme or artifice to defraud” element because the
“common understanding” of the words “to
defraud” when the statute was enacted referred “to
wronging one in his property rights.” Cleveland, 531
U. S., at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted).[2] This understanding reflects not only the
original meaning of the text, but also that the fraud statutes do
not vest a general power in “the Federal Government
. . . to enforce (its view of ) integrity in broad
swaths of state and local policymaking.” Kelly v.
United States, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at
12). Instead, these statutes “protec[t] property rights
only.” Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 19. Accordingly,
the Government must prove not only that wire fraud defendants
“engaged in deception,” but also that money or property
was “an object of their fraud.” Kelly, 590
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (alterations omitted).

															Despite these limitations, lower federal courts
for decades interpreted the mail and wire fraud statutes to protect
intangible interests unconnected to traditional property rights.
See Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S.
358, 400 (2010) (recounting how “the Courts of Appeals,
one after another, interpreted the term ‘scheme or artifice
to defraud’ to include deprivations not only of money or
property, but also of intangible rights”). For example,
federal courts held the fraud statutes reached such intangible
interests as the right to “honest services,”
ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted); the right of the
citizenry to an honest election, see United States v.
Girdner, 754 F.2d 877, 880 (CA10 1985); and the right to
privacy, United States v. Louderman, 576 F.2d 1383,
1387 (CA9 1978). In McNally v. United States,
483 U.S.
350 (1987), this Court halted that trend by confining the
federal fraud statutes to their original station, the
“protect[ion of] individual property rights.”
Id., at 359, n. 8. Congress then amended the fraud
statutes “specifically to cover one of the ‘intangible
rights’ that lower courts had protected under [the statutes]
prior to McNally: ‘the intangible right of honest
services.’ ” Cleveland, 531 U. S., at
19–20 (quoting 18 U. S. C. §1346).

															The right-to-control theory applied below first
arose after McNally prevented the Government from basing
federal fraud convictions on harms to intangible interests
unconnected to property. See United States v.
Wallach, 935 F.2d 445, 461–464 (CA2 1991). As
developed by the Second Circuit, the theory holds that,
“[s]ince a defining feature of most property is the right to
control the asset in question,” “the property interests
protected by the wire fraud statute include the interest of a
victim in controlling his or her own assets.” United
States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 40, 48 (2019) (alterations
omitted). Thus, a “cognizable harm occurs where the
defendant’s scheme denies the victim the right to control its
assets by depriving it of information necessary to make
discretionary economic decisions.” United States v.
Binday, 804 F.3d 558, 570 (CA2 2015) (alterations
omitted).[3]

															The right-to-control theory cannot be squared
with the text of the federal fraud statutes, which are
“limited in scope to the protection of property
rights.” McNally, 483 U. S., at 360. The
so-called “right to control” is not an interest that
had “long been recognized as property” when the wire
fraud statute was enacted. Carpenter v. United
States, 484 U.S.
19, 26 (1987). Significantly, when the Second Circuit first
recognized the right-to-control theory in 1991—decades after
the wire fraud statute was enacted and over a century after the
mail fraud statute was enacted—it could cite no authority
that established “potentially valuable economic
information” as a traditionally recognized property interest.
See Wallach, 935 F. 2d, at 462–463.[4] And, the Second Circuit has not since
attempted to ground the right-to-control theory in traditional
property notions. We have consistently rejected such federal fraud
theories that “stray from traditional concepts of
property.” Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 24. For its
part, the Government—despite relying upon the
right-to-control theory for decades, including in this very
case—now concedes that if “the right to make informed
decisions about the disposition of one’s assets, without
more, were treated as the sort of ‘property’ giving
rise to wire fraud, it would risk expanding the federal fraud
statutes beyond property fraud as defined at common law and as
Congress would have understood it.” Brief for United States
25–26. Thus, even the Government now agrees that the Second
Circuit’s right-to-control theory is unmoored from the
federal fraud statutes’ text.

															The right-to-control theory is also inconsistent
with the structure and history of the federal fraud statutes. As
recounted above, after McNally put an end to federal
courts’ use of mail and wire fraud to protect an ever-growing
swath of intangible interests unconnected to property, Congress
responded by enacting §1346, which—despite the wide
array of intangible rights courts protected under the fraud
statutes pre-McNally—revived “only the
intangible right of honest services.” Cleveland, 531
U. S., at 19–20 (emphasis added). “Congress’
reverberating silence about other [such] intangible
interests” forecloses the expansion of the wire fraud statute
to cover the intangible right to control. United States v.
Sadler, 750 F.3d 585, 591 (CA6 2014).

															Finally, the right-to-control theory vastly
expands federal jurisdiction without statutory authorization.
Because the theory treats mere information as the protected
interest, almost any deceptive act could be criminal. See,
e.g., United States v. Viloski, 557 Fed. Appx.
28 (CA2 2014) (affirming right-to-control conviction based on an
employee’s undisclosed conflict of interest). The theory thus
makes a federal crime of an almost limitless variety of deceptive
actions traditionally left to state contract and tort law—in
flat contradiction with our caution that, “[a]bsent [a] clear
statement by Congress,” courts should “not read the
mail [and wire] fraud statute[s] to place under federal
superintendence a vast array of conduct traditionally policed by
the States.” Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 27. And, as
it did below, the Second Circuit has employed the theory to affirm
federal convictions regulating the ethics (or lack thereof )
of state employees and contractors—despite our admonition
that “[f]ederal prosecutors may not use property fraud
statutes to set standards of disclosure and good government for
state and local officials.” Kelly, 590 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 12) (alterations omitted). The right-to-control
theory thus criminalizes traditionally civil matters and
federalizes traditionally state matters.

															In sum, the wire fraud statute reaches only
traditional property interests. The right to valuable economic
information needed to make discretionary economic decisions is not
a traditional property interest. Accordingly, the right-to-control
theory cannot form the basis for a conviction under the federal
fraud statutes.

															B

															Despite indicting, obtaining convictions, and
prevailing on appeal based solely on the right-to-control theory,
the Government now concedes that the theory as articulated below is
erroneous. Brief for United States 24–26. The Government
frankly admits that, “to the extent that language in the
[Second Circuit’s] opinions might suggest that depriving a
victim of economically valuable information, without more,
necessarily qualifies as ‘obtaining money or property’
within the meaning of the fraud statutes, that is incorrect.”
Id., at 24. That should be the end of the case.

															Yet, the Government insists that its concession
does not require reversal because we can affirm Ciminelli’s
convictions on the alternative ground that the evidence was
sufficient to establish wire fraud under a traditional
property-fraud theory. Id., at 31–32. With profuse
citations to the records below, the Government asks us to
cherry-pick facts presented to a jury charged on the
right-to-control theory and apply them to the elements of a
different wire fraud theory in the first instance. In other
words, the Government asks us to assume not only the function of a
court of first view, but also of a jury. That is not our role. See,
e.g., McCormick v. United States, 500 U.S.
257, 270–271, n. 8 (1991) (“Appellate courts
are not permitted to affirm convictions on any theory they please
simply because the facts necessary to support the theory were
presented to the jury”); Chiarella v. United
States, 445 U.S.
222, 236 (1980). Accordingly, we decline the Government’s
request to affirm Ciminelli’s convictions on alternative
grounds.

															III

															The right-to-control theory is invalid under
the federal fraud statutes. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of
the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 An earlier indictment
alleged that the Buffalo Billion contracts were the property at
issue. But, to defend against the defendants’ motion to
dismiss, the Government relied solely on the theory that the scheme
“defraud[ed] Fort Schuyler of its right to control its
assets.” App. 31–32. The District Court then relied
expressly on the right-to-control theory in denying the motion to
dismiss. United States v. Percoco, 2017 WL 6314146,
*8 (SDNY, Dec. 11, 2017).
2
 Although Cleveland
involved the mail fraud statute, 18 U. S. C. §1341,
“we have construed identical language in the wire and mail
fraud statutes in pari materia.” Pasquantino v.
United States, 544 U.S.
349, 355, n. 2 (2005).
3
 At least two Circuits
have expressly repudiated the right-to-control theory of wire
fraud. United States v. Sadler, 750 F.3d 585,
590–592 (CA6 2014); United States v.
Bruchhausen, 977 F.2d 464, 467–469 (CA9 1992). Several
other Circuits have embraced the theory to varying degrees. See,
e.g., United States v. Gray, 
405 F.3d 227, 234 (CA4 2005) (collecting cases).
4
 The only judicial
authority the Second Circuit cited for this key proposition was a
1989 Fifth Circuit opinion that conclusorily asserted that
“[t]he economic value of . . . knowledge” was
“sufficient ‘property’ to implicate” the
mail fraud statute, and that appears to have misunderstood 18
U. S. C. §1346 as “eliminating the requirement
of property loss” in all cases. United States v.
Little, 889 F.2d 1367, 1368–1369. The Second Circuit
then proceeded to rely on the “bundle of sticks”
metaphor of property rights. See United States v.
Wallach, 935 F.2d 445, 463 (1991) (“[G]iven the
important role that information plays in the valuation of a
corporation, the right to complete and accurate information is one
of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that comprise
a stockholder’s property interest”). But that
metaphor—whatever its merits in other contexts—cannot
compensate for the absence of an interest that itself “has
long been recognized as property,” Carpenter v.
United States, 484 U.S.
19, 26 (1987), particularly in light of our rejection of
attempts to construe the federal fraud statutes “in a manner
that leaves [their] outer boundaries ambiguous.”
McNally v. United States, 483
U.S. 350, 360 (1987). As noted above, the right to information
necessary to make informed economic decisions, while perhaps useful
for protecting and making use of one’s property, has not
itself traditionally been recognized as a property
interest.
