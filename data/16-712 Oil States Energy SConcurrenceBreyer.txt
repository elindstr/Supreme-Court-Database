															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															OIL STATES ENERGY SERVICES, LLC, PETITIONER v. GREENE’S ENERGY GROUP, LLC, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[April 24, 2018]

															

															Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor join, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full.  The conclusion that inter partes review is a matter involving public rights is sufficient to show that it violates neither Article III nor the
 
Seventh Amendment.  But the Court’s opinion should not be read to say that matters involving private rights may never be adjudicated other than by Article III courts, say, sometimes by agencies.  Our precedent is to the contrary.  Stern v. Marshall,

564 U. S. 462, 494 (2011)
; Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor,

478 U. S. 833, 853
–856 (1986); see also Stern, supra, at 513 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (“The presence of ‘private rights’ does not automatically determine the outcome of the question but requires a more ‘searching’ examination of the relevant factors”).
