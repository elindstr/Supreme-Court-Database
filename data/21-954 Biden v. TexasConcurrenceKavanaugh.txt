															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–954

															_________________

															JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, et al., PETITIONERS v. TEXAS, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 30, 2022]

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															I agree with the Court that the District Court
had jurisdiction over Texas’s suit. I also agree with the
Court that the Government prevails on the merits of the two
specific legal questions presented here. I note, moreover, that six
Members of the Court agree with the Court’s merits
conclusion. See post, at 1 (Barrett, J., dissenting).

															I write separately to briefly elaborate on my
understanding of the relevant statutory provisions and to point out
one legal issue that remains open for resolution on remand.

															When the Department of Homeland Security lacks
sufficient capacity to detain noncitizens at the southern border
pending their immigration proceedings (often asylum proceedings),
the immigration laws afford DHS two primary options.

															Option one: DHS may grant noncitizens parole
into the United States if parole provides a “significant
public benefit.” 8 U. S. C. §1182(d)(5)(A).
Parole entails releasing individuals on a case-by-case basis into
the United States subject to “reasonable assurances”
that they “will appear at all hearings.” 8 CFR
§212.5(d) (2020); see 8 U. S. C.
§1182(d)(5)(A). Notably, every Administration beginning in the
late 1990s has relied heavily on the parole option, including the
administrations of Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, and
Biden. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 49–54.

															Option two: DHS may choose to return noncitizens
to Mexico. 8 U. S. C. §1225(b)(2)(C). Consistent
with that statutory authority, the prior Administration chose to
return a relatively small group of noncitizens to Mexico.

															In general, when there is insufficient detention
capacity, both the parole option and the return-to-Mexico option
are legally permissible options under the immigration statutes. As
the recent history illustrates, every President since the late
1990s has employed the parole option, and President Trump also
employed the return-to-Mexico option for a relatively small group
of noncitizens. Because the immigration statutes afford substantial
discretion to the Executive, different Presidents may exercise that
discretion differently. That is Administrative Law 101. See
Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State
Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S.
29, 59 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part).

															To be sure, the Administrative Procedure Act and
this Court’s decision in State Farm require that an
executive agency’s exercise of discretion be reasonable and
reasonably explained. See id., at 43 (majority opinion); see
also FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U. S.
___, ___−___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 7−8, 11);
FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S.
502, 514−515 (2009); 5 U. S. C. §706. For
example, when there is insufficient detention capacity and DHS
chooses to parole noncitizens into the United States rather than
returning them to Mexico, DHS must reasonably explain why parole
provides a “significant public benefit.” 8
U. S. C. §1182(d)(5)(A); see, e.g., State
Farm, 463 U. S., at 46–57. Review under that
State Farm standard is deferential but not toothless.
Id., at 56.

															The question of whether DHS’s October 29
decision satisfies the State Farm standard is not before
this Court at this time. The Court today therefore properly leaves
the State Farm issue for consideration on remand. See
ante, at 18, 25; Tr. of Oral Arg. 67−68.

															To be clear, when there is insufficient
detention capacity and the President chooses the parole option
because he determines that returning noncitizens to Mexico is not
feasible for foreign-policy reasons, a court applying State
Farm must be deferential to the President’s Article II
foreign-policy judgment. Cf., e.g., Trump v.
Hawaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (slip op.,
at 10–15). Nothing in the relevant immigration statutes at
issue here suggests that Congress wanted the Federal Judiciary to
improperly second-guess the President’s Article II judgment
with respect to American foreign policy and foreign relations. See
Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S.
579, 635−637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring); see also
Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453
U.S. 654, 678–679, 686–688 (1981).

															One final note: The larger policy story behind
this case is the multi-decade inability of the political branches
to provide DHS with sufficient facilities to detain noncitizens who
seek to enter the United States pending their immigration
proceedings. But this Court has authority to address only the legal
issues before us. We do not have authority to end the legislative
stalemate or to resolve the underlying policy problems.

															With those additional comments, I join the
Court’s opinion in full.
