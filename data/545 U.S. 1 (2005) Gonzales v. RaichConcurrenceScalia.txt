SCALIA, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT
GONZALES V. RAICH
545 U. S. ____ (2005)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-1454

															ALBERTO R. GONZALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. ANGEL McCLARY RAICH et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 6, 2005]

															   Justice Scalia, concurring in the
judgment.

															   I agree with the Court’s
holding that the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) may validly be
applied to respondents’ cultivation, distribution, and
possession of marijuana for personal, medicinal use. I write
separately because my understanding of the doctrinal foundation on
which that holding rests is, if not inconsistent with that of the
Court, at least more nuanced.

															   Since Perez v. United
States, 402 U.
S. 146 (1971), our cases have mechanically recited that the
Commerce Clause permits congressional regulation of three
categories: (1) the channels of interstate commerce; (2) the
instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and persons or things in
interstate commerce; and (3) activities that “substantially
affect” interstate commerce. Id., at 150; see
United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598,
608–609 (2000); United States v. Lopez,
514 U. S. 549, 558–559 (1995);
Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation
Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264,
276–277 (1981). The first two categories are self-evident,
since they are the ingredients of interstate commerce itself. See
Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189–190
(1824). The third category, however, is different in kind, and its
recitation without explanation is misleading and incomplete.

															   It is misleading because, unlike the
channels, instrumentalities, and agents of interstate commerce,
activities that substantially affect interstate commerce are not
themselves part of interstate commerce, and thus the power to
regulate them cannot come from the Commerce Clause alone. Rather,
as this Court has acknowledged since at least United
States v. Coombs, 12 Pet. 72 (1838), Congress’s
regulatory authority over intrastate activities that are not
themselves part of interstate commerce (including activities that
have a substantial effect on interstate commerce) derives from the
Necessary and Proper Clause. Id., at 78;
Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294,
301–302 (1964); United States v. Wrightwood
Dairy Co., 315
U. S. 110, 119 (1942); Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342, 353
(1914); United States v. E. C. Knight Co.,
156 U. S. 1,
39–40 (1895) (Harlan, J., dissenting).[Footnote 1] And the category of “activities
that substantially affect interstate commerce,”
Lopez, supra, at 559, is incomplete
because the authority to enact laws necessary and proper for the
regulation of interstate commerce is not limited to laws governing
intrastate activities that substantially affect interstate
commerce. Where necessary to make a regulation of interstate
commerce effective, Congress may regulate even those intrastate
activities that do not themselves substantially affect interstate
commerce.

															I

															   Our cases show that the
regulation of intrastate activities may be necessary to and proper
for the regulation of interstate commerce in two general
circumstances. Most directly, the commerce power permits Congress
not only to devise rules for the governance of commerce between
States but also to facilitate interstate commerce by eliminating
potential obstructions, and to restrict it by eliminating potential
stimulants. See NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel
Corp., 301 U. S.
1, 36–37 (1937). That is why the Court has repeatedly
sustained congressional legislation on the ground that the
regulated activities had a substantial effect on interstate
commerce. See, e.g., Hodel, supra, at
281 (surface coal mining); Katzenbach, supra, at
300 (discrimination by restaurants); Heart of Atlanta Motel,
Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 258
(1964) (discrimination by hotels); Mandeville Island Farms
v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U. S. 219, 237
(1948) (intrastate price-fixing); Board of Trade of
Chicago v. Olsen, 262 U. S. 1, 40 (1923)
(activities of a local grain exchange); Stafford v.
Wallace, 258 U. S. 495, 517,
524–525 (1922) (intrastate transactions at stockyard).
Lopez and Morrison recognized the expansive scope
of Congress’s authority in this regard: “[T]he pattern
is clear. Where economic activity substantially affects interstate
commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be
sustained.” Lopez, supra, at 560;
Morrison, supra, at 610 (same).

															   This principle is not without
limitation. In Lopez and Morrison, the
Court—conscious of the potential of the “substantially
affects” test to “ ‘obliterate the
distinction between what is national and what is
local,’ ” Lopez, supra, at
566–567 (quoting A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v.
United States, 295 U. S. 495, 554
(1935)); see also Morrison, supra, at
615–616—rejected the argument that Congress may
regulate noneconomic activity based solely on the effect
that it may have on interstate commerce through a remote chain of
inferences. Lopez, supra, at 564–566;
Morrison, supra, at 617–618. “[I]f we
were to accept [such] arguments,” the Court reasoned in
Lopez, “we are hard pressed to posit any activity by
an individual that Congress is without power to regulate.”
Lopez, supra, at 564; see also Morrison,
supra, at 615–616. Thus, although Congress’s
authority to regulate intrastate activity that substantially
affects interstate commerce is broad, it does not permit the Court
to “pile inference upon inference,” Lopez,
supra, at 567, in order to establish that noneconomic
activity has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

															   As we implicitly acknowledged in
Lopez, however, Congress’s authority to enact laws
necessary and proper for the regulation of interstate commerce is
not limited to laws directed against economic activities that have
a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Though the conduct in
Lopez was not economic, the Court nevertheless recognized
that it could be regulated as “an essential part of a larger
regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme
could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were
regulated.” 514 U. S., at 561. This statement referred to
those cases permitting the regulation of intrastate activities
“which in a substantial way interfere with or obstruct the
exercise of the granted power.” Wrightwood Dairy
Co., 315 U. S., at 119; see also United States v.
Darby, 312
U. S. 100, 118–119 (1941); Shreveport Rate
Cases, 234 U. S., at 353. As the Court put it in
Wrightwood Dairy, where Congress has the authority to
enact a regulation of interstate commerce, “it possesses
every power needed to make that regulation effective.” 315 U.
S., at 118–119.

															   Although this power “to make …
regulation effective” commonly overlaps with the authority to
regulate economic activities that substantially affect interstate
commerce,[Footnote 2] and may
in some cases have been confused with that authority, the two are
distinct. The regulation of an intrastate activity may be essential
to a comprehensive regulation of interstate commerce even though
the intrastate activity does not itself “substantially
affect” interstate commerce. Moreover, as the passage from
Lopez quoted above suggests, Congress may regulate even
noneconomic local activity if that regulation is a necessary part
of a more general regulation of interstate commerce. See
Lopez, supra, at 561. The relevant question is
simply whether the means chosen are “reasonably
adapted” to the attainment of a legitimate end under the
commerce power. See Darby, supra, at 121.

															   In Darby, for instance, the Court
explained that “Congress, having … adopted the policy
of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the
commerce which do not conform to the specified labor
standards,” 312 U. S., at 121, could not only require
employers engaged in the production of goods for interstate
commerce to conform to wage and hour standards, id., at
119–121, but could also require those employers to keep
employment records in order to demonstrate compliance with the
regulatory scheme, id., at 125. While the Court sustained
the former regulation on the alternative ground that the activity
it regulated could have a “great effect” on interstate
commerce, id., at 122–123, it affirmed the latter on
the sole ground that “[t]he requirement for records even of
the intrastate transaction is an appropriate means to a legitimate
end,” id., at 125.

															   As the Court said in the Shreveport Rate
Cases, the Necessary and Proper Clause does not give
“Congress … the authority to regulate the internal
commerce of a State, as such,” but it does allow Congress
“to take all measures necessary or appropriate to” the
effective regulation of the interstate market, “although
intrastate transactions … may thereby be controlled.”
234 U. S., at 353; see also Jones & Laughlin Steel
Corp., 301 U. S., at 38 (the logic of the Shreveport
Rate Cases is not limited to instrumentalities of
commerce).

															II

															   Today’s principal dissent
objects that, by permitting Congress to regulate activities
necessary to effective interstate regulation, the Court reduces
Lopez and Morrison to “little more than a
drafting guide.” Post, at 5 (opinion of
O’Connor, J.). I think that criticism unjustified. Unlike the
power to regulate activities that have a substantial effect on
interstate commerce, the power to enact laws enabling effective
regulation of interstate commerce can only be exercised in
conjunction with congressional regulation of an interstate market,
and it extends only to those measures necessary to make the
interstate regulation effective. As Lopez itself states,
and the Court affirms today, Congress may regulate noneconomic
intrastate activities only where the failure to do so “could
… undercut” its regulation of interstate commerce. See
Lopez, supra, at 561; ante, at 15, 21,
22. This is not a power that threatens to obliterate the line
between “what is truly national and what is truly
local.” Lopez, supra, at 567–568.

															   Lopez and
Morrison affirm that Congress may not regulate certain
“purely local” activity within the States based solely
on the attenuated effect that such activity may have in the
interstate market. But those decisions do not declare noneconomic
intrastate activities to be categorically beyond the reach of the
Federal Government. Neither case involved the power of Congress to
exert control over intrastate activities in connection with a more
comprehensive scheme of regulation; Lopez expressly
disclaimed that it was such a case, 514 U. S., at 561, and
Morrison did not even discuss the possibility that it was.
(The Court of Appeals in Morrison made clear that it was
not. See Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Inst.,
169 F. 3d 820, 834–835 (CA4 1999) (en banc).) To dismiss
this distinction as “superficial and formalistic,” see
post, at 6 (O’Connor, J., dissenting), is to
misunderstand the nature of the Necessary and Proper Clause, which
empowers Congress to enact laws in effectuation of its enumerated
powers that are not within its authority to enact in isolation. See
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316,
421–422 (1819).

															   And there are other restraints upon the
Necessary and Proper Clause authority. As Chief Justice Marshall
wrote in McCulloch v. Maryland, even when the end
is constitutional and legitimate, the means must be
“appropriate” and “plainly adapted” to that
end. Id., at 421. Moreover, they may not be otherwise
“prohibited” and must be “consistent with the
letter and spirit of the constitution.” Ibid. These
phrases are not merely hortatory. For example, cases such as
Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898 (1997),
and New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992),
affirm that a law is not “ ‘proper for
carrying into Execution the Commerce Clause’ ”
“[w]hen [it] violates [a constitutional] principle of state
sovereignty.” Printz, supra, at
923–924; see also New York, supra, at
166.

															III

															   The application of these
principles to the case before us is straightforward. In the CSA,
Congress has undertaken to extinguish the interstate market in
Schedule I controlled substances, including marijuana. The Commerce
Clause unquestionably permits this. The power to regulate
interstate commerce “extends not only to those regulations
which aid, foster and protect the commerce, but embraces those
which prohibit it.” Darby, 312 U. S., at 113. See
also Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, 220 U. S. 45, 58 (1911);
Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 354
(1903). To effectuate its objective, Congress has prohibited almost
all intrastate activities related to Schedule I
substances—both economic activities (manufacture,
distribution, possession with the intent to distribute) and
noneconomic activities (simple possession). See 21 U. S. C.
§§841(a), 844(a). That simple possession is a noneconomic
activity is immaterial to whether it can be prohibited as a
necessary part of a larger regulation. Rather, Congress’s
authority to enact all of these prohibitions of intrastate
controlled-substance activities depends only upon whether they are
appropriate means of achieving the legitimate end of eradicating
Schedule I substances from interstate commerce.

															   By this measure, I think the
regulation must be sustained. Not only is it impossible to
distinguish “controlled substances manufactured and
distributed intrastate” from “controlled substances
manufactured and distributed interstate,” but it hardly makes
sense to speak in such terms. Drugs like marijuana are fungible
commodities. As the Court explains, marijuana that is grown at home
and possessed for personal use is never more than an instant from
the interstate market—and this is so whether or not the
possession is for medicinal use or lawful use under the laws of a
particular State.[Footnote 3]
See ante, at 23–30. Congress need not accept on
faith that state law will be effective in maintaining a strict
division between a lawful market for “medical”
marijuana and the more general marijuana market. See id.,
at 26–27, and n. 38. “To impose on [Congress] the
necessity of resorting to means which it cannot control, which
another government may furnish or withhold, would render its course
precarious, the result of its measures uncertain, and create a
dependence on other governments, which might disappoint its most
important designs, and is incompatible with the language of the
constitution.” McCulloch, supra, at
424.

															   Finally, neither respondents nor the
dissenters suggest any violation of state sovereignty of the sort
that would render this regulation “inappropriate,”
id., at 421—except to argue that the CSA regulates
an area typically left to state regulation. See post, at
6–7, 11 (opinion of O’Connor, J.); post, at
8–9 (opinion of Thomas, J.); Brief for Respondents
39–42. That is not enough to render federal regulation an
inappropriate means. The Court has repeatedly recognized that, if
authorized by the commerce power, Congress may regulate private
endeavors “even when [that regulation] may pre-empt express
state-law determinations contrary to the result which has commended
itself to the collective wisdom of Congress.” National
League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833, 840
(1976); see Cleveland v. United States, 329 U. S. 14, 19 (1946);
McCulloch, supra, at 424. At bottom, respondents’
state-sovereignty argument reduces to the contention that federal
regulation of the activities permitted by California’s
Compassionate Use Act is not sufficiently necessary to be
“necessary and proper” to Congress’s regulation
of the interstate market. For the reasons given above and in the
Court’s opinion, I cannot agree.

															***

															   I thus agree with the Court that,
however the class of regulated activities is subdivided, Congress
could reasonably conclude that its objective of prohibiting
marijuana from the interstate market “could be
undercut” if those activities were excepted from its general
scheme of regulation. See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 561. That
is sufficient to authorize the application of the CSA to
respondents.
Footnote 1

															 See also Garcia v. San Antonio
Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528,
584–585 (1985) (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (explaining
that it is through the Necessary and Proper Clause that “an
intrastate activity ‘affecting’ interstate commerce can
be reached through the commerce power”).
Footnote 2

															 Wickard v. Filburn,
317 U. S. 111
(1942), presented such a case. Because the unregulated production
of wheat for personal consumption diminished demand in the
regulated wheat market, the Court said, it carried with it the
potential to disrupt Congress’s price regulation by driving
down prices in the market. Id., at 127–129. This
potential disruption of Congress’s interstate regulation, and
not only the effect that personal consumption of wheat had on
interstate commerce, justified Congress’s regulation of that
conduct. Id., at 128–129.
Footnote 3

															 The principal dissent claims that, if this is
sufficient to sustain the regulation at issue in this case, then it
should also have been sufficient to sustain the regulation at issue
in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995). See
post, at 11–12 (arguing that “we could have
surmised in Lopez that guns in school zones are
‘never more than an instant from the interstate market’
in guns already subject to federal regulation, recast
Lopez as a Necessary and Proper Clause case, and thereby
upheld the Gun-Free School Zones Act”). This claim founders
upon the shoals of Lopez itself, which made clear that the
statute there at issue was “not an essential part of
a larger regulation of economic activity.” Lopez,
supra, at 561 (emphasis added). On the dissent’s
view of things, that statement is inexplicable. Of course it is in
addition difficult to imagine what intelligible scheme of
regulation of the interstate market in guns could have as an
appropriate means of effectuation the prohibition of guns within
1000 feet of schools (and nowhere else). The dissent points to a
federal law, 18 U. S. C. §922(b)(1), barring licensed
dealers from selling guns to minors, see post, at 12, but
the relationship between the regulatory scheme of which
§922(b)(1) is a part (requiring all dealers in firearms that
have traveled in interstate commerce to be licensed, see
§922(a)) and the statute at issue in Lopez approaches
the nonexistent—which is doubtless why the Government did not
attempt to justify the statute on the basis of that
relationship.
