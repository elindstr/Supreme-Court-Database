Railroad Commission of Texas v. Humble Oil & Refining Co.
No. 57
Argued December 12, 1940
Decided January 6, 1941
311 U.S. 578

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
Syllabus 

															Decided upon the authority of Railroad Commission of Texas v. Rowan & Nichols Oil Co., ante, p.  311 U. S. 570.

															Decree vacated.

															MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.

															This case is a companion case to Railroad Commission v. Rowan & Nichols Oil Co., ante, p.  311 U. S. 570.  There are minor variations in the facts of the two cases, but not of sufficient moment to call for particularization.  The decision in the Rowan & Nichols case is decisive of this.

															The decree is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for dismissal of the complaint.

															Vacated.

															THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS and MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS dissent.
