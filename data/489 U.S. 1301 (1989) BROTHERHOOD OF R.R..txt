SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. No. A-715.  Supreme Court of the United States  March 14, 1989  On application to vacate injunction.  Justice BRENNAN, Circuit Justice.  Applicants request me, as Circuit Justice, to enter an order " immediately dissolving" the injunction issued by the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. I deny the application. In my view, applicants have not "established that there is a 'reasonable probability' that four Justices will consider the issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari." Rostker v.
