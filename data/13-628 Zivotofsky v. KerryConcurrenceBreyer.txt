															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															MENACHEM BINYAMIN ZIVOTOFSKY, by his parents
and guardians, ARI Z. AND NAOMI SIEGMAN ZIVOTOFSKY, PETITIONER
v. JOHN KERRY, SECRETARY OF STATE

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

															[June 8, 2015]

															

															Justice Breyer, concurring.

															I continue to believe that this case presents a
political question inappropriate for judicial resolution. See
Zivo-tofsky v. Clinton, 566 U. S. ___, ___ (2012)
(Breyer, J., dissenting). But because precedent precludes resolving
this case on political question grounds, see id., at ___
(majority opinion) (slip op., at 1), I join the Court’s
opinion.
