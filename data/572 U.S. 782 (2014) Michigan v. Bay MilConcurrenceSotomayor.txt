															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															MICHIGAN, PETITIONER v. BAY MILLS
INDIANCOMMUNITY et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[May 27, 2014]

															

															     Justice Sotomayor,
concurring.

															     The doctrine of tribal
immunity has been a part of American jurisprudence for well over a
century. See, e.g., Parks v. Ross, 11 How. 362 (1851); Struve,
Tribal Immu-nity and Tribal Courts, 36 Ariz. St. L. J. 137,
148–155 (2004) (tracing the origins of the doctrine to the
mid-19th cen-tury); Wood, It Wasn’t An Accident: The Tribal
Sovereign Immunity Story, 62 Am. U. L. Rev. 1587, 1640–1641
(2013) (same). And in more recent decades, this Court has
consistently affirmed the doctrine. See, e.g., United States v.
United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 309 U. S. 506
(1940) ; Puyallup Tribe, Inc. v. Department of Game of Wash., 433
U. S. 165 (1977) ; C & L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band
Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Okla., 532 U. S. 411, 418 (2001) .
Despite this history, the principal dissent chides the Court for
failing to offer a sufficient basis for the doctrine of tribal
immunity, post, at 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.), and reasons that we
should at least limit the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity in
ways that resemble restrictions on foreign sovereign immunity.

															     The majority
compellingly explains why stare decisis and deference to
Congress’ careful regulatory scheme require affirming the
decision below. I write separately to further detail why both
history and comity counsel against limiting Tribes’ sovereign
immunity in the manner the principal dissent advances.

															I

															     Long before the
formation of the United States, Tribes “were self-governing
sovereign political communities.” United States v. Wheeler,
435 U. S. 313 –323 (1978). And Tribes “have not
given up their full sovereignty.” Id., at 323. Absent
contrary congressional acts, Tribes “retain their existing
sovereign powers” and “possess those aspects of
sovereignty not withdrawn by treaty or statute, or by implication
as a necessary result of their dependent status.” Ibid. See
also 25 U. S. C. §1301(1) (affirming Tribes’
continued “powers of self-government”). In this case
then, the question is what type of immunity federal courts should
accord to Tribes, commensurate with their retained sovereignty.

															     In answering this
question, the principal dissent analogizes tribal sovereign
immunity to foreign sovereign immunity. Foreign sovereigns (unlike
States) are generally not immune from suits arising from their
commercial activities. Post, at 4; see also Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. §1605(a)(2)
(commercial-activity exception to foreign sovereign immunity). This
analogy, however, lacks force. Indian Tribes have never
historically been classified as “foreign” governments
in federal courts even when they asked to be.

															     The case of Cherokee
Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1 (1831), is instructive. In 1828 and
1829, the Georgia Legislature enacted a series of laws that
purported to nullify acts of the Cherokee government and seize
Cherokee land, among other things. Id., at 7–8. The Cherokee
Nation sued Georgia in this Court, alleging that Georgia’s
laws violated federal law and treaties. Id., at 7. As the
constitutional basis for jurisdiction, the Tribe relied on Article
III, §2, cl. 1, which extends the federal judicial power to
cases “between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign
states, citizens, or subjects.” 5 Pet., at 15 (internal
quotation marks omitted). But this Court concluded that it lacked
jurisdiction because Tribes were not “foreign
state[s].” Id., at 20. The Court reasoned that “[t]he
condition of the Indians in relation to the United States is
perhaps unlike that of any other two people in existence.”
Id., at 16. Tribes were more akin to “domestic dependent
nations,” the Court explained, than to foreign nations. Id.,
at 17. We have repeatedly relied on that characterization in
subsequent cases. See, e.g., Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Citizen
Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U. S. 505, 509 (1991) ;
Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130, 141 (1982) .
Two centuries of jurisprudence therefore weigh against treating
Tribes like foreign visitors in American courts.

															II

															     The principal dissent
contends that whenever one sovereign is sued in the courts of
another, the question whether to confer sovereign immunity is not a
matter of right but rather one of “comity.” Post, at 3.
But in my view, the premise leads to a different conclusion than
the one offered by the dissent. Principles of comity strongly
counsel in favor of continued recognition of tribal sovereign
immunity, including for off-reservation commercial conduct.

															    
Comity—“that is, ‘a proper respect for [a
sovereign’s] functions,’ ” Sprint
Communications, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U. S. ___, ___ (2013)
(slip op., at 7)—fosters “respectful, harmonious
relations” between governments, Wood v. Milyard, 566
U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7). For two reasons, these
goals are best served by recognizing sovereign immunity for Indian
Tribes, including immunity for off-reservation conduct, except
where Congress has expressly abrogated it. First, a legal rule that
permitted States to sue Tribes, absent their consent, for
commercial conduct would be anomalous in light of the existing
prohibitions against Tribes’ suing States in like
circumstances. Such disparate treatment of these two classes of
domestic sovereigns would hardly signal the Federal
Government’s respect for tribal sovereignty. Second, Tribes
face a number of barriers to raising revenue in traditional ways.
If Tribes are ever to become more self-sufficient, and fund a more
substantial portion of their own governmental functions, commercial
enterprises will likely be a central means of achieving that
goal.

															A

															     We have held that
Tribes may not sue States in federal court, Blatchford v. Native
Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775 (1991) , including for
commercial conduct that chiefly impacts Indian reservations,
Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996) . In
Seminole Tribe, the Tribe sued the State of Florida in federal
court under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA)—the same
statute petitioner relies on here. The suit alleged that Florida
had breached its statutory “duty to negotiate in good faith
with [the Tribe] toward the formation of a [gaming] compact.”
Id., at 47. This Court held that state sovereign immunity
prohibited such a suit.

															     Importantly, the Court
barred the Tribe’s suit against Florida even though the case
involved the State’s conduct in the course of commercial
negotiations. As this Court later observed, relying in part on
Seminole Tribe, the doctrine of state sovereign immunity is not
“any less robust” when the case involves conduct
“that is undertaken for profit, that is traditionally
performed by private citizens and corporations, and that otherwise
resembles the behavior of ‘market
participants.’ ” College Savings Bank v. Florida
Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U. S. 666, 684
(1999) . Nor did Seminole Tribe adopt a state corollary to the
“off-reservation” exception to tribal sovereign
immunity that the principal dissent urges today. To the contrary,
the negotiations in Seminole Tribe concerned gaming on Indian
lands, not state lands.

															     As the principal
dissent observes, “comity is about one sovereign respecting
the dignity of another.” Post, at 4. This Court would hardly
foster respect for the dignity of Tribes by allowing States to sue
Tribes for commercial activity on State lands, while prohibiting
Tribes from suing States for commercial activity on Indian lands.
Both States and Tribes are domestic governments who come to this
Court with sovereignty that they have not entirely ceded to the
Federal Government.

															     Similar asymmetry would
result if States could sue Tribes in state courts.[1] In Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U. S. 353,
355 (2001) , this Court considered whether a tribal court had
“jurisdiction over civil claims against state officials who
entered tribal land to execute a search warrant against a tribe
member suspected of having violated state law outside the
reservation.” It held that the tribal court did not. Id., at
374. In reaching that conclusion, the Court observed that
“[s]tate sovereignty does not end at a reservation’s
border.” Id., at 361. And relying on similar principles, some
federal courts have more explicitly held that tribal courts may not
entertain suits against States. See, e.g., Montana v. Gilham, 133
F. 3d 1133, 1136–1137 (CA9 1998) (holding that while
neither “the Eleventh Amendment [n]or congressional
act” barred suits against States in tribal courts, “the
inherent sovereign powers of the States” barred such suits).
To the extent Tribes are barred from suing in tribal courts, it
would be anomalous to permit suits against Tribes in state
courts.

															     Two of the dissenting
opinions implicitly address this asymmetry. The principal dissent
reasons that States and Tribes should be treated differently for
purposes of sovereign immunity because—unlike tribal
sovereign immu-nity—state sovereign immunity has
constitutional origins. Post, at 3, n. 1. Justice Ginsburg
offers another view: that Tribes and States should both receive
less immunity. She expresses concerns about cases like Seminole
Tribe, pointing to dissents that have catalogued the many problems
associated with the Court’s sprawling state sovereign
immunity jurisprudence. Post, at 1–2 (citing, among others,
Alden v. Maine, 527 U. S. 706, 814 (1999) (Souter, J.,
dissenting)).

															     As things stand,
however, Seminole Tribe and its prog-eny remain the law. And so
long as that is so, comity would be ill-served by unequal treatment
of States and Tribes. If Tribes cannot sue States for commercial
activities on tribal lands, the converse should also be true. Any
other result would fail to respect the dignity of Indian
Tribes.

															B

															     The principal dissent
contends that Tribes have emerged as particularly
“substantial and successful” commercial actors. Post,
at 13. The dissent expresses concern that, although tribal leaders
can be sued for prospective relief, ante, at 13 (majority opinion),
Tribes’ purportedly growing coffers remain unexposed to broad
damages liability. Post, at 10–11. These observations suffer
from two flaws.

															     First, not all Tribes
are engaged in highly lucrative commercial activity. Nearly half of
federally recognized Tribes in the United States do not operate
gaming facilities at all. A. Meister, Casino City’s Indian
Gaming Industry Report 28 (2009–2010 ed.) (noting that
“only 237, or 42 percent, of the 564 federally recognized
Native American tribes in the U. S. operate
gaming”).[2] And even
among the Tribes that do, gaming revenue is far from uniform. As of
2009, fewer than 20% of Indian gaming facilities accounted for
roughly 70% of the revenues from such facilities. Ibid. One must
therefore temper any impression that Tribes across the country have
suddenly and uniformly found their treasuries filled with gaming
revenue.

															     Second, even if all
Tribes were equally successful in generating commercial revenues,
that would not justify the commercial-activity exception urged by
the principal dissent. For tribal gaming operations cannot be
understood as mere profit-making ventures that are wholly separate
from the Tribes’ core governmental functions. A key goal of
the Federal Government is to render Tribes more self-sufficient,
and better positioned to fund their own sovereign functions, rather
than relying on federal funding. 25 U. S. C.
§2702(1) (explaining that Congress’ purpose in enacting
IGRA was “to provide a statutory basis for the operation of
gaming by Indian tribes as a means of promoting tribal economic
development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal
governments”); see also Cohen’s Handbook of Federal
Indian Law 1357–1373 (2012) (Cohen’s Handbook)
(describing various types of federal financial assistance that
Tribes receive). And tribal business operations are critical to the
goals of tribal self-sufficiency because such enterprises in some
cases “may be the only means by which a tribe can raise
revenues,” Struve, 36 Ariz. St. L. J., at 169. This is due in
large part to the insuperable (and often state-imposed) barriers
Tribes face in raising revenue through more traditional means.

															     For example, States
have the power to tax certain individuals and companies based on
Indian reservations, making it difficult for Tribes to raise
revenue from those sources. See Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.
Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U. S. 505
(allowing State to collect taxes on sales to non-Indians on Indian
land); Arizona Dept. of Revenue v. Blaze Constr. Co., 526
U. S. 32 (1999) (allowing taxation of companies owned by
non-Indians on Indian land); Thomas v. Gay, 169 U. S. 264 (1898)
(allowing taxation of property owned by non-Indians on Indian
land). States may also tax reservation land that Congress has
authorized individuals to hold in fee, regardless of whether it is
held by Indians or non-Indians. See Cass County v. Leech Lake Band
of Chip-pewa Indians, 524 U. S. 103 (1998) (States may tax
Indian reservation land if Congress made the land subject to sale
under the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887 (also known as the
Dawes Act)); County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of
Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251 (1992) (same).

															     As commentators have
observed, if Tribes were to impose their own taxes on these same
sources, the resulting double taxation would discourage economic
growth. Fletcher, In Pursuit of Tribal Economic Development as a
Substitute for Reservation Tax Revenue, 80 N. D. L. Rev.
759, 771 (2004); see also Cowan, Double Taxation in Indian Country:
Unpacking the Problem and Analyzing the Role of the Federal
Government in Protecting Tribal Governmental Revenues, 2 Pittsburgh
Tax Rev. 93, 95 (2005); Enterprise Zones, Hearings before the
Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures of the House Committee On
Ways and Means, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 234 (1991) (statement of
Peterson Zah, President of the Navajo Nation) (“[D]ouble
taxation interferes with our ability to encourage economic activity
and to develop effective reve-nue generating tax programs. Many
businesses may find it easier to avoid doing business on our
reservations rather than . . . bear the brunt of an added
tax burden”).

															     If non-Indians
controlled only a small amount of prop-erty on Indian reservations,
and if only a negligible amount of land was held in fee, the
double-taxation concern might be less severe. But for many Tribes,
that is not the case. History explains why this is so: Federal
policies enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries rendered
a devastating blow to tribal ownership. In 1887, Congress enacted
the Dawes Act. 24Stat. 388. That Act had two major components
relevant here. First, it converted the property that belonged to
Indian Tribes into fee property, and allotted the land to
individual Indians. Id., at 388–389. Much of this land passed
quickly to non-Indian owners. Royster, The Legacy of Allotment, 27
Ariz. St. L. J. 1, 12 (1995). Indeed, by 1934, the amount of land
that passed from Indian Tribes to non-Indians totaled 90 million
acres. See Cohen’s Handbook 74. Other property passed to
non-Indians when destitute Indians found themselves unable to pay
state taxes, resulting in sheriff’s sales. Royster, supra, at
12.

															     A second component of
the Dawes Act opened “surplus” land on Indian
reservations to settlement by non-Indians. 24Stat. 389–390.
Selling surplus lands to non-Indians was part of a more general
policy of forced assimilation. See Cohen’s Handbook 75. Sixty
million acres of land passed to non-Indian hands as a result of
surplus programs. Royster, supra, at 13.[3]

															     These policies have
left a devastating legacy, as the cases that have come before this
Court demonstrate. We noted in Montana v. United States, 450
U. S. 544, 548 (1981) , for example, that due in large part to
the Dawes Act, 28% of the Crow Tribe’s reservation in Montana
was held in fee by non-Indians. Similarly, Justice White observed
in Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492
U. S. 408, 414 (1989) (plurality opinion), that 20% of the Yakima
Nation’s reservation was owned in fee. For reservations like
those, it is particu-larly impactful that States and local
governments may tax property held by non-Indians, Thomas, 169 U.
S., at 264–265, and land held in fee as a result of the Dawes
Act. See County of Yakima, 502 U. S., at 259.

															     Moreover, Tribes are
largely unable to obtain substantial revenue by taxing tribal
members who reside on non-fee land that was not allotted under the
Dawes Act. As one scholar recently observed, even if Tribes imposed
high taxes on Indian residents, “there is very little income,
property, or sales they could tax.” Fletcher, supra, at 774.
The poverty and unemployment rates on Indian reservations are
significantly greater than the national average. See n. 4,
infra. As a result, “there is no stable tax base on most
reservations.” Fletcher, supra, at 774; see Williams, Small
Steps on the Long Road to Self-Sufficiency for In-dian Nations: The
Indian Tribal Governmental Tax Status Act of 1982, 22 Harv. J.
Legis. 335, 385 (1985).

															     To be sure, poverty has
decreased over the past few decades on reservations that have
gaming activity. One recent study found that between 1990 and 2000,
the presence of a tribal casino increased average per capita income
by 7.4% and reduced the family poverty rate by 4.9 percentage
points. Anderson, Tribal Casino Impacts on Amer-ican Indians
Well-Being: Evidence From Reservation-Level Census Data, 31
Contemporary Economic Policy 291, 298 (Apr. 2013). But even
reservations that have gaming continue to experience significant
poverty, especially relative to the national average. See id., at
296. The same is true of Indian reservations more
generally.[4]

															*  *  *

															     Both history and
proper respect for tribal sovereignty—or comity—counsel
against creating a special “commercial activity”
exception to tribal sovereign immunity. For these reasons, and for
the important reasons of stare decisis and deference to Congress
outlined in the majority opinion, I concur.
