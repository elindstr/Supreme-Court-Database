															TRAVIS BECKLES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

															[March 6, 2017]

															

															Justice Kennedy, concurring.

															As sentencing laws and standards continue to evolve, cases may arise in which the formulation of a sentencing provision leads to a sentence, or a pattern of sentencing, challenged as so arbitrary that it implicates constitutional concerns.  In that instance, a litigant might use the word vague in a general sense—that is to say, imprecise or unclear—in trying to establish that the sentencing decision was flawed.  That something is vague as a general matter, however, does not necessarily mean that it is vague within the well-established legal meaning of that term.  And it seems most unlikely that the definitional structure used to explain vagueness in the context of fair warning to a transgressor, or of preventing arbitrary enforcement, is, by automatic transference, applicable to the subject of sentencing where judicial discretion is involved as distinct from a statutory command.  See Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S. ___ (2015).

															The existing principles for defining vagueness cannot be transported uncritically to the realm of judicial discretion in sentencing.  Some other explication of the constitutional limitations likely would be required.

															These considerations inform my reading of the Court’s opinion, in which I join.
