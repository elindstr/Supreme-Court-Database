															Unicolors, Inc., PETITIONER v. H&M Hennes & Mauritz, L. P.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[February 24, 2022]

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins, and with whom Justice Gorsuch joins as to all but Part II, dissenting.

															A copyright registration is invalid if the registrant included materially inaccurate information in its application “with knowledge that [the information] was inaccurate.”

17 U. S. C. §411(b)(1)(A).  In its petition for certiorari, Unicolors asked us to decide a question on which the Courts of Appeals were split: whether §411(b)(1)(A)’s “knowledge” element requires “indicia of fraud.”  Pet. for Cert. i.  Specifically, Unicolors argued that “knowledge” requires “inten[t] to defraud the Copyright Office.”  Id., at 7.

															Yet now, after having “persuaded us to grant certiorari on this issue,” Unicolors has “chosen to rely on a different argument in [its] merits briefing.”  Visa Inc. v. Osborn, 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (internal punctuation altered).  It no longer argues that §411(b)(1)(A) requires fraudulent intent and instead proposes a novel “actual knowledge” standard.  Because I would not reward Unicolors for its legerdemain, and because no other court had, before today, ever addressed whether §411(b)(1)(A) requires “actual knowledge,” I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.

															I

															We should dismiss this case for the reasons we gave in City and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan,

575 U.S. 600 (2015), and Yee v. Escondido,

503 U.S. 519 (1992).  In Sheehan, we granted review to resolve a Circuit split and decide whether the Americans with Disabilities Act requires law enforcement officers to provide reasonable accommodations to armed, violent, and mentally ill criminals while arresting them.  575 U. S., at 608.  But after the petitioners’ opening brief “effectively concede[d]” that it may and pressed a narrower, “qualified” version of the original argument, id., at 609, we dismissed the case for lack of “adversary presentation” of the question presented, id., at 610.  In Yee, the petitioner raised an argument that was not clearly pressed or passed upon below, that was not the subject of a known circuit split, and that, in fact, no court in the country had squarely addressed before.  See 503 U. S., at 534, 537–538.  We declined to “be the first court in the Nation” to decide the petitioner’s novel legal question.  Id., at 538.

															These considerations counsel dismissal here.  First, Unicolors has abandoned the actual question presented and now presses novel arguments in favor of reversal.  We took this case to resolve an apparent split between the Eleventh Circuit, which has held that §411(b)(1)(A) requires “deceptive intent,” Roberts v. Gordy, 877 F.3d 1024, 1030 (2017), and the Ninth Circuit, which held below that “there is no such intent-to-defraud requirement,” 959 F.3d 1194, 1198 (2020) (citing Gold Value Int’l Textile, Inc. v. Sanctuary Clothing, LLC, 925 F.3d 1140, 1147 (CA9 2019)).  Agreeing with the Eleventh Circuit, Unicolors argued in its petition for certiorari that “knowledge” requires “inten[t] to defraud.”  Pet. for Cert. 7.  But now, siding with the Ninth Circuit, Unicolors contends that a mere “knowing failure” satisfies §411(b)(1)(A).  Brief for Petitioner 33, 37 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The United States, as amicus supporting Unicolors, agrees.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25, n. 5.  And, obviously, so does H&M.  See Brief for Respondent 1.  Thus, no party or amicus before us supports the Eleventh Circuit’s position.  Without “adversary presentation” on the actual question presented, we should dismiss.  Sheehan, 575 U. S., at 610.

															Second, as in Yee, Unicolors’ new merits-stage arguments present novel legal questions.  Unicolors claims that “knowledge” in §411(b)(1)(A) is satisfied only by actual knowledge (i.e., an applicant subjectively knew of an inaccuracy) rather than actual or constructive knowledge (i.e., an applicant should have known of an inaccuracy).  It further contends that a copyright applicant must actually know that it is misapplying a legal standard rather than simply misstating the facts.

															It is undisputed that Unicolors raised neither point below.  It is also undisputed that there is no circuit split on either of Unicolors’ new arguments.  And it is clear that the Court of Appeals did not meaningfully consider these questions.  It said nothing about actual versus constructive knowledge, see 959 F. 3d, at 1200, and it merely implied, in a cursory sentence, that §411(b)(1)(A) requires knowledge of facts and not law, see ante, at 9 (citing 959 F. 3d, at 1200).  Other than this halfway relevant and completely unreasoned statement, the Court cites no other opinion from any court that interprets §411(b)(1)(A).  Thus, we are the “first court in the Nation” to decide the important questions that Unicolors belatedly presents.  Yee, 503 U. S., at 538.  I would decline the invitation to take that imprudent step.

															The Court disputes none of this.  Instead, it reasons that Unicolors’ new arguments are “ ‘fairly included’ ” in the question presented because, even though Unicolors originally proposed a fraud standard, it now argues for at least an element of that standard: actual knowledge of a misrepresentation.  Ante, at 9 (quoting this Court’s Rule 14.1(a)).The Court misapplies Rule 14.1(a).  An argument is “fairly included” only if it raises a “prior question.”  Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation,

513 U.S. 374, 381 (1995).  That is, resolving the new argument must be “a predicate to an intelligent resolution of the question presented.”  Ohio v. Robinette,

519 U.S. 33, 38 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, to decide whether §411(b)(1)(A) requires fraud, we do not first need to decide what kind of knowledge fraud requires.  To the contrary, it makes more sense to establish the correct legal standard before deciding what satisfies its elements.  Cf. Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U. S. ___, ___–___, n. 1 (2017) (slip op., at 2–3, n. 1) (Alito, J., dissenting).  This case proves the point: Unicolors effectively concedes that §411(b)(1)(A) has no fraudulent-intent requirement and then asks us to hold that the provision nevertheless requires actual rather than constructive knowledge, and knowledge of legal and factual misstatements rather than knowledge of factual misstatements alone.  Evidently, Unicolors can discern whether the statute requires fraud without addressing those questions.  Likewise, the Ninth Circuit has held that §411(b)(1)(A) does not require fraud based on its “plain language.”  Gold Value, 925 F. 3d, at 1147.  In reaching that conclusion, the Court of Appeals did not address the actual-versus-constructive-knowledge issue, and it reserved the law-versus-fact issue.  See ibid.  In short, deciding whether §411(b)(1)(A) requires a particular element of fraud is not “prior” to deciding whether fraud is the proper standard in the first place.

															But even if Unicolors’ arguments were “prior” questions, the Court still misapplies Rule 14.1(a).  We are free to address “subsidiary question[s]” in deciding “any question presented.”  This Court’s Rule 14.1(a) (emphasis added).  Put another way, the subsidiary questions must be “inextricably linked” to the question under review and necessarily contribute to that question’s resolution.  City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y.,

544 U.S. 197, 214, n. 8 (2005).  Here, though, the Court never answers the ultimate question about fraud.  To provide an incomplete answer to the question presented disserves the public and our fellow judges.  The Court does not decide the question that has split the Courts of Appeals, but instead decides a question that no court has addressed.  And by granting review of one question but answering another, we encourage litigants “to seek review of a circuit conflict only then to change the question to one that seems more favorable.”  Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2); see also Yee, 503 U. S., at 536 (parties would be “encouraged to fill their limited briefing space and argument time with discussion of issues other than the one on which certiorari was granted”).  The result is muddled briefing on questions we did not agree to resolve, and a ruling that bypasses the ordinary process of appellate review.

															II

															In this case, the Court’s misstep comes at considerable cost.  A requirement to know the law is ordinarily satisfied by constructive knowledge, cf. Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A.,

559 U.S. 573, 584 (2010), because “actual knowledge of illegality” can be “difficult or impossible” to prove, Ratzlaf v. United States,

510 U.S. 135, 162 (1994) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Yet here, the Court imposes an actual-knowledge-of-law standard that is virtually unprecedented except in criminal tax enforcement.  See Cheek v. United States,

498 U.S. 192, 201–203 (1991).  And while the Court claims the word “knowledge” in §411(b)(1)(A) compels this conclusion, see ante, at 5, that result is far from certain.  In Cheek, this Court required actual knowledge of law in light of a “willfulness” requirement.  498 U. S., at 201–202.  A “knowledge” requirement, by contrast, often encompasses actual and constructive knowledge.  See Intel Corp. Investment Policy Comm. v. Sulyma, 589 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2020) (slip op., at 6–7).  Moreover, as the Court recognizes, the other knowledge requirements in the Copyright Act are satisfied by either kind of knowledge.  See ante, at 6.  The Court points to no other Copyright Act provision that is satisfied by actual knowledge alone.  That the Court reads §411(b)(1)(A) to be the lone exception is dubious.  That the Court does so without permitting any other court in the country to first consider the question is unwise.

															*  *  *

															I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted because Unicolors has abandoned the question presented and instead proposes novel questions of copyright law that no other court addressed before today.  I respectfully dissent.
