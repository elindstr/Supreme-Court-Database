															KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of montana

															[June 30, 2020]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring.

															The Court correctly concludes that Montana’s no-aid provision expressly discriminates against religion in violation of the Free Exercise Clause.  And it properly provides relief to Montana religious schools and the petitioners who wish to use Montana’s scholarship program to send their children to such schools.  I write separately to explain how this Court’s interpretation of the Establishment Clause continues to hamper free exercise rights.  Until we correct course on that interpretation, individuals will continue to face needless obstacles in their attempts to vindicate their religious freedom.

															I

															A

															This case involves the Free Exercise Clause, not the Establishment Clause.  But as in all cases involving a state actor, the modern understanding of the Establishment Clause is a “brooding omnipresence,” Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen,

244 U.S. 205, 222 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting), ever ready to be used to justify the government’s infringement on religious freedom.  Under the modern, but erroneous, view of the Establishment Clause, the government must treat all religions equally and treat religion equally to nonreligion.  As this Court stated in its first case applying the Establishment Clause to the States, the government cannot “pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another.”  Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,

330 U.S. 1, 15 (1947); see also post, at 3 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  This “equality principle,” the theory goes, prohibits the government from expressing any preference for religion—or even permitting any signs of religion in the governmental realm.  Thus, when a plaintiff brings a free exercise claim, the government may defend its law, as Montana did here, on the ground that the law’s restrictions are required to prevent it from “establishing” religion.

															This understanding of the Establishment Clause is unmoored from the original meaning of the
 
First Amendment.  As I have explained in previous cases, at the founding, the Clause served only to “protec[t] States, and by extension their citizens, from the imposition of an established religion by the Federal Government.”  Zelman v. Simmons-Harris,

536 U.S. 639, 678 (2002) (Thomas, J., concurring) (emphasis added); see also, e.g., Town of Greece v. Galloway,

572 U.S. 565, 604–607 (2014) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow,

542 U.S. 1, 49–50 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  Under this view, the Clause resists incorporation against the States.  See Town of Greece, 572 U. S., at 604 (opinion of Thomas, J.).

															There is mixed historical evidence concerning whether the Establishment Clause was understood as an individual right at the time of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment’s ratification.  Id., at 607–608.  Even assuming that the Clause creates a right and that such a right could be incorporated, however, it would only protect against an “establishment” of religion as understood at the founding, i.e., “ ‘coercion of religious orthodoxy and of financial support by force of law and threat of penalty.’ ”  Id., at 608 (quoting Lee v. Weisman, 

505 U.S. 577, 640 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting); emphasis deleted); American Legion v. American Humanist Assn., 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3); see also McConnell, Establishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, Part I: Establishment of Religion, 44 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 2105, 2131–2181 (2003); McConnell, Coercion: The Lost Element of Establishment, 27 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 933, 936–939 (1986).[1]

															Thus, the modern view, which presumes that States must remain both completely separate from and virtually silent on matters of religion to comply with the Establishment Clause, is fundamentally incorrect.  Properly understood, the Establishment Clause does not prohibit States from favoring religion.  They can legislate as they wish, subject only to the limitations in the State and Federal Constitutions.  See Muñoz, The Original Meaning of the Establishment Clause and the Impossibility of Its Incorporation, 8 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 585, 632 (2006).

															B

															I have previously made these points in Establishment Clause cases to show that the Clause likely has no application to the States or, if it is capable of incorporation, that the Court employs a far broader test than the Clause’s original meaning.  See, e.g., American Legion, 588 U. S., at ___ (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1); Town of Greece, 572 U. S., at 604 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  But the Court’s wayward approach to the Establishment Clause also impacts its free exercise jurisprudence.  Specifically, its overly expansive understanding of the former Clause has led to a correspondingly cramped interpretation of the latter.

															Under this Court’s current approach, state and local governments may rely on the Establishment Clause to justify policies that others wish to challenge as violations of the Free Exercise Clause.  Once the government demonstrates that its policy is required for compliance with the Constitution, any claim that the policy infringes on free exercise cannot survive.  A few examples suffice to illustrate this practice.

															Of most relevance to this case is Locke v. Davey,

540 U.S. 712 (2004), which Montana principally relies on to justify its discriminatory law.  In Locke, the Court held that prohibiting a student from using a generally available state scholarship to pursue a degree in devotional theology did not violate the student’s free exercise rights.  This was so, the Court said, in part because it furthered the State’s “antiestablishment interests” in avoiding the education of religious ministers.  Id., at 722.  But no antiestablishment interests, properly understood, were at issue in Locke.  The State neither coerced students to study devotional theology nor conscripted taxpayers into supporting any form of orthodoxy.  Thus, as I have explained, Locke incorrectly interpreted the Establishment Clause and should not impact free exercise challenges.  Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (Thomas, J., concurring).  Yet, as Montana’s proffered justification for its law shows, governments continue to rely on Locke’s improper understanding of “antiestablishment interests” to defend against free exercise challenges.  See Brief for State of Colorado et al. as Amici Curiae 3, 10–12 (arguing that Locke justifies the 38 state constitutional provisions that are similar to Montana’s); see also Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Pauley, 788 F.3d 779, 785 (CA8 2015), rev’d and remanded, 582 U. S. ___; Eulitt v. Maine, 386 F.3d 344, 354 (CA1 2004); post, at 5–8 (Breyer, J., dissenting); post, at 9–10 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).

															The Court has also repeatedly stated that a government has a compelling interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation altogether, which “may justify” abridging other
 
First Amendment freedoms.  See Good News Club v. Milford Central School,

533 U.S. 98, 112 (2001); Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.,

508 U.S. 384, 394 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent,

454 U.S. 263, 271 (1981).  Unsurprisingly, governmental employers have relied on these pronouncements to defeat challenges from employees who alleged violations of their
 
First Amendment rights.  See, e.g., Berry v. Department of Social Servs., 447 F.3d 642, 650–651 (CA9 2006); Knight v. Connecticut Dept. of Public Health, 275 F.3d 156, 166 (CA2 2001); Marchi v. Board of Cooperative Ed. Servs. of Albany, 173 F.3d 469, 475 (CA2 1999).

															Finally, this Court’s infamous test in Lemon v. Kurtzman,

403 U.S. 602 (1971), has sometimes been understood to prohibit governmental practices that have the effect of endorsing religion.  See Lynch v. Donnelly,

465 U.S. 668, 692 (1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring).  This, too, presupposes that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from favoring religion or taking steps to promote it.  But as described supra, at 2–3, the Establishment Clause does nothing of the sort.  The concern with avoiding endorsement has nevertheless been used to prohibit voluntary practices that potentially implicate free exercise rights, with courts and governments going so far as to make the “remarkable” suggestion “that even while off duty, a teacher or coach cannot engage in any outward manifestation of religious faith.”  Kennedy v. Bremerton School Dist., 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 5) (Alito, J., concurring in denial of certiorari); see Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe,

530 U.S. 290, 308 (2000) (voluntary decision to begin football games with a prayer violated the Establishment Clause); see also Kennedy v. Bremerton School Dist., 869 F.3d 813, 831 (CA9 2017) (M. Smith, J., concurring) (coach’s decision to lead voluntary prayer after football games); Walz v. Egg Harbor Twp. Bd. of Ed., 342 F.3d 271, 280 (CA3 2003) (student’s decision to distribute small gifts with religious messages to classmates).

															II

															The Court’s current understanding of the Establishment Clause actually thwarts, rather than promotes, equal treatment of religion.  Under a proper understanding of the Establishment Clause, robust and lively debate about the role of religion in government is permitted, even encouraged, at the state and local level.  The Court’s distorted view of the Establishment Clause, however, removes the entire subject of religion from the realm of permissible governmental activity, instead mandating strict separation.

															This interpretation of the Establishment Clause operates as a type of content-based restriction on the government.  The Court has interpreted the Free Speech Clause to prohibit content-based restrictions because they “value some forms of speech over others,” City of Ladue v. Gilleo,

512 U.S. 43, 60 (1994) (O’Connor, J., concurring), thus tending to “tilt public debate in a preferred direction,” Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.,

564 U.S. 552, 578–579 (2011).  The content-based restriction imposed by this Court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence operates no differently.  It communicates a message that religion is dangerous and in need of policing, which in turn has the effect of tilting society in favor of devaluing religion.

															Historical evidence suggests that many advocates for this separationist view were originally motivated by hostility toward certain disfavored religions.  See P. Hamburger, Separation of Church and State 391–454 (2002).  And this Court’s adoption of a separationist interpretation has itself sometimes bordered on religious hostility.  Justice Black, well known for his role in formulating the Court’s modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence, once described Catholic petitioners as “powerful sectarian religious propagandists” “looking toward complete domination and supremacy” of their “preferences and prejudices.”  Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen,

392 U.S. 236, 251 (1968) (dissenting opinion).  Other Members of the Court have characterized religions as “divisive forces.”  Edwards v. Aguillard,

482 U.S. 578, 584 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted); Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens,

496 U.S. 226, 287 (1990) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted); Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign Cty.,

333 U.S. 203, 231 (1948) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  And the Court once described a statute permitting employees to request accommodations to avoid work on the Sabbath as “arm[ing]” religious employees with the “absolute and unqualified right” to pursue their religion “over all other . . . interests.”  Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc.,

472 U.S. 703, 709–711 (1985).  The siren song of religion is apparently so strong that we once held that public school teachers cannot provide assistance at parochial schools, lest they “subtly (or overtly) conform their instruction to the environment in which they teach.”  School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball,

473 U.S. 373, 388 (1985), overruled by Agostini v. Felton,

521 U.S. 203, 235 (1997).  In the Court’s view, “[t]he ‘atmosphere’ of a Catholic school ha[d] such power to influence the unsuspecting mind that it may move even public school . . . specialists to ‘conform’—though their only contact with the school is to walk down its halls.”  McConnell, Religious Freedom at a Crossroads, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 115, 122 (1992).

															Although such hostility may not be overtly expressed by the Court any longer, manifestations of this “trendy disdain for deep religious conviction” assuredly live on.  Locke, 540 U. S., at 733 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  They are evident in the fact that, unlike other constitutional rights, the mere exposure to religion can render an “ ‘offended observer’ ” sufficiently injured to bring suit against the government, American Legion, 588 U. S., at ___ (Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2), even if he has not been coerced in any way to participate in a religious practice, Lee, 505 U. S., at 584; Engel v. Vitale,

370 U.S. 421, 430 (1962).[2]  We also see them in the special privilege of taxpayer standing in Establishment Clause challenges, even though such suits directly contravene Article III’s restrictions on standing.  See Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc.,

551 U.S. 587, 618 (2007) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also Bowen v. Kendrick,

487 U.S. 589, 618–620 (1988); Flast v. Cohen,

392 U.S. 83, 102–104 (1968).  And they persist in the repeated denigration of those who continue to adhere to traditional moral standards, as well as laws even remotely influenced by such standards, as outmoded at best and bigoted at worst.  See Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm’n, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 14); Obergefell v. Hodges,

576 U.S. 644, 712 (2015) (Roberts, C. J., dissenting).  So long as this hostility remains, fostered by our distorted understanding of the Establishment Clause, free exercise rights will continue to suffer.

															*  *  *

															As I have recently explained, this Court has an unfortunate tendency to prefer certain constitutional rights over others.  See United States v. Sineneng-Smith, ante, at 6 (Thomas, J., concurring).  The Free Exercise Clause, although enshrined explicitly in the Constitution, rests on the lowest rung of the Court’s ladder of rights, and precariously so at that.  Returning the Establishment Clause to its proper scope will not completely rectify the Court’s disparate treatment of constitutional rights, but it will go a long way toward allowing free exercise of religion to flourish as the Framers intended.  I look forward to the day when the Court takes up this task in earnest.
Notes
1
 A party wishing to expand the scope of the Establishment Clause beyond its meaning at the founding carries the burden of demonstrating that this broader reading is historically sound.  Town of Greece v. Galloway,

572 U.S. 565, 607–608 (2014) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). 

2
 This stands in striking contrast to the Court’s view in the free speech context that “the burden normally falls upon the viewer” to avoid offense “simply by averting his eyes.”  Hill v. Colorado,

530 U.S. 703, 753, n. 3 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting Erznoznik v. Jacksonville,

422 U.S. 205, 210–211 (1975); quotation altered)).
