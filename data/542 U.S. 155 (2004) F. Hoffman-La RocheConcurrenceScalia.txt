SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-724





															F. HOFFMANN-La ROCHE LTD., et al., PETITIONERS v. EMPAGRAN S.A. et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

															[June 14, 2004]



															   Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment.

															
   I concur in the judgment of the Court because the language of the statute is readily susceptible of the interpretation the Court provides and because only that interpretation is consistent with the principle that statutes should be read in accord with the customary deference to the application of foreign countries’ laws within their own territories.
