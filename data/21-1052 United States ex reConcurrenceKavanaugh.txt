															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															No. 21–1052

															_________________

															UNITED STATES, ex rel. JESSE POLANSKY,
M.D., M.P.H., PETITIONER v. EXECUTIVE HEALTH RESOURCES,
INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the third circuit

															[June 16, 2023]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, with whom Justice Barrett
joins, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full. I add
only that I agree with Justice Thomas that “[t]here are
substantial arguments that the qui tam device is
inconsistent with Article II and that private relators may not
represent the interests of the United States in litigation.”
Post, at 7–8 (dissenting opinion). In my view, the
Court should consider the competing arguments on the Article II
issue in an appropriate case.
