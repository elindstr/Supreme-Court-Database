OPINION OF THOMAS, J.
SHEPARD V. UNITED STATES
544 U. S. ____ (2005)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-9168

															REGINALD SHEPARD, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the first circuit

															[March 7, 2005]

															   Justice Thomas, concurring in
part and concurring in the judgment.

															   Apprendi v. New
Jersey, 530 U.
S. 466 (2000), and its progeny prohibit judges from
“mak[ing] a finding that raises [a defendant’s]
sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed
by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the
defendant.” United States v. Booker, 543 U.
S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 5) (Thomas, J., dissenting in
part). Yet that is what the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.
S. C. §924(e) (2000 ed., Supp. II), permits in this case.
Petitioner Reginald Shepard pleaded guilty to being a felon in
possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U. S. C.
§922(g)(1), which exposed him to a maximum sentence of 10
years under §924(a)(2) and a Federal Sentencing Guidelines
range of 30-to-37 months. However, §924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp.
II) mandated a minimum 15-year sentence if Shepard had three
previous convictions for “a violent felony or a serious drug
offense.” Shepard has never conceded that his prior
state-court convictions qualify as violent felonies or serious drug
offenses under §924(e). Even so, the Court of Appeals resolved
this contested factual matter by ordering the District Court to
impose the enhancement on remand.

															   The constitutional infirmity of
§924(e)(1) as applied to Shepard makes today’s decision
an unnecessary exercise. Nevertheless, the plurality today refines
the rule of Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990),
and further instructs district courts on the evidence they may
consider in determining whether prior state convictions are
§924(e) predicate offenses. Taylor and today’s
decision thus explain to lower courts how to conduct factfinding
that is, according to the logic of this Court’s intervening
precedents, unconstitutional in this very case. The need for
further refinement of Taylor endures because this Court
has not yet reconsidered Almendarez-Torres v. United
States, 523 U.
S. 224 (1998), which draws an exception to the
Apprendi line of cases for judicial factfinding that
concerns a defendant’s prior convictions. See
Apprendi, supra, at 487–490.

															   Almendarez-Torres, like
Taylor, has been eroded by this Court’s subsequent
Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, and a majority of the Court now
recognizes that Almendarez-Torres was wrongly decided. See
523 U. S., at 248–249 (Scalia, J., joined by Stevens, Souter,
and Ginsburg, JJ., dissenting); Apprendi, supra,
at 520–521 (Thomas, J., concurring). The parties do not
request it here, but in an appropriate case, this Court should
consider Almendarez-Torres’ continuing viability.
Innumerable criminal defendants have been unconstitutionally
sentenced under the flawed rule of Almendarez-Torres,
despite the fundamental “imperative that the Court maintain
absolute fidelity to the protections of the individual afforded by
the notice, trial by jury, and beyond-a-reasonable-doubt
requirements.” Harris v. United States,
536 U. S. 545,
581–582 (2002) (Thomas, J., dissenting).

															   In my view, broadening the evidence judges may
consider when finding facts under Taylor—by
permitting sentencing courts to look beyond charging papers, jury
instructions, and plea agreements to an assortment of other
documents such as complaint applications and police
reports—would not give rise to constitutional doubt, as the
plurality believes. See ante, at 10–11. It would
give rise to constitutional error, no less than does the limited
factfinding that Taylor’s rule permits. For this
reason, as well as those set forth in Parts I, II, and IV of the
Court’s opinion, the Court correctly declines to broaden the
scope of the evidence judges may consider under Taylor.
But because the factfinding procedure the Court rejects gives rise
to constitutional error, not doubt, I cannot join Part III of the
opinion.
