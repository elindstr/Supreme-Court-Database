ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
Syllabus 

															An averment that the plaintiff is "a citizen of London, England," is not sufficient to give the circuit court jurisdiction on the ground of his alienage, the defendant being a citizen, and on the question being raised in this Court, the case may be remanded with leave to apply to the circuit court for amendment and for further proceedings.

															The case is stated in the opinion.

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER.

															Plaintiff in error is described throughout the record as "a citizen of London, England," and the defendants as "corporations of the State of Pennsylvania."  As the jurisdiction of the circuit court confessedly depended
