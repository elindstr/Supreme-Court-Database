															v.

															HUMPHREY DANIELS, III

															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the armed forces

															 [December 10, 2020]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, concurring.

															I continue to think this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals directly from the CAAF.  See Ortiz v. United States, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (Alito, J., dissenting).  But a majority of the Court believes we have jurisdiction, and I agree with the Court’s decision on the merits.  I therefore join the Court’s opinion.
