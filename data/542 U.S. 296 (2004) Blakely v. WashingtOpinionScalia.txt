OPINION OF THE COURT
BLAKELY V. WASHINGTON
542 U. S. ____ (2004)
 
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 02-1632

															RALPH HOWARD BLAKELY, Jr., PETITIONER
v. WASHINGTON

															on writ of certiorari to the court of
appeals of washington, division 3

															[June 24, 2004]

															
Â Â Â Justice Scalia delivered the
opinion of the Court.

															
Â Â Â Petitioner Ralph Howard
Blakely, Jr., pleaded guilty to the kidnaping of his estranged
wife. The facts admitted in his plea, standing alone, supported a
maximum sentence of 53 months. Pursuant to state law, the court
imposed an â€œexceptionalâ€ sentence of
90 months after making a judicial determination that he had acted
with â€œdeliberate cruelty.â€ App. 40,
49. We consider whether this violated
petitionerâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to trial by
jury.

															I

															
Â Â Â Petitioner married his wife
Yolanda in 1973. He was evidently a difficult man to live with,
having been diagnosed at various times with psychological and
personality disorders including paranoid schizophrenia. His wife
ultimately filed for divorce. In 1998, he abducted her from their
orchard home in Grant County, Washington, binding her with duct
tape and forcing her at knifepoint into a wooden box in the bed of
his pickup truck. In the process, he implored her to dismiss the
divorce suit and related trust proceedings.

															
Â Â Â When the
coupleâ€™s 13-year-old son Ralphy returned home
from school, petitioner ordered him to follow in another car,
threatening to harm Yolanda with a shotgun if he did not do so.
Ralphy escaped and sought help when they stopped at a gas station,
but petitioner continued on with Yolanda to a
friendâ€™s house in Montana. He was finally
arrested after the friend called the police.

															Â Â Â The State charged
petitioner with first-degree kidnaping, Wash. Rev. Code Ann.
Â§9 A. 40.020(1) (2000).[Footnote 1]
Upon reaching a plea agreement, however, it reduced the charge to
second-degree kidnaping involving domestic violence and use of a
firearm, see Â§Â§9 A. 40.030(1),
10.99.020(3)(p), 9.94 A. 125.[Footnote 2]
Petitioner entered a guilty plea admitting the elements of
second-degree kidnaping and the domestic-violence and firearm
allegations, but no other relevant facts.

															Â Â Â The case then proceeded
to sentencing. In Washington, second-degree kidnaping is a class B
felony. Â§9 A. 40.030(3). State law provides that
â€œ[n]o person convicted of a [class B] felony
shall be punished by confinement â€¦ exceeding
â€¦ a term of ten years.â€
Â§9 A. 20.021(1)(b). Other provisions of state law,
however, further limit the range of sentences a judge may impose.
Washingtonâ€™s Sentencing Reform Act specifies,
for petitionerâ€™s offense of second-degree
kidnaping with a firearm, a â€œstandard
rangeâ€ of 49 to 53 months. See Â§9.94 A. 320
(seriousness level V for second-degree kidnaping); App. 27
(offender score 2 based on Â§9.94A.360);
Â§9.94A.310(1), box 2â€“V (standard
range of 13â€“17 months);
Â§9.94A.310(3)(b) (36-month firearm
enhancement).[Footnote 3] A judge may impose a
sentence above the standard range if he finds
â€œsubstantial and compelling reasons justifying
an exceptional sentence.â€ Â§9.94A.120(2).
The Act lists aggravating factors that justify such a departure,
which it recites to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.
Â§9.94 A. 390. Nevertheless, â€œ[a]
reason offered to justify an exceptional sentence can be considered
only if it takes into account factors other than those which are
used in computing the standard range sentence for the
offense.â€ State v. Gore, 143 Wash. 2d
288, 315â€“316, 21 P.Â 3d 262, 277
(2001). When a judge imposes an exceptional sentence, he must set
forth findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting it.
Â§9.94A.120(3). A reviewing court will reverse the
sentence if it finds that â€œunder a clearly
erroneous standard there is insufficient evidence in the record to
support the reasons for imposing an exceptional
sentence.â€ Gore, supra, at 315, 21
P.Â 3d, at 277 (citing Â§9.94A.210(4)).

															Â Â Â Pursuant to the plea
agreement, the State recommended a sentence within the standard
range of 49 to 53 months. After hearing
Yolandaâ€™s description of the kidnaping, however,
the judge rejected the Stateâ€™s recommendation
and imposed an exceptional sentence of 90
monthsâ€”37 months beyond the standard maximum. He
justified the sentence on the ground that petitioner had acted with
â€œdeliberate cruelty,â€ a statutorily
enumerated ground for departure in domestic-violence cases.
Â§9.94A.390(2)(h)(iii).[Footnote
4]

															Â Â Â Faced with an unexpected
increase of more than three years in his sentence, petitioner
objected. The judge accordingly conducted a 3-day bench hearing
featuring testimony from petitioner, Yolanda, Ralphy, a police
officer, and medical experts. After the hearing, he issued 32
findings of fact, concluding:

															
Â Â Â â€œThe
defendantâ€™s motivation to commit kidnapping was
complex, contributed to by his mental condition and personality
disorders, the pressures of the divorce litigation, the impending
trust litigation trial and anger over his troubled interpersonal
relationships with his spouse and children. While he misguidedly
intended to forcefully reunite his family, his attempt to do so was
subservient to his desire to terminate lawsuits and modify title
ownerships to his benefit.

															Â Â Â â€œThe
defendantâ€™s methods were more homogeneous than
his motive. He used stealth and surprise, and took advantage of the
victimâ€™s isolation. He immediately employed
physical violence, restrained the victim with tape, and threatened
her with injury and death to herself and others. He immediately
coerced the victim into providing information by the threatening
application of a knife. He violated a subsisting restraining
order.â€ App. 48â€“49.

															The judge adhered to his initial
determination of deliberate cruelty.

															Â Â Â Petitioner appealed,
arguing that this sentencing procedure deprived him of his federal
constitutional right to have a jury determine beyond a reasonable
doubt all facts legally essential to his sentence. The State Court
of Appeals affirmed, 111 Wash. App. 851,
870â€“871, 47 P.Â 3d 149, 159 (2002),
relying on the Washington Supreme Courtâ€™s
rejection of a similar challenge in Gore, supra,
at 311â€“315, 21 P.Â 3d, at
275â€“277. The Washington Supreme Court denied
discretionary review. 148 Wash. 2d 1010, 62 P.Â 3d 889
(2003). We granted certiorari. 540 U. S. 965
(2003).

															II

															
Â Â Â This case requires us to
apply the rule we expressed in Apprendi v. New
Jersey, 530 U.
S. 466, 490 (2000): â€œOther than the fact of
a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime
beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a
jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.â€ This rule
reflects two longstanding tenets of common-law criminal
jurisprudence: that the â€œtruth of every
accusationâ€ against a defendant
â€œshould afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous
suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours,â€ 4 W.
Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769), and
that â€œan accusation which lacks any particular
fact which the law makes essential to the punishment is
â€¦ no accusation within the requirements of the
common law, and it is no accusation in reason,â€ 1 J.
Bishop, Criminal Procedure Â§87, p. 55 (2d ed.
1872).[Footnote 5] These principles have been
acknowledged by courts and treatises since the earliest days of
graduated sentencing; we compiled the relevant authorities in
Apprendi, see 530 U. S., at 476â€“483,
489â€“490, n.Â 15; id., at
501â€“518 (Thomas, J., concurring), and need not
repeat them here.[Footnote 6]

															
Â Â Â Apprendi involved a
New Jersey hate-crime statute that authorized a 20-year sentence,
despite the usual 10-year maximum, if the judge found the crime to
have been committed
â€œÂ â€˜with a purpose
to intimidate â€¦ because of race, color, gender,
handicap, religion, sexual orientation or
ethnicity.â€™Â â€
Id., at 468â€“469 (quoting
N.Â J. Stat. Ann.
Â§2C:44â€“3(e) (West Supp.
1999â€“2000)). In Ring v.
Arizona, 536 U. S. 584,
592â€“593, and n.Â 1 (2002), we applied
Apprendi to an Arizona law that authorized the death
penalty if the judge found one of ten aggravating factors. In each
case, we concluded that the defendantâ€™s
constitutional rights had been violated because the judge had
imposed a sentence greater than the maximum he could have imposed
under state law without the challenged factual finding.
Apprendi, supra, at 491â€“497;
Ring, supra, at 603â€“609.

															Â Â Â In this case, petitioner
was sentenced to more than three years above the 53-month statutory
maximum of the standard range because he had acted with
â€œdeliberate cruelty.â€ The facts
supporting that finding were neither admitted by petitioner nor
found by a jury. The State nevertheless contends that there was no
Apprendi violation because the relevant
â€œstatutory maximumâ€ is not 53
months, but the 10-year maximum for class B felonies in
Â§9 A. 20.021(1)(b). It observes that no exceptional
sentence may exceed that limit. See Â§9.94 A. 420. Our
precedents make clear, however, that the
â€œstatutory maximumâ€ for
Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may
impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in
the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. See
Ring, supra, at 602
(â€œÂ â€˜the maximum
he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in
the jury verdict
aloneâ€™Â â€ (quoting
Apprendi, supra, at 483)); Harris v.
United States, 536 U. S. 545, 563
(2002) (plurality opinion) (same); cf. Apprendi,
supra, at 488 (facts admitted by the defendant). In other
words, the relevant â€œstatutory
maximumâ€ is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose
after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose
without any additional findings. When a judge inflicts
punishment that the juryâ€™s verdict alone does
not allow, the jury has not found all the facts
â€œwhich the law makes essential to the
punishment,â€ Bishop, supra, Â§87,
at 55, and the judge exceeds his proper authority.

															Â Â Â The judge in this case
could not have imposed the exceptional 90-month sentence solely on
the basis of the facts admitted in the guilty plea. Those facts
alone were insufficient because, as the Washington Supreme Court
has explained, â€œ[a] reason offered to justify an
exceptional sentence can be considered only if it takes into
account factors other than those which are used in computing the
standard range sentence for the offense,â€
Gore, 143 Wash. 2d, at 315â€“316, 21
P.Â 3d, at 277, which in this case included the elements
of second-degree kidnaping and the use of a firearm, see
Â§Â§9.94 A. 320, 9.94A.310(3)(b).[Footnote 7] Had the judge imposed the 90-month sentence
solely on the basis of the plea, he would have been reversed. See
Â§9.94A.210(4). The â€œmaximum
sentenceâ€ is no more 10 years here than it was 20 years
in Apprendi (because that is what the judge could have
imposed upon finding a hate crime) or death in Ring
(because that is what the judge could have imposed upon finding an
aggravator).

															Â Â Â The State defends the
sentence by drawing an analogy to those we upheld in
McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), and
Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949).
Neither case is on point. McMillan involved a sentencing
scheme that imposed a statutory minimum if a judge found a
particular fact. 477 U. S., at 81. We specifically noted that the
statute â€œdoes not authorize a sentence in excess
of that otherwise allowed for [the underlying]
offense.â€ Id., at 82; cf. Harris,
supra, at 567. Williams involved an
indeterminate-sentencing regime that allowed a judge (but did not
compel him) to rely on facts outside the trial record in
determining whether to sentence a defendant to death. 337 U. S., at
242â€“243, and n.Â 2. The judge could
have â€œsentenced [the defendant] to death giving
no reason at all.â€ Id., at 252. Thus, neither
case involved a sentence greater than what state law authorized on
the basis of the verdict alone.

															Â Â Â Finally, the State tries
to distinguish Apprendi and Ring by pointing out
that the enumerated grounds for departure in its regime are
illustrative rather than exhaustive. This distinction is
immaterial. Whether the judgeâ€™s authority to
impose an enhanced sentence depends on finding a specified fact (as
in Apprendi), one of several specified facts (as in
Ring), or any aggravating fact (as here), it
remains the case that the juryâ€™s verdict alone
does not authorize the sentence. The judge acquires that authority
only upon finding some additional fact.[Footnote
8]

															Â Â Â Because the
Stateâ€™s sentencing procedure did not com- ply
with the Sixth Amendment, petitionerâ€™s sentence
is invalid.[Footnote 9]

															III

															
Â Â Â Our commitment to
Apprendi in this context reflects not just respect for
longstanding precedent, but the need to give intelligible content
to the right of jury trial. That right is no mere procedural
formality, but a fundamental reservation of power in our
constitutional structure. Just as suffrage ensures the
peopleâ€™s ultimate control in the legislative and
executive branches, jury trial is meant to ensure their control in
the judiciary. See Letter XV by the Federal Farmer (Jan. 18, 1788),
reprinted in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 315, 320 (H. Storing
ed. 1981) (describing the jury as â€œsecur[ing] to
the people at large, their just and rightful controul in the
judicial departmentâ€); John Adams, Diary Entry (Feb.
12, 1771), reprinted in 2 Works of John Adams 252, 253 (C. Adams
ed. 1850) (â€œ[T]he common people, should have as
complete a control â€¦ in every judgment of a
court of judicatureâ€ as in the legislature); Letter
from Thomas Jefferson to the AbbÃ© Arnoux (July 19,
1789), reprinted in 15 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 282, 283 (J. Boyd
ed. 1958) (â€œWere I called upon to decide whether
the people had best be omitted in the Legislative or Judiciary
department, I would say it is better to leave them out of the
Legislativeâ€); Jones v. United
States, 526 U.
S. 227, 244â€“248 (1999). Apprendi
carries out this design by ensuring that the
judgeâ€™s authority to sentence derives wholly
from the juryâ€™s verdict. Without that
restriction, the jury would not exercise the control that the
Framers intended.

															
Â Â Â Those who would reject
Apprendi are resigned to one of two alternatives. The
first is that the jury need only find whatever facts the
legislature chooses to label elements of the crime, and that those
it labels sentencing factorsâ€”no matter how much
they may increase the punishmentâ€”may be found by
the judge. This would mean, for example, that a judge could
sentence a man for committing murder even if the jury convicted him
only of illegally possessing the firearm used to commit
itâ€”or of making an illegal lane change while
fleeing the death scene. Not even
Apprendiâ€™s critics would advocate this
absurd result. Cf. 530 U. S., at 552â€“553
(Oâ€™Connor, J., dissenting). The jury could not
function as circuitbreaker in the Stateâ€™s
machinery of justice if it were relegated to making a determination
that the defendant at some point did something wrong, a mere
preliminary to a judicial inquisition into the facts of the crime
the State actually seeks to punish.[Footnote 10]

															Â Â Â The second alternative is
that legislatures may establish legally essential sentencing
factors within limitsâ€”limits crossed
when, perhaps, the sentencing factor is a â€œtail
which wags the dog of the substantive offense.â€
McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88. What this means in operation
is that the law must not go too farâ€”it
must not exceed the judicial estimation of the proper role of the
judge.

															Â Â Â The subjectivity of this
standard is obvious. Petitioner argued below that second-degree
kidnaping with deliberate cruelty was essentially the same as
first-degree kidnaping, the very charge he had avoided by pleading
to a lesser offense. The court conceded this might be so but held
it irrelevant. See 111 Wash. App., at 869, 47 P.Â 3d, at
158.[Footnote 11]
Petitionerâ€™s 90-month sentence exceeded the
53-month standard maximum by almost 70%; the Washington Supreme
Court in other cases has upheld exceptional sentences 15 times the
standard maximum. See State v. Oxborrow,
106 Wash. 2d
525, 528, 533, 723 P.Â 2d 1123, 1125, 1128 (1986)
(15-year exceptional sentence; 1-year standard maximum sentence);
State v. Branch, 129 Wash. 2d 635, 650, 919
P.Â 2d 1228, 1235 (1996) (4-year exceptional sentence;
3-month standard maximum sentence). Did the court go too
far in any of these cases? There is no answer that legal
analysis can provide. With too far as the yardstick, it is
always possible to disagree with such judgments and never to refute
them.

															Â Â Â Whether the Sixth
Amendment incorporates this manipulable standard rather than
Apprendiâ€™s bright-line rule depends on
the plausibility of the claim that the Framers would have left
definition of the scope of jury power up to
judgesâ€™ intuitive sense of how far is too
far. We think that claim not plausible at all, because the
very reason the Framers put a jury-trial guarantee in the
Constitution is that they were unwilling to trust government to
mark out the role of the jury.

															IV

															
Â Â Â By reversing the judgment
below, we are not, as the State would have it,
â€œfind[ing] determinate sentencing schemes
unconstitutional.â€ Brief for Respondent 34. This case
is not about whether determinate sentencing is constitutional, only
about how it can be implemented in a way that respects the Sixth
Amendment. Several policies prompted
Washingtonâ€™s adoption of determinate sentencing,
including proportionality to the gravity of the offense and parity
among defendants. See Wash. Rev. Code Ann. Â§9.94 A. 010
(2000). Nothing we have said impugns those salutary objectives.

															
Â Â Â Justice
Oâ€™Connor argues that, because determinate
sentencing schemes involving judicial factfinding entail less
judicial discretion than indeterminate schemes, the
constitutionality of the latter implies the constitutionality of
the former. Post, at 1â€“10. This
argument is flawed on a number of levels. First, the Sixth
Amendment by its terms is not a limitation on judicial power, but a
reservation of jury power. It limits judicial power only to the
extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on the province of
the jury. Indeterminate sentencing does not do so. It increases
judicial discretion, to be sure, but not at the expense of the
juryâ€™s traditional function of finding the facts
essential to lawful imposition of the penalty. Of course
indeterminate schemes involve judicial factfinding, in that a judge
(like a parole board) may implicitly rule on those facts he deems
important to the exercise of his sentencing discretion. But the
facts do not pertain to whether the defendant has a legal
right to a lesser sentenceâ€”and that
makes all the difference insofar as judicial impingement upon the
traditional role of the jury is concerned. In a system that says
the judge may punish burglary with 10 to 40 years, every burglar
knows he is risking 40 years in jail. In a system that punishes
burglary with a 10-year sentence, with another 30 added for use of
a gun, the burglar who enters a home unarmed is entitled
to no more than a 10-year sentenceâ€”and by reason
of the Sixth Amendment the facts bearing upon that entitlement must
be found by a jury.

															Â Â Â But even assuming that
restraint of judicial power unrelated to the
juryâ€™s role is a Sixth Amendment objective, it
is far from clear that Apprendi disserves that goal.
Determinate judicial-factfinding schemes entail less judicial power
than indeterminate schemes, but more judicial power than
determinate jury-factfinding schemes. Whether
Apprendi increases judicial power overall depends on what
States with determinate judicial-factfinding schemes would do,
given the choice between the two alternatives. Justice
Oâ€™Connor simply assumes that the net effect will
favor judges, but she has no empirical basis for that prediction.
Indeed, what evidence we have points exactly the other way: When
the Kansas Supreme Court found Apprendi infirmities in
that Stateâ€™s determinate-sentencing regime in
State v. Gould, 271 Kan. 394,
404â€“414, 23 P.Â 3d 801,
809â€“814 (2001), the legislature responded not by
reestablishing indeterminate sentencing but by applying
Apprendiâ€™s requirements to its current
regime. See Act of May 29, 2002, ch. 170, 2002 Kan. Sess. Laws pp.
1018â€“1023 (codified at Kan.
Stat.Â Ann. Â§21â€“4718
(2003 Cum. Supp.)); Brief for Kansas Appellate Defender Office as
Amicus Curiae 3â€“7. The result was less,
not more, judicial power.

															Â Â Â Justice Breyer argues
that Apprendi works to the detriment of criminal
defendants who plead guilty by depriving them of the opportunity to
argue sentencing factors to a judge. Post, at
4â€“5. But nothing prevents a defendant from
waiving his Apprendi rights. When a defendant pleads
guilty, the State is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements so
long as the defendant either stipulates to the relevant facts or
consents to judicial factfinding. See Apprendi, 530 U. S.,
at 488; Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 158
(1968). If appropriate waivers are procured, States may continue to
offer judicial factfinding as a matter of course to all defendants
who plead guilty. Even a defendant who stands trial may consent to
judicial factfinding as to sentence enhancements, which may well be
in his interest if relevant evidence would prejudice him at trial.
We do not understand how Apprendi can possibly work to the
detriment of those who are free, if they think its costs outweigh
its benefits, to render it inapplicable.[Footnote
12]

															
Â Â Â Nor do we see any merit to
Justice Breyerâ€™s contention that
Apprendi is unfair to criminal defendants because, if
States respond by enacting â€œ17-element robbery
crime[s],â€ prosecutors will have more elements with
which to bargain. Post, at 4â€“5, 9
(citing Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding and Sentence Enhancements in a
World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L.Â J. 1097 (2001)).
Bargaining already exists with regard to sentencing factors because
defendants can either stipulate or contest the facts that make them
applicable. If there is any difference between bargaining over
sentencing factors and bargaining over elements, the latter
probably favors the defendant. Every new element that a prosecutor
can threaten to charge is also an element that a defendant can
threaten to contest at trial and make the prosecutor prove beyond a
reasonable doubt. Moreover, given the sprawling scope of most
criminal codes, and the power to affect sentences by making (even
nonbinding) sentencing recommendations, there is already no
shortage of in terrorem tools at
prosecutorsâ€™ disposal. See King & Klein,
Apprendi and Plea Bargaining, 54 Stan. L.Â Rev.
295, 296 (2001) (â€œEvery prosecutorial bargaining
chip mentioned by Professor Bibas existed pre-Apprendi
exactly as it does post-Apprendiâ€).

															Â Â Â Any evaluation of
Apprendiâ€™s
â€œfairnessâ€ to criminal defendants
must compare it with the regime it replaced, in which a defendant,
with no warning in either his indictment or plea, would routinely
see his maximum potential sentence balloon from as little as five
years to as much as life imprisonment, see 21 U. S.Â C.
Â§Â§841(b)(1)(A), (D),[Footnote 13] based not on facts proved to his peers
beyond a reasonable doubt, but on facts extracted after trial from
a report compiled by a probation officer who the judge thinks more
likely got it right than got it wrong. We can conceive of no
measure of fairness that would find more fault in the utterly
speculative bargaining effects Justice Breyer identifies than in
the regime he champions. Suffice it to say that, if such a measure
exists, it is not the one the Framers left us with.

															Â Â Â The implausibility of
Justice Breyerâ€™s contention that
Apprendi is unfair to criminal defendants is exposed by
the lineup of amici in this case. It is hard to believe
that the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers was
somehow duped into arguing for the wrong side. Justice
Breyerâ€™s only authority asking that defendants
be protected from Apprendi is an article written not by a
criminal defense lawyer but by a law professor and former
prosecutor. See post, at 4â€“5 (citing
Bibas, supra); Association of American Law Schools
Directory of Law Teachers 2003â€“2004, p. 319.

															Â Â Â Justice Breyer also
claims that Apprendi will attenuate the connection between
â€œreal criminal conduct and real
punishmentâ€ by encouraging plea bargaining and by
restricting alternatives to adversarial factfinding. Post,
at 7â€“8, 11â€“12. The short
answer to the former point (even assuming the questionable premise
that Apprendi does encourage plea bargaining, but see
supra, at 14, and n.Â 12) is that the Sixth
Amendment was not written for the benefit of those who choose to
forgo its protection. It guarantees the right to jury
trial. It does not guarantee that a particular number of jury
trials will actually take place. That more defendants elect to
waive that right (because, for example, government at the moment is
not particularly oppressive) does not prove that a constitutional
provision guaranteeing availability of that option is
disserved.

															Â Â Â Justice
Breyerâ€™s more general
argumentâ€”that Apprendi undermines
alternatives to adversarial factfindingâ€”is not
so much a criticism of Apprendi as an assault on jury
trial generally. His esteem for
â€œnon-adversarialâ€ truth-seeking
processes, post, at 12, supports just as well an argument
against either. Our Constitution and the common-law traditions it
entrenches, however, do not admit the contention that facts are
better discovered by judicial inquisition than by adversarial
testing before a jury. See 3 Blackstone, Commentaries, at
373â€“374, 379â€“381. Justice
Breyer may be convinced of the equity of the regime he favors, but
his views are not the ones we are bound to uphold.

															Â Â Â Ultimately, our decision
cannot turn on whether or to what degree trial by jury impairs the
efficiency or fairness of criminal justice. One can certainly argue
that both these values would be better served by leaving justice
entirely in the hands of professionals; many nations of the world,
particularly those following civil-law traditions, take just that
course. There is not one shred of doubt, however, about the
Framersâ€™ paradigm for criminal justice: not the
civil-law ideal of administrative perfection, but the common-law
ideal of limited state power accomplished by strict division of
authority between judge and jury. As Apprendi held, every
defendant has the right to insist that the prosecutor
prove to a jury all facts legally essential to the punishment.
Under the dissentersâ€™ alternative, he has no
such right. That should be the end of the matter.

Â Â Â Petitioner was sentenced to
prison for more than three years beyond what the law allowed for
the crime to which he confessed, on the basis of a disputed finding
that he had acted with â€œdeliberate
cruelty.â€ The Framers would not have thought it too
much to demand that, before depriving a man of three more years of
his liberty, the State should suffer the modest inconvenience of
submitting its accusation to â€œthe unanimous
suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours,â€ 4
Blackstone, Commentaries, at 343, rather than a lone employee of
the State.

															Â Â Â The judgment of the
Washington Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.
Footnote 1

															Â Parts of
Washingtonâ€™s criminal code have been recodified
and amended. We cite throughout the provisions in effect at the
time of sentencing.
Footnote 2

															Â Petitioner further agreed
to an additional charge of second-degree assault involving domestic
violence, Wash. Rev. Code Ann. Â§Â§9 A.
36.021(1)(c), 10.99.020(3)(b) (2000). The 14-month sentence on that
count ran concurrently and is not relevant here.
Footnote 3

															Â The domestic-violence
stipulation subjected petitioner to such measures as a
â€œno-contactâ€ order, see
Â§10.99.040, but did not increase the standard range of
his sentence.
Footnote 4

															Â The judge found other
aggravating factors, but the Court of Appeals questioned their
validity under state law and their independent sufficiency to
support the extent of the departure. See 111 Wash. App. 851,
868â€“870, and n.Â 3, 47
P.Â 3d 149, 158â€“159, and
n.Â 3 (2002). It affirmed the sentence solely on the
finding of domestic violence with deliberate cruelty.
Ibid. We therefore focus only on that factor.
Footnote 5

															Â Justice Breyer cites
Justice Oâ€™Connorâ€™s
Apprendi dissent for the point that this Bishop quotation
means only that indictments must charge facts that trigger
statutory aggravation of a common-law offense. Post, at 14
(dissenting opinion). Of course, as he notes, Justice
Oâ€™Connor was referring to an entirely different
quotation, from Archboldâ€™s treatise.
See 530 U. S., at 526 (citing J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in
Criminal Cases 51, 188 (15th ed. 1862)). Justice Breyer claims the
two are â€œsimilar,â€ post, at
14, but they are as similar as chalk and cheese. Bishop was not
â€œaddressingâ€ the
â€œproblemâ€ of statutes that aggravate
common-law offenses. Ibid. Rather, the entire chapter of
his treatise is devoted to the point that â€œevery
fact which is legally essential to the punishmentâ€ must
be charged in the indictment and proved to a jury. 1 J. Bishop,
Criminal Procedure, ch. 6, pp. 50â€“56 (2d ed.
1872). As one â€œexampleâ€ of this
principle (appearing several pages before the language we quote in
text above), he notes a statute aggravating common-law assault.
Id., Â§82, at 51â€“52. But
nowhere is there the slightest indication that his general
principle was limited to that example. Even Justice
Breyerâ€™s academic supporters do not make
that claim. See Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding and Sentence
Enhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L.Â J.
1097, 1131â€“1132 (2001) (conceding that
Bishopâ€™s treatise supports Apprendi,
while criticizing its â€œnatural-law
theorizingâ€).
Footnote 6

															Â As to Justice
Oâ€™Connorâ€™s criticism of the
quantity of historical support for the Apprendi rule,
post, at 10 (dissenting opinion): It bears repeating that
the issue between us is not whether the Constitution
limits Statesâ€™ authority to reclassify elements
as sentencing factors (we all agree that it does); it is only which
line, ours or hers, the Constitution draws. Criticism of the
quantity of evidence favoring our alternative would have some force
if it were accompanied by any evidence favoring hers.
Justice Oâ€™Connor does not even provide a
coherent alternative meaning for the jury-trial guarantee, unless
one considers â€œwhatever the legislature chooses
to leave to the jury, so long as it does not go too
farâ€ coherent. See infra, at
9â€“12.
Footnote 7

															Â The State does not
contend that the domestic-violence stipulation alone supports the
departure. That the statute lists domestic violence as grounds for
departure only when combined with some other aggravating factor
suggests it could not. See
Â§Â§9.94A.390(2)(h)(i)â€“(iii).
Footnote 8

															Â Nor does it matter that
the judge must, after finding aggravating facts, make a judgment
that they present a compelling ground for departure. He cannot make
that judgment without finding some facts to support it beyond the
bare elements of the offense. Whether the judicially determined
facts require a sentence enhancement or merely
allow it, the verdict alone does not authorize the
sentence.
Footnote 9

															Â The United States, as
amicus curiae, urges us to affirm. It notes differences
between Washingtonâ€™s sentencing regime and the
Federal Sentencing Guidelines but questions whether those
differences are constitutionally significant. See Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 25â€“30. The
Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on
them.
Footnote 10

															Â Justice
Oâ€™Connor believes that a
â€œbuilt-in political checkâ€ will
prevent lawmakers from manipulating offense elements in this
fashion. Post, at 10. But the many immediate practical
advantages of judicial factfinding, see post, at
5â€“7, suggest that political forces would, if
anything, pull in the opposite direction. In any case, the
Framersâ€™ decision to entrench the jury-trial
right in the Constitution shows that they did not trust government
to make political decisions in this area.
Footnote 11

															Â Another example of
conversion from separate crime to sentence enhancement that Justice
Oâ€™Connor evidently does not consider going
â€œtoo farâ€ is the
obstruction-of-justice enhancement, see post, at
6â€“7. Why perjury during trial should be grounds
for a judicial sentence enhancement on the underlying offense,
rather than an entirely separate offense to be found by a jury
beyond a reasonable doubt (as it has been for centuries, see 4 W.
Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England
136â€“138 (1769)), is unclear.
Footnote 12

															Â Justice Breyer responds
that States are not required to give defendants the option
of waiving jury trial on some elements but not others.
Post, at 8â€“9. True enough. But why
would the States that he asserts we are coercing into
hard-heartednessâ€”that is, States that
want judge-pronounced determinate sentencing to be the
norm but we wonâ€™t let
themâ€”want to prevent a defendant from
choosing that regime? Justice Breyer claims this
alternative may prove â€œtoo expensive and
unwieldy for States to provide,â€ post, at 9,
but there is no obvious reason why forcing defendants to choose
between contesting all elements of his hypothetical 17-element
robbery crime and contesting none of them is less expensive than
also giving them the third option of pleading guilty to some
elements and submitting the rest to judicial factfinding. Justice
Breyerâ€™s argument rests entirely on a
speculative prediction about the number of defendants likely to
choose the first (rather than the second) option if denied the
third.
Footnote 13

															Â To be sure, Justice
Breyer and the other dissenters would forbid those increases of
sentence that violate the constitutional principle that tail shall
not wag dog. The source of this principle is entirely unclear. Its
precise effect, if precise effect it has, is presumably to require
that the ratio of sentencing-factor add-on to basic criminal
sentence be no greater than the ratio of caudal vertebrae to body
in the breed of canine with the longest tail. Or perhaps no greater
than the average such ratio for all breeds. Or perhaps the median.
Regrettably, Apprendi has prevented full development of
this line of jurisprudence.
