SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 07-689

															GARY BARTLETT, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NORTH
CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, et al., PETITIONERS
v. DWIGHT STRICKLAND et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of north
carolina

															[March 9, 2009]

															   Justice Thomas, with whom Justice
Scalia joins, concurring in the judgment.

															   I continue to adhere to the views
expressed in my opinion in Holder v. Hall,
512 U. S. 874,
891 (1994) (opinion concurring in judgment). The text of §2 of
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 does not authorize any vote dilution
claim, regardless of the size of the minority population in a given
district. See 42 U. S. C. §1973(a) (2000 ed.) (permitting
only a challenge to a “voting qualification or prerequisite
to voting or standard, practice, or procedure”); see also
Holder, supra, at 893 (stating that the terms
“ ‘standard, practice, or
procedure’ ” “reach only state enactments
that limit citizens’ access to the ballot”). I continue
to disagree, therefore, with the framework set forth in
Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986), for
analyzing vote dilution claims because it has no basis in the text
of §2. I would not evaluate any Voting Rights Act claim under
a test that “has produced such a disastrous misadventure in
judicial policymaking.” Holder, supra, at
893. For these reasons, I concur only in the judgment.
