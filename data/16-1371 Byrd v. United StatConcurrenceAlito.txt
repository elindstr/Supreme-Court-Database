															TERRENCE BYRD, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit

															[May 14, 2018]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring.

															The Court holds that an unauthorized driver of a rental car is not always barred from contesting a search of the vehicle.  Relevant questions bearing on the driver’s ability to raise a
 
Fourth Amendment claim may include: the terms of the particular rental agreement, see ante, at 11–12; the circumstances surrounding the rental, ante, at 13; the reason why the driver took the wheel, ante, at 11–12; any property right that the driver might have, ante, at 7; and the legality of his conduct under the law of the State where the conduct occurred, ante, at 12–13.  On remand, the Court of Appeals is free to reexamine the question whether petitioner may assert a
 
Fourth Amendment claim or to decide the appeal on another appropriate ground.  Ante, at 14–15.  On this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court.
