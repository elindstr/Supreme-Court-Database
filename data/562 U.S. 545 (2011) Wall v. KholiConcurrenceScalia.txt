SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 09-868





															ASHBEL T. WALL, II, DIRECTOR, RHODE ISLAND
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, PETI-
TIONER v. KHALIL KHOLI

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the first circuit

															[March 7, 2011]



															   Justice Scalia, concurring in part.

															
   The Court holds that the term “collateral review” in 28 U. S. C. §2242(d)(2) means review that is not direct, ante, at 5, and that a motion under Rhode Island’s Rule 35 seeks collateral review, ante, at 9.  Because I agree with those conclusions, I cannot join footnote 3 of the Court’s opinion, ante, at 9, n. 3, which declines to decide whether a Rule 35 motion seeks direct review.
