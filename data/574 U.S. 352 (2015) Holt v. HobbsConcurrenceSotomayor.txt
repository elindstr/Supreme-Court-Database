															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															GREGORY HOUSTON HOLT, aka ABDUL MAALIK MUHAMMAD, PETITIONER
v. RAY HOBBS, DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION,
etÂ al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the eighth circuit

															[January 20, 2015]

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring.

															I concur in the Courtâ€™s opinion, which holds
that the Department failed to show why the less restrictive
al-ternatives identified by petitioner in the course of this
litigation were inadequate to achieve the
Departmentâ€™s compelling security-related
interests. I write separatelyto explain my understanding of the
applicable legalstandard.

															Nothing in the Courtâ€™s opinion calls into
question our prior holding in Cutter v. Wilkinson
that â€œ[c]ontext mattersâ€ in the
application of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons
Act of 2000 (RLUIPA),114Stat.803,42
U.Â S.Â C. Â§2000cc
etÂ seq. 544 U.Â S. 709,723 (2005)
(internal quotation marks omitted). In the dangerous prison
environment, â€œregulations and
proceduresâ€ are needed to â€œmaintain
good order, security and discipline, consistent with consideration
of costs and limited resources.â€ Ibid. Of
course, that is not to say that cost alone is an absolute defense
to an otherwise meritorious RLUIPA claim. See
Â§2000ccâ€“3(c). Thus, we recognized
â€œthat prison security is a compelling state
interest, and that deference is due to institutional
officialsâ€™ expertise in this
area.â€ Cutter, 544 U.Â S., at 725,
n.Â 13.

															I do not understand the Courtâ€™s opinion to
preclude deferring to prison officialsâ€™
reasoning when that deference is dueâ€”that is,
when prison officials offer a plausible explanation for their
chosen policy that is supported by whatever evidence is reasonably
available to them. But the deference that must be
â€œextend[ed to] the experience and expertise of
prison administrators does not extend so far that prison officials
may declare a compelling governmental interest by
fiat.â€ Yellowbear v. Lampert, 741
F.Â 3d 48, 59 (CA10 2014). Indeed, prison policies
â€œÂ â€˜grounded on
mere speculationâ€™Â â€
are exactly the ones that motivated Congress to enact
RLUIPA. 106 Cong. Rec. 16699 (2000) (quoting
S.Â Rep. No. 103â€“111, 10
(1993)).

															Here, the Departmentâ€™s failure to
demonstrate why the less restrictive policies petitioner identified
in the course of the litigation were insufficient to achieve its
compelling interestsâ€”not the
Courtâ€™s independent judgment concerning the
merit of these alternative approachesâ€”is
ultimately fatal to the Departmentâ€™s position.
The Court is appro-priately skeptical of the relationship between
the De-partmentâ€™s no-beard policy and its
alleged compelling interests because the Department offered little
more than unsupported assertions in defense of its refusal of
petitionerâ€™s requested religious accommodation.
RLUIPA requires more.

															One final point bears emphasis. RLUIPA requires institutions
refusing an accommodation to demonstrate that the policy it defends
â€œis the least restrictive means of furthering
[the alleged] compelling .Â .Â .
interest[s].â€
Â§2000ccâ€“1(a)(2); see also
Washington v. Klem, 497 F.Â 3d 272, 284
(CA3 2007) (â€œ[T]he phrase
â€˜least restrictive meansâ€™
is, by definition, a relative term. It necessarily implies a
comparison with other meansâ€); Couch v.
Jabe, 679 F.Â 3d 197, 203 (CA4 2012) (same). But
nothing in the Courtâ€™s opinion suggests that
prison officials must refute every conceivable option to satisfy
RLUIPAâ€™s least restrictive means requirement.
Nor does it intimate that officials must prove that they considered
less restrictive alternatives at a particular point in time.
Instead, the Court correctly notes that the Department inadequately
responded to the less restrictive policies that petitioner brought
to the Departmentâ€™s attention during the course
of the litigation, including the more permissive policies used by
the prisons in New York and California. See, e.g., United
States v. Wilgus, 638 F.Â 3d 1274, 1289 (CA10
2011) (observing in the analogous context of the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act of 1993 that the government need not
â€œdo the impossibleâ€”refute
each and every conceivable alternative regulation
schemeâ€ but need only â€œrefute the
alternative schemes offered by the challengerâ€).

															Because I understand the Courtâ€™s opinion to
be consistent with the foregoing, I join it.
