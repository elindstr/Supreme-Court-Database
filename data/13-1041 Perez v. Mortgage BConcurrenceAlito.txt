															[March 9, 2015]
															                    Justice Alito, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
															                    I join the opinion of the Court except for Part III–B.  I agree that the doctrine of Paralyzed Veterans of America v. D. C. Arena L. P., 117 F. 3d 579 (CADC 1997), is incompatible with the Administrative Procedure Act.  The creation of that doctrine may have been prompted by an understandable concern about the aggrandizement of the power of administrative agencies as a result of the combined effect of (1) the effective delegation to agencies by Congress of huge swaths of lawmaking authority, (2) the exploitation by agencies of the uncertain boundary between legislative and interpretive rules, and (3) this Court’s cases holding that courts must ordinarily defer to an agency’s interpretation of its own ambiguous regulations.  See Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co.,325 U. S. 410 (1945).  I do not dismiss these concerns, but the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine is not a viable cure for these problems.  At least one of the three factors noted above, however, concerns a matter that can be addressed by this Court.  The opinions of Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas offer substantial reasons why the Seminole Rock doctrine may be incorrect.  See also Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012) (slip op., at 13–14) (citing, inter alia, Manning, Constitutional Structure and Judicial Deference to Agency Interpretations of Agency Rules, 96 Colum. L. Rev. 612 (1996)).  I await a case in which the validity of Seminole Rock may be explored through full briefing and argument.
