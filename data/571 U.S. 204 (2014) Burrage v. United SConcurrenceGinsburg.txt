															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 12–7515

															_________________

															MARCUS ANDREW BURRAGE, PETITIONER v.UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[January 27, 2014]

															

															     Justice Ginsburg,
with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, concurring in the judgment.

															     For reasons explained
in my dissenting opinion in University of Tex. Southwestern Medical
Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S. ___, ___ (2013), I do not read
“because of” in the context of antidiscrimination laws
to mean “solely because of.” See id., at ___–___,
___–___ (slip op., at 20–21, 23–24). And I do not
agree that words “appear[ing] in two or more legal rules, and
so in connection with more than one purpose, ha[ve] and should have
precisely the same scope in all of them.” Cook,
“Substance” and “Procedure” in the Conflict
of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337 (1933). But I do agree that
“in the interpretation of a criminal statute subject to the
rule of lenity,” where there is room for debate, one should
not choose the construction “that disfavors the
defendant.” Ante, at 12. Accordingly, I join the
Court’s judgment.
