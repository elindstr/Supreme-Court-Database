															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															CTS CORPORATION, PETITIONER v. PETER
WALDBURGER et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 9, 2014]

															

															     Justice Scalia, with
whom The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito join,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															     I join all but Part
II–D of Justice Kennedy’s opinion. I do not join that
Part because I remain convinced that “[t]he proper rule of
construction for express pre-emption provisions is . . .
the one that is customary for statutory provisions in general:
Their language should be given its ordinary meaning.”
Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 548 (1992)
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in
part). The contrary notion—that express pre-emption
provisions must be construed narrowly—was
“extraordinary and unprecedented” when this Court
announced it two decades ago, id., at 544, and since then our
reliance on it has been sporadic at best, see Altria Group, Inc. v.
Good, 555 U. S. 70 –103 (2008) (Thomas, J., dissenting).
For the reasons given in the balance of the opinion, ordinary
principles of statutory construction demonstrate that 42
U. S. C. §9658 pre-empts only statutes of limitation
and not statutes of repose.
