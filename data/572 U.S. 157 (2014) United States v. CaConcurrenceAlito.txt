															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. JAMES ALVIN
CASTLEMAN

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[March 26, 2014]

															

															     Justice Alito, with
whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the judgment.

															     The decision in this
case turns on the meaning of the phrase “has, as an element,
the use . . . of physical force.” 18
U. S. C. §921(a)(33)(A)(ii). In Johnson v. United
States, 559 U. S. 133 (2010) , the Court interpreted the very same
language and held that “physical force” means
“violent force.” Id., at 140. I disagreed and concluded
that the phrase incorporated the well-established meaning of
“force” under the common law of battery, which did not
require violent force. See id., at 146 (dissenting opinion).

															     The Court of Appeals in
the present case understand-ably followed the reasoning of Johnson,
but now this Court holds that Johnson actually dictates that the
identical statutory language be interpreted in exactly the same way
that the Johnson majority rejected. See ante, at 5.

															     In my view, the meaning
of the contested statutory language is the same now as it was four
years ago in Johnson, and therefore, for the reasons set out in my
Johnson dissent, I would not extend the reasoning of Johnson to the
question presented here, on which the Johnson Court specifically
reserved judgment. 559 U. S., at 143–144.
