															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															james l. kisor, PETITIONER v. ROBERT WILKIE, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[June 26, 2019]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts, concurring in part.

															I join Parts I, II–B, III–B, and IV of the Court’s opinion.  We took this case to consider whether to overrule Auer v. Robbins,

519 U.S. 452 (1997), and Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co.,

325 U.S. 410 (1945).  For the reasons the Court discusses in Part III–B, I agree that overruling those precedents is not warranted.  I also agree with the Court’s treatment in Part II–B of the bounds of Auer deference.

															I write separately to suggest that the distance between the majority and Justice Gorsuch is not as great as it may initially appear.  The majority catalogs the prerequisites for, and limitations on, Auer deference: The underlying regulation must be genuinely ambiguous; the agency’s interpretation must be reasonable and must reflect its authoritative, expertise-based, and fair and considered judgment; and the agency must take account of reliance interests and avoid unfair surprise.  Justice Gorsuch, meanwhile, lists the reasons that a court might be persuaded to adopt an agency’s interpretation of its own regulation: The agency thoroughly considered the problem, offered a valid rationale, brought its expertise to bear, and interpreted the regulation in a manner consistent with earlier and later pronouncements.  Accounting for variations in verbal formulation, those lists have much in  common.

															That is not to say that Auer deference is just the same as the power of persuasion discussed in Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,

323 U.S. 134 (1944); there is a difference between holding that a court ought to be persuaded by an agency’s interpretation and holding that it should defer to that interpretation under certain conditions.  But it is to say that the cases in which Auer deference is warranted largely overlap with the cases in which it would be unreasonable for a court not to be persuaded by an agency’s interpre- tation of its own regulation.

															One further point: Issues surrounding judicial deference to agency interpretations of their own regulations are distinct from those raised in connection with judicial deference to agency interpretations of statutes enacted by Congress.  See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U.S. 837 (1984).  I do not re- gard the Court’s decision today to touch upon the latter question.
