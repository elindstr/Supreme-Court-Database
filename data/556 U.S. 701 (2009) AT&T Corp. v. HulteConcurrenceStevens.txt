															AT&T CORPORATION, PETITIONER v. NOREEN HULTEEN et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 18, 2009]



															   Justice Stevens, concurring.

															
   Today my appraisal of the Court’s decision in General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125 (1976), is the same as that expressed more than 30 years ago in my dissent.  I therefore agree with much of what Justice Ginsburg has to say in this case.  Nevertheless, I must accept Gilbert’s interpretation of Title VII as having been the governing law until Congress enacted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.  Because this case involves rules that were in force only prior to that Act, I join the Court’s opinion.
