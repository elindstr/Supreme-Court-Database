															CIC SERVICES, LLC, PETITIONER v. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[May 17, 2021]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring.

															I concur because I agree that CIC Services, a material advisor to taxpayers engaged in micro-captive transactions, does not bring this suit “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax,”

26 U. S. C. §7421(a), but rather for the purpose of avoiding the regulatory burdens imposed by Notice 2016–66 (Notice).  The three factors identified by the majority, taken in combination, show that this suit falls outside the ambit of the Anti-Injunction Act (AIA): The Notice imposes substantial compliance costs that are unconnected to (and possibly far greater than) CIC Services’ potential tax liability; the causal chain connecting the Notice’s reporting requirement to any tax is attenuated; and the Notice is enforced by criminal as well as tax penalties.  See ante, at 9–13.

															I write separately to highlight that the answer might be different if CIC Services were a taxpayer instead of a tax advisor.  Taxpayers who are subject to reporting requirements backed by tax penalties face a choice: (1) provide information about their own finances to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which may in turn use that information to calculate the taxpayers’ liability more accurately, or (2) refuse to provide such information and pay a noncompliance penalty, which Congress has deemed a tax.  For a given taxpayer, then, a tax on noncompliance may operate as a rough substitute for the tax liability she has evaded by withholding required information.  Moreover, compared with their tax advisors, taxpayers may incur less expense in collecting and reporting their own financial information.  Such information, after all, is about those taxpayers’ own activities and is likely to be in their possession.  Hence, while it will often be correct to conclude that a tax advisor challenging an IRS reporting requirement is not doing so “for the purpose of restraining” a tax on noncompliance, the analysis may be different when it comes to taxpayers.

															This case provides no occasion for the Court to inquire into the full quantity or variety of IRS reporting requirements that are backed by tax penalties, nor to predetermine whether the AIA would allow hypothetical taxpayers to challenge those requirements in court.  Whether such suits may proceed will depend on a context-specific inquiry into “the relief the suit requests” and the “aspects of the regulatory scheme” at issue.  Ante, at 7, 9.  On that understanding, I concur.
