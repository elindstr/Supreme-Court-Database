PETITIONERS v. BRANDON W. OWENS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the tenth circuit

															[December 15, 2014]

															Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.

															To remove a case from a state court to a federal court, a
defendant must file in the federal forum a notice of removal
â€œcontaining a short and plain statement of the
grounds for removal.â€28 U. S. C. Â§1446(a).
When re-moval is based on diversity of citizenship, an
amount-in-controversy requirement must be met. Ordinarily,
â€œthe matter in controversy [must] excee[d] the
sum or value of $75,000.â€ Â§1332(a). In
class actions for which the requirement of diversity of citizenship
is relaxed, Â§1332(d)(2)(A)â€“(C),
â€œthe matter in controversy [must] excee[d]the
sum or value of $5,000,000,â€ Â§1332(d)(2).
If theplaintiffâ€™s complaint, filed in state
court, demands mon-etary relief of a stated sum, that sum, if
asserted ingood faith, is â€œdeemed to be the
amount in controversy.â€ Â§1446(c)(2). When
the plaintiffâ€™s complaint does not state the
amount in controversy, the defendantâ€™s notice of
removal may do so. Â§1446(c)(2)(A).

															To assert the amount in controversy adequately in the removal
notice, does it suffice to allege the requisite amount plausibly,
or must the defendant incorporate into the notice of removal
evidence supporting the allegation? That is the single question
argued here and below by the parties and the issue on which we
granted review. The answer, we hold, is supplied by the removal
statute itself. A statement â€œshort and
plainâ€ need not contain evidentiary submissions.

															I

															Brandon W. Owens, plaintiff below and respondent here, filed a
putative class action in Kansas state court alleging that
defendants Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Company, LLC, and Cherokee
Basin Pipeline, LLC (collectively, Dart), underpaid royalties owed
to putative class members under certain oil and gas leases. The
complaint sought â€œa fair and reasonable
amountâ€ to compensate putative class members for
â€œdamagesâ€ they sustained due to the
alleged underpayments. App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a, 35a.

															Invoking federal jurisdiction under the Class Action Fairness
Act of 2005 (CAFA), Dart removed the case to the U.Â S.
District Court for the District of Kansas. CAFA gives federal
courts jurisdiction over certain class actions, defined in
Â§1332(d)(1), if the class has more than 100 members,
the parties are minimally diverse, and the amount in controversy
exceeds $5 million. Â§1332(d)(2), (5)(B); see
Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568
U.Â S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3).
Dartâ€™s notice of removal alleged that all three
requirements were satisfied. With respect to the amount in
controversy, Dart stated that the purported underpayments to
putative class members totaled more than $8.2 million.

															Owens moved to remand the case to state court. The notice of
removal was â€œdeficient as a matter of
law,â€Owens asserted, because it included
â€œno evidenceâ€ proving that the
amount in controversy exceeded $5 million. App. to Pet. for Cert.
46a, 53a. In response, Dart submitted a declaration by one of its
executive officers. The declaration included a detailed damages
calculation indicating that the amount in controversy, sans
interest, exceeded $11 million. Without challenging
Dartâ€™s calculation,Owens urged that
Dartâ€™s amount-in-controversy submissioncame too
late. â€œ[The] legally deficient [notice of
removal],â€ Owens maintained, could not be cured by
â€œpost-removal evidence about the amount in
controversy.â€ Id., at 100a.

															Reading Tenth Circuit precedent to require proof ofthe amount in
controversy in the notice of removal itself, the District Court
granted Owensâ€™ remand motion.
Dartâ€™sdeclaration, the District Court held,
could not serve to keep the case in federal court. The Tenth
Circuit, as the District Court read Circuit precedent,
â€œhas consistently held that reference to factual
allegations or evidence out-side of the petition and notice of
removal is not permitted to determine the amount in
controversy.â€ App. to Pet.for Cert. 26a, and n. 37
(citing Laughlin v. Kmart Corp., 50 F.Â 3d
871, 873 (1995); Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp.,
251 F.Â 3d 1284, 1291, n.Â 4 (2001);
Oklahoma Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. JSSJ Corp., 149
Fed. Appx. 775 (2005)).

															Ordinarily, remand orders â€œ[are] not
reviewable on appeal or otherwise.â€
Â§1447(d). There is an exception, however, for cases
invoking CAFA. Â§1453(c)(1). In such cases,
â€œa court of appeals may accept an appeal from an
order of a district court granting or denying a motion to
remand.â€ Ibid. Citing this exception, Dart
petitioned the Tenth Circuit for permission to appeal.
â€œUpon careful consideration of the
partiesâ€™ submissions, as well as the applicable
law,â€ the Tenth Circuit panel, dividing two-to-one,
denied review. App. to Pet. for Cert.
13aâ€“14a.

															An evenly divided court denied Dartâ€™s
petition for en banc review. Dissenting from the denial of
rehearing en banc, Judge Hartz observed that the Tenth Circuit
â€œ[had] let stand a district-court decision that
will in effect impose in this circuit requirements for notices of
removal that are even more onerous than the code pleading
requirements that .Â .Â . federal courts
abandoned long ago.â€ 730 F.Â 3d 1234 (2013).
The Tenth Circuit was duty-bound to grant Dartâ€™s
petition for rehearing en banc, Judge Hartz urged, because the
opportunity â€œto correct the law in our
circuitâ€ likely would not arise again. Id., at
1235. Henceforth, Judge Hartz explained, â€œany
diligent attorney .Â .Â . would submit to the
evidentiary burden rather than take a chance on remand to state
court.â€ Ibid.

															Dart filed a petition for certiorari in this Court requesting
resolution of the following question: â€œWhether a
defendant seeking removal to federal court is required to include
evidence supporting federal jurisdiction in the notice of removal,
or is alleging the required â€˜short and plain
statement of the grounds for removalâ€™
enough?â€ Pet. for Cert. i. Owensâ€™
brief in opposition raised no impediment to this
Courtâ€™s review. (Nor, later, did
Owensâ€™ merits brief suggest any barrier to our
consideration of Dartâ€™s petition.) We granted
certiorari to resolve a division among the Circuits on the question
presented. 572 U.Â S. ___ (2014). Compare
Ellenburg v. Spartan Motors Chassis, Inc., 519
F.Â 3d 192, 200 (CA4 2008) (a removing
partyâ€™s notice of removal need not
â€œmeet a higher pleading standard than the one
imposed on a plaintiff in drafting an initial
complaintâ€), and Spivey v. Vertrue, Inc.,
528 F.Â 3d 982, 986 (CA7 2008) (similar), with
Laughlin, 50 F.Â 3d, at 873
(â€œthe requisite amount in controversy
.Â .Â . must be affirmatively established on
the face of either the petition or the removal
noticeâ€).

															II

															As noted above, a defendant seeking to remove a case to a
federal court must file in the federal forum a notice of removal
â€œcontaining a short and plain statement of the
grounds for removal.â€ Â§1446(a). By design,
Â§1446(a) tracks the general pleading requirement stated
in Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See 14C C.
Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, & J. Steinman, Federal Practice
and Procedure Â§3733, pp. 639â€“641
(4th ed. 2009) (â€œSection 1446(a) requires only
that the grounds for removal be stated in â€˜a
short and plain
statementâ€™â€”terms borrowed
from the pleading requirement set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 8(a).â€). The legislative history of
Â§1446(a) is corroborative. Congress, by borrowing the
familiar â€œshort and plain statementâ€
standard from Rule 8(a), intended to â€œsimplify
the â€˜pleadingâ€™ requirements
for removalâ€ and to clarify that courts should
â€œapply the same liberal rules [to removal
allegations] that are applied to other matters of
pleading.â€ H.Â R. Rep. No.
100â€“889, p. 71 (1988). See also ibid.
(disapproving decisions requiring â€œdetailed
pleadingâ€).

															When a plaintiff invokes federal-court jurisdiction, the
plaintiffâ€™s amount-in-controversy allegation is
accepted if made in good faith. See, e.g., Mt. Healthy
City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,429 U.Â S. 274,276
(1977) (â€œÂ â€˜[T]he
sum claimed by the plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently
made in good faith.â€™Â â€)
(quoting St. Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab
Co.,303 U.Â S. 283,288 (1938); alteration in
original). Similarly, when a defendant seeks federal-court
adjudication, the defendantâ€™s
amount-in-controversy allegation should be accepted when not
contested by the plaintiff or questioned by the court. Indeed, the
Tenth Circuit, although not disturbing prior decisions demanding
proof together with the removal notice, recognized that it was
anomalous to treat commencing plaintiffs and removing defendants
differently with regard to the amount in controversy. See
McPhail v. Deere & Co., 529 F.Â 3d
947, 953 (2008) (requiring proof by defendant but not by plaintiff
â€œbears no evident logical relationship either to
the purpose of diversity jurisdiction, or to the principle that
those who seek to invoke federal jurisdiction must establish its
prerequisitesâ€).

															If the plaintiff contests the defendantâ€™s
allegation, Â§1446(c)(2)(B) instructs:
â€œ[R]emoval .Â .Â . is
proper on the basis of an amount in controversy
assertedâ€ by the defendant â€œif the
district court finds, by the preponderance of the evidence, that
the amount in controversy exceedsâ€ the jurisdictional
threshold.[1] This provision, added to
Â§1446 as part of the Federal Courts Jurisdiction and
Venue Clarification Act of 2011 (JVCA), clarifies the procedure in
order when a defendantâ€™s assertion of the amount
in controversy is challenged. In such a case, both sides submit
proof and the court decides, by a preponderance of the evidence,
whether the amount-in-controversy requirement has been satisfied.
As the House Judiciary Committee Report on the JVCA observed:

															â€œ[D]efendants do not need to prove to a legal
certainty that the amount in controversy requirement has been met.
Rather, defendants may simply allege or assert that the
jurisdictional threshold has been met. Discovery may be taken with
regard to that question. In case of a dispute, the district court
must make findings of jurisdictional fact to which the
preponderance standard applies.â€ H.Â R. Rep.
No. 112â€“10, p.Â 16 (2011).

															Of course, a dispute about a defendantâ€™s
jurisdictional allegations cannot arise until after the
defendant files a notice of removal containing those allegations.
Brief for Dart 14.

															In remanding the case to state court, the District Court relied,
in part, on a purported
â€œpresumptionâ€ against removal. App.
to Pet. for Cert. 28a. See, e.g., Laughlin, 50
F.Â 3d, at 873 (â€œ[T]here is a
presumption against removal jurisdiction.â€). We need
not here decide whether such a presumption is proper in mine-run
diversity cases. It suffices to point out that no antiremoval
presumption attends cases invoking CAFA, which Congress enacted to
facilitate adjudication of certain class actions in federal court.
See Standard Fire Ins. Co., 568 U.Â S., at ___
(slip op., at 6) (â€œCAFAâ€™s
primary objectiveâ€ is to â€œensur[e]
â€˜Federal court consideration of interstate cases
of national
importance.â€™Â â€ (quoting
Â§2(b)(2),119Stat.5)); S. Rep. No.
109â€“14, p. 43 (2005) (CAFAâ€™s
â€œprovisions should be read broadly, with a
strong preference that interstate class actions should be heard in
a federal court if properly removed by any
defendant.â€).

															In sum, as specified in Â§1446(a), a
defendantâ€™s notice of removal need include only
a plausible allegation that the amount in controversy exceeds the
jurisdictional threshold. Evidence establishing the amount is
required by Â§1446(c)(2)(B) only when the plaintiff
contests, or the court questions, the
defendantâ€™s allegation.

															III

															As in Standard Fire Ins. Co., 568 U.Â S., at
___â€“___ (slip op., at 2â€“3),
we granted review in this case after the Court of Appeals declined
to hear an appeal from a remand order. Neither party in that case
or in this one questioned our review authority under28
U.Â S.Â C. Â§1254(1)
(â€œCases in the courts of appeals may be reviewed
.Â .Â . [b]y writ of certiorari upon the
petition of any party .Â .Â . before or after
rendition of judgment.â€).[2] An
amicus brief filed in support of Owens by Public Citizen,
Inc., however, raised a jurisdictional impediment.

															Section 1453(c)(1), Public Citizen noted, provides that
â€œa court of appeals may accept an appeal
from an order ofa district court granting or denying a motion to
remand a class action to the State court from which it was
removed[.]â€ (Emphasis added.) Because court of appeals
review of a remand order is discretionary, see supra, at 3,
and the Tenth Circuit exercised its discretion to deny review,
Public Citizen urged, â€œ[b]oth parties ask this
Court to decide an issue that is not properly before
it.â€ Brief for Public Citizen 6.
â€œAbsent grounds for reversing the court of
appealsâ€™ decision to deny permission to
appeal,â€ Public Citizen asserted,
â€œthe merits of the district
courtâ€™s decision are not before any appellate
court, including this one.â€ Ibid.

															Satisfied that there are indeed â€œgrounds for
reversing the [Tenth Circuitâ€™s] decision to deny
permission to appeal,â€ we find no jurisdictional
barrier to our settlement of the question presented. The case was
â€œinâ€ the Court of Appeals because of
Dartâ€™s leave-to-appeal application, and we have
jurisdiction to review what the Court of Appeals did with that
application. See28 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§1254; Hohn v. United States,524
U.Â S. 236,248 (1998). Owens, we reiterate, did not
contest the scope of our review.

															Discretion to review a remand order is not rudderless. See
Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System,
Inc., 572 U.Â S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4)
(â€œmatters of discretion are reviewable for abuse
of discretionâ€ (internal quotation marks omitted)). A
court â€œwould necessarily abuse its discretion if
it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law.â€
Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.,496
U.Â S. 384,405 (1990). This case fits that
bill.[3]

															There are many signals that the Tenth Circuit relied on the
legally erroneous premise that the District
Courtâ€™s decision was correct. In an earlier
case, the Tenth Circuit, following the First
Circuitâ€™s lead, stated considerations that it
regards as relevant to the intelligent exercise of discretion under
Â§1453(c)(1). BP America, Inc. v. Okla-homa
exÂ rel. Edmondson, 613 F.Â 3d 1029,
1034â€“1035 (2010)(adopting factors set out in
College of Dental Surgeons of Puerto Rico v. Connecticut
Gen. Life Ins. Co., 585 F.Â 3d 33,
38â€“39 (CA1 2009)).[4] When the
CAFA-related question presented in an appeal from a remand order is
â€œimportant, unsettled, and
recurrent,â€ the First Circuit instructed, a court of
appeals should inquire: â€œAbsent an interlocutory
appeal, [will the question] in all probability escape meaningful
appellate review.â€ Id., at 39. Or, as phrased by
the Tenth Circuit, if a district courtâ€™s remand
order remains undisturbed, will the case â€œleave
the ambit of the federal courts for good, precluding any other
opportunity for [the defendant] to vindicate its claimed legal
entitlement [under CAFA] .Â .Â . to have a
federal tribunal adjudicate the merits.â€ BP
America, 613 F.Â 3d, at 1035. See also Coffey
v. Freeport McMoran Copper & Gold, 581 F.Â 3d
1240, 1247 (CA10 2009) (noting that â€œthe purpose
of Â§1453(c)(1) isto develop a body of appellate law
interpreting CAFAâ€(brackets and internal quotation
marks omitted)). Thus, the Tenth Circuitâ€™s own
guide weighed heavily in favor of accepting
Dartâ€™s appeal. That the Court of Appeals,
instead, rejected Dartâ€™s appeal strongly
suggests that the panel thought the District Court got it right in
requiring proof of the amount in controversy in the removal
notice.

															In practical effect, the Court of Appealsâ€™
denial of review established the law not simply for this case, but
for future CAFA removals sought by defendants in the Tenth Circuit.
The likelihood is slim that a later case will arise in which the
Tenth Circuit will face a plea to retract the rule that both Owens
and the District Court ascribed to decisions of the Court of
Appeals: Defendants seeking to remove under CAFA must be sent back
to state court unless they submit with the notice of removal
evidence proving the alleged amount in controversy. See
supra, at 3. On this point, Judge Hartzâ€™s
observation, dissenting from the Tenth Circuitâ€™s
denial of rehearing en banc, see supra, at 4, bears
recounting in full:

															â€œAfter todayâ€™s decision
any diligent attorney (and one can assume that an attorney
representing a defendant in a case involving at least $5
millionâ€”the threshold for removal under
CAFAâ€”would have substantial incentive to be
diligent) would submit to the evidentiary burden rather than take a
chance on remand to state court.â€ 730
F.Â 3d, at 1235.

															With no responsible attorney likely to renew the fray, Judge
Hartz anticipated, â€œthe issue will not arise
again.â€ Ibid. Consequently, the law applied by
the District Courtâ€”demanding that the notice of
removal contain evidence documenting the amount in
controversyâ€”will be frozen in place for all
venues within the Tenth Circuit.[5]

															Recall that the Court of Appeals denied
Dartâ€™s petition for review
â€œ[u]pon careful consideration of the
partiesâ€™ submissions, as well as the applicable
law.â€ App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a. What did the parties
submit to the Tenth Circuit? Their presentations urged conflicting
views on whether a removing defendant must tender prima facie proof
of the amount in controversy as part of the removal notice. And
what was â€œthe applicable lawâ€ other
than the rule recited by the Tenth Circuit in Laughlin and
follow-on decisions, i.e., to remove successfully, a
defendant must present with the notice of removal evidence proving
the amount in controversy.[6]

															From all signals one can discern then, the Tenth
Circuitâ€™s denial of Dartâ€™s
request for review of the remand order was infected by legal error.
The District Court erred in ruling that Dartâ€™s
amount-in-controversy allegation failed for want of proof, but that
error was driven by the District Courtâ€™s
conscientious endeavor to follow Circuit precedent. The parties
trained their arguments in the Tenth Circuit, as they did here, on
the question whether Dart could successfully remove without
detailing in the removal notice evidence of the amount in
controversy. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47 (acknowledgment by
Owensâ€™ counsel that â€œthe
issues .Â .Â . provided to
.Â .Â . the Tenth Circuit were very similar
to what you see in this Court, with the exception of [the question
raised by Public Citizen] whether this Court has
jurisdictionâ€). Dissenting from the denial of rehearing
en banc, Judge Hartz explained at length why the Tenth Circuit
â€œowe[d] a duty to the bench and barâ€
to correct the District Courtâ€™s misperception
and to state as the Circuitâ€™s law:
â€œ[A] defendant seeking removal under CAFA need
only allege the jurisdictional amount in its notice of removal and
must prove that amount only if the plaintiff challenges the
allegation.â€ 730 F.Â 3d, at 1234, 1238. In
this regard, we note, the Tenth Circuit has cautioned against
casual rulings on applications like Dartâ€™s.
â€œThe decision whether to grant leave to
appealâ€ under Â§1453(c), the Tenth Circuit
stressed, calls for the exercise of the reviewing
courtâ€™s correctly
â€œinformed discretion.â€ BP
America, 613 F.Â 3d, at 1035 (emphasis added); see
supra, at 8â€“9.

															Recall, moreover, that Owens never suggested in his written
submissions to this Court that anything other than the question
presented accounts for the Court of Appealsâ€™
disposition. If Owens believed that the Tenth
Circuitâ€™s denial of leave to appeal rested on
some other ground, he might have said so in his brief in opposition
or, at least, in his merits brief. See this
Courtâ€™s Rule 15.2; Granite Rock Co. v.
Teamsters,561 U.Â S. 287,306 (2010). He said
nothing of that order, for he, like Dart, antici-pated that the
question presented was ripe for this Courtâ€™s
resolution.

															In the above-described circumstances, we find it an abuse of
discretion for the Tenth Circuit to deny Dartâ€™s
request for review. Doing so froze the governing rule in the
Circuit for this case and future CAFA removal notices, with no
opportunity for defendants in Dartâ€™s position
responsibly to resist making the evidentiary submission. That
situation would be bizarre for a decisionmaker who did not think
that the amount in controversy in diversity cases is a matter a
removal notice must demonstrate by evidence, not merely credibly
allege.[7] And if the Circuit precedent on which
the District Court relied misstated the law, as we hold it did,
then the District Courtâ€™s order remanding this
case to the state court is fatally infected by legal error.

															Careful inspection thus reveals that the two issues Public
Citizen invites us to separateâ€”whether the Tenth
Circuit abused its discretion in denying review, and whether the
District Courtâ€™s remand order was
erroneousâ€”do not pose genuinely discrete
questions. Instead, resolution of both issues depends on the answer
to the very same question: What must the removal notice contain? If
the notice need not contain evidence, the Tenth Circuit abused its
discretion in effectively making the opposing view the law of the
Circuit. By the same token, the District Court erred in remanding
the case for want of an evidentiary submission in the removal
notice. We no doubt have authority to review for abuse of
discretion the Tenth Circuitâ€™s denial of
Dartâ€™s appeal from the District
Courtâ€™s remand order, see supra, at 8,
and in doing so, to correct the erroneous view of the law the Tenth
Circuitâ€™s decision fastened on district courts
within the Circuitâ€™s domain.[8]

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															For the reasons stated, the judgment of the U.Â S.
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is vacated, and the case is
remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1Â Section 1446(c)(2) applies to
removals â€œsought on the basis of the
jurisdiction conferred by section 1332(a),â€ and
Â§1446(c)(2)(B) provides that
â€œremoval of the action is proper
.Â .Â . [if] the amount in controversy
exceeds the [in excess of $75,000] amount specified in section
1332(a)â€ (emphasis added). We assume, without
deciding, a point the parties do not dispute: Sections 1446(c)(2)
and 1446(c)(2)(B) apply to cases removed under
Â§1332(d)(2), and removal is proper if the amount in
controversy exceeds $5 million, the amount specified in
Â§1332(d)(2). See Frederick v. Hartford
Underwriters Ins. Co., 683 F.Â 3d 1242, 1247 (CA10
2012) (â€œ[T]here is no logical reason why we
should demand more from a CAFA defendant than other parties
invoking federal jurisdiction.â€ (internal quotation
marks omitted)).
2Â Todayâ€™s
dissenters joined the opinion in Standard Fire Ins. Co. v.
Knowles, 568 U.Â S. ___ (2013), without
suggesting any lack of jurisdiction to reach the
merits.
3Â Justice
Scaliaâ€™s dissent (hereafter dissent) faults Dart
for asserting, late in the day, that the Tenth Circuit abused its
discretion, observing that Dart did so only in its reply brief.
Post, at 6. But Public Citizen teed up that issue
after the parties filed their merits briefs. In view of this
Courtâ€™s decision in Standard Fire Ins.
Co., 568 U.Â S. ___, see supra, at
7â€“8, the parties had no cause to address the
matter earlier.
4Â Neither court stated the
listed considerations as an inflexible test. We have no occasion in
this case to review each of the factors identified by the First and
Tenth Circuits.
5Â The dissent suggests that the
Tenth Circuit may have another opportunity to set Circuit precedent
straight: A lawyer may be irresponsible or fail to learn from
Dartâ€™s experience; or perhaps a lawyer will put
in evidence the district court deems insufficient, and then have a
go at arguing that the evidence was sufficient and, in any event,
â€œno evidence is required at all.â€
Post, at 5â€“6. That such a case will
occur, and that the Tenth Circuit would then seize the very
opportunity it passed up in Dartâ€™s case, is
hardly probable.
6Â The dissent posits that
â€œthe applicable lawâ€ might have been
something other than the law governing the
partiesâ€™ submissions. Post, at 3, 4. That
is a strained reading of the Tenth Circuitâ€™s
expression. Perhaps the Tenth Circuit found this case a
â€œpoor vehicle,â€ the dissent
suggests, post, at 2, but no potential vehicle concerns were
urged by Owens, and the dissent identifies none. Or the Tenth
Circuit might have doubted its â€œability to
quickly resolve the issueâ€ within the 60-day time limit
provided in Â§1453(c)(2)â€“(3).
Ibid.; see also post, at 4. Section
1453(c)â€™s timing provision, however, was
designed to promote expedition, not to discourage Courts of Appeals
from acting on petitions for appeal. As a third
â€œmaybe,â€ the dissent observes that
proof of the amount in controversy in removal notices is not
â€œa question unique to [CAFA].â€
Post, at 3. True, the Tenth Circuit demands such proof in
ordinary diversity cases. See Laughlin v. Kmart
Corp., 50 F.Â 3d 871, 873 (1995). But that does not
make the imposition one whit less in CAFA cases.
7Â Caution is in order when
attributing a basis to an unreasoned decision. But we have not
insisted upon absolute certainty when that basis is fairly inferred
from the record. See Taylor v. McKeithen,407
U.Â S. 191, n.Â 2 (1972) (per curiam)
(rejecting â€œpossible, but unlikelyâ€
basis for unreasoned decision); Nixon v.
Fitzgerald,457 U.Â S. 731â€“743
(1982) (facing an unreasoned Court of Appeals decision, we
projected what the Court of Appeals â€œappears to
haveâ€ reasoned); Tr. of OralArg.
18â€“19 (observing that an appellate court often
assumes that a first instance court based its unexplained
discretionary decision on the ground the prevailing party
presented).
8Â Our disposition does not
preclude the Tenth Circuit from asserting and explaining on remand
that a permissible ground underlies its decision to decline
