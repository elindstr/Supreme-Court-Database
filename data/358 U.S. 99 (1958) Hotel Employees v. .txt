CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT
Syllabus 

															Dismissal by the National Labor Relations Board of petitioners' representation petition, on the sole ground of the Board's long established policy of not asserting jurisdiction over the hotel industry as a class, was beyond the Board's power.

															101 U.S.App.D.C. 414, 249 F.2d 506, reversed, and case remanded.

															PER CURIAM.

															We believe that dismissal of the representation petition on the sole ground of the Board's "longstanding policy not to exercise jurisdiction over the hotel industry" as a class, is contrary to the principles expressed in Office Employes v. Labor Board, 353 U. S. 313,  353 U. S. 318-320 (1957).  The judgment is therefore reversed, and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals for proceedings not inconsistent herewith.
