															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
															_________________
															No. 126, Orig.

															STATE OF KANSAS, PLAINTIFF v. STATES OF NEBRASKA AND COLORADO
															on exceptions to report of special master
															[February 24, 2015]
															                    Chief Justice Roberts, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
															                    I join Parts I and III of the Court’s opinion.  I am in general agreement with the discussion in Part II, but I do not believe our equitable power, though sufficient to order a remedy of partial disgorgement, permits us to alter the Accounting Procedures to which the States agreed.  I therefore join Part III of Justice Thomas’s opinion.
