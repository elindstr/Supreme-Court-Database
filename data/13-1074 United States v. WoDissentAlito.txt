															[April 22, 2015]
															Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.
															                    Our task in these cases is to interpret and enforce a federal statute that specifies the limits of the waiver of sovereign immunity in the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).  The FTCA waives the immunity of the United States for certain tort claims but provides that any “tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless” it is filed with the appropriate agency “withintwo years after such claim accrues” and in federal court “within six months after” the agency’s final decision.28 U. S. C. §2401(b).  The statutory text, its historical roots, and more than a century of precedents show that this absolute bar is not subject to equitable tolling.  I would enforce the statute as Congress intended and reverse.
															I
															                    The FTCA is a waiver of sovereign immunity and must be understood in that context.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Congress was reluctant to allow individual tort claims against the United States.  Instead, it granted relief to individuals through private laws enacted solely for those individuals’ benefit.  These waivers of sovereign immunity were surgical and sporadic, but “notoriously clumsy,” and by 1946 Congress thought it better to adopt a “simplified” approach.  Dalehite v. United States,346 U. S. 15–25 (1953).  The FTCA thus waived sovereign immunity for tort claims against the Government and set out a procedure for adjudicating those claims.
															                    This waiver of sovereign immunity was no trivial matter.  Long before the FTCA, Congress authorized suits against the Government for contract and property claims under the Tucker Act and a number of predecessor statutes, but the Tucker Act excluded tort claims from its waiver of sovereign immunity.  The concern was obvious: As opposed to the more predictable nature of contractual and property claims, tort-based harms are sometimes unperceived and open-ended.  Even frivolous claims require the Federal Government to expend administrative and litigation costs, which ultimately fall upon society at-large.  For every dollar spent to defend against or to sat-isfy a tort claim against the United States, the Government must either raise taxes or shift funds originally allocated to different public programs.
															                    To reduce these risks, Congress placed strict limits on the FTCA’s waiver of sovereign immunity.  The statute “exempts from [its] waiver certain categories of claims,” Ali v. Federal Bureau of Prisons,552 U. S. 214,218 (2008), and includes a broad exemption for claims “arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.”28 U. S. C. §2680(h); see also §§2680(a)–(n).  In addition, in order to limit the scope and unpredictability of the Government’s potential liability, the Act exempts from the waiver of sovereign immunity certain types of recovery, such as prejudgment interest and punitive damages.  See §2674.
															                    Most relevant here, the FTCA “condition[s]” its waiver of sovereign immunity on strict filing deadlines.  United States v. Kubrick,444 U. S. 111,117 (1979).  As enacted in 1946, the Act granted district courts exclusive jurisdiction over tort claims against the Government, “[s]ubject to the [other] provisions of” the Act.  FTCA, ch. 753, §410(a),60Stat.843–844.  One of those provisions stated that “[e]very claim against the United States cognizable under this title shall be forever barred, unless within one year after such claim accrued . . . it is presented in writing to the [relevant] Federal agency . . . or . . . an action is begun” in federal court.  §420, id., at 845.  The current version provides in full as follows:
															                    “A tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun within six months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.”28 U. S. C. §2401(b).
															II
															                    The question presented in these two cases is whether the FTCA’s filing deadlines are subject to equitable tolling.  We must therefore decide (1) whether the deadlines are “jurisdictional” in nature, so that courts are without power to adjudicate claims filed outside their strict limits and (2) if they are not jurisdictional, whether the statute nonetheless prohibits equitable tolling.  Both of these inquiries require close attention to the text, context, and history of the Act.  And both lead to the conclusion that the FTCA allows no equitable tolling.
															A
															                    The FTCA’s filing deadlines are jurisdictional.  The statute’s plain text prohibits adjudication of untimely claims.  Once the Act’s filing deadlines have run, all untimely claims “shall be forever barred.”  Ibid.  These words are not qualified or aspirational.  They are absolute.  If not filed with the agency within two years, or with a federal court within six months, a claim “shall be” “barred” “for-ever.”  “Shall be forever barred” is not generally understood to mean “should be allowed sometimes.”  The statute brooks no exceptions.  And because the filing deadlines restrict the FTCA’s waiver of sovereign immunity, they impose a limit on the courts’ jurisdiction that “we should not take it upon ourselves to extend.”  Kubrick, supra, at 117–118.
															                    For over 130 years, we have understood these terms as jurisdictional.  When crafting the FTCA’s limitations provision, Congress did not write on a clean slate.  Rather, it borrowed language from limitations provisions in the Tucker Act and its predecessor statutes.  The 1911 version of the Tucker Act included language that was nearly identical to that in the 1946 version of the FTCA: “Every claim against the United States cognizable by the Court of Claims, shall be forever barred unless the petition setting forth a statement thereof is filed in the court . . . within six years after the claim first accrues.”  §156,36Stat.1139.  That statutory language came, in turn, from the 1863 predecessor to the Tucker Act.  See §10,12Stat.767.
															                    As early as 1883, we interpreted these precise terms to impose a “jurisdiction[al]” requirement that the “court may not disregard.”  Kendall v. United States,107 U. S. 123.  We emphasized that, when waiving sovereign immunity, Congress “may restrict the jurisdiction of the [courts] to certain classes of demands.”  Ibid.  And we held that “[t]he express words of the statute leave no room for contention.”  Ibid.  The Court thus had no “authority to engraft” an equitable tolling provision where Congress had so clearly constrained the judiciary’s authority.  Ibid.
															                    Over the ensuing decades, we repeatedly reaffirmed our interpretation of the phrase.  In Finn v. United States,123 U. S. 227,232 (1887), we held that the Government could not waive the jurisdictional time bar and thus that the “duty of the court” was “to dismiss the petition” when a plaintiff raised an untimely claim.  We reached the same conclusion in De Arnaud v. United States,151 U. S. 483–496 (1894).  We reaffirmed the rule in United States v. New York,160 U. S. 598–619 (1896), while holding that there was jurisdiction where the plaintiff presented its claim before the statutory deadline.  And in Munro v. United States,303 U. S. 36, n. 1, 41 (1938), we held that a District Court lacked jurisdiction to resolve un-timely claims, even if the Government waived any objection, under a different statute that incorporated the Tucker Act’s time limits.  All the while, the lower courts similarly enforced the deadline as “a jurisdictional requirement, compliance with which is necessary to enable suit to be maintained against the sovereign.”  Compagnie Generale Transatlantique v. United States, 51 F. 2d 1053, 1056 (CA2 1931).  Thus, by 1946, the phrase “shall be forever barred” was well understood to deprive federal courts of jurisdiction over untimely claims.[1]
															                    The FTCA’s statutory terms must be understood in this context.  When Congress crafted the FTCA as a tort-based analogue to the Tucker Act, it consciously borrowed the well-known wording of the Tucker Act’s filing deadline.  Then, as now, it was settled that “[i]n adopting the language used in an earlier act, Congress must be considered to have adopted also the construction given by this Court to such language, and made it a part of the enactment.”  Hecht v. Malley,265 U. S. 144,153 (1924); see also Shapiro v. United States,335 U. S. 1,16 (1948); Sekhar v. United States, 570 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2013) (slip op., at 3–4) (“ ‘[I]f a word is obviously transplanted from another legal source, whether the common law or other legislation, it brings the old soil with it’ ” (quoting Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947))).
															                    Indeed, Congress considered departing from the Tucker Act’s prohibition on equitable tolling, but decided against it.  Proposals to include an equitable tolling provision were “included in nine of the thirty-one bills prior to the enactment of the FTCA,” but “the Act passed by the 1946 Congress did not provide for any equitable tolling of the limitations periods.”  Colella & Bain, Revisiting Equitable Tolling and the Federal Tort Claims Act, 31 Seton Hall L. Rev. 174, 195–196 (2000).  Instead, it was understood that individuals with claims outside those deadlines could turn to Congress for relief through private bills, as they did before the FTCA’s enactment.  See id., at 195.[2]
															                    The evidence of statutory meaning does not end there.  We reaffirmed the phase’s jurisdictional nature in the decades following the FTCA’s enactment.  In Soriano v. United States,352 U. S. 270 (1957), we rejected a request to allow equitable tolling under the Tucker Act.  Confirming the connection between the Tucker Act and the FTCA, we noted that “statutes permitting suits for tax refunds, tort actions, alien property litigation, patent cases, and other claims against the Government would be affected” if the Court allowed equitable tolling under the Tucker Act.  Id., at 275 (emphasis added).  And in Kubrick, 444 U. S., at 117–118, we cited Soriano’s warning while emphasizing that the FTCA’s time limits are a condition of the Act’s waiver of sovereign immunity.
															                    The lower courts also quickly recognized the statutes’ common heritage and enforced §2401(b) as a jurisdictional requirement.  In Anderegg v. United States, 171 F. 2d 127, 128 (1948) (per curiam), the Fourth Circuit cited Finn and Munro while holding that the FTCA’s filing deadline is a jurisdictional limit that the Government cannot waive.  The Fifth Circuit, in Simon v. United States, 244 F. 2d 703, 705, n. 4 (1957), held that the FTCA’s deadline is a jurisdictional condition on the Act’s waiver of sovereign immunity and cited Carpenter v. United States, 56 F. 2d 828, 829 (CA2 1932), a Tucker Act case, to support its holding.  And in Humphreys v. United States, 272 F. 2d 411 (1959), the Ninth Circuit similarly relied on Tucker Act precedents to hold that “the District Court has no jurisdiction over [an untimely FTCA] action,” because no waiver of sovereign immunity exists once the filing deadline “has run.”  Id., at 412 (citing Edwards v. United States, 163 F. 2d 268, 269 (CA9 1947), in turn citing Finn and Munro).  When Congress amended the FTCA in 1966, it readopted the “forever barred” language against the backdrop of Soriano and the lower courts’ interpretation of the phrase.  We must therefore assume that Congress meant to keep the universally recognized meaning of those words.  See, e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline,540 U. S. 581–594 (2004).
															                    That meaning, of course, cannot change over time.  But even if there were any doubt, we recently reaffirmed our view in John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,552 U. S. 130 (2008).  We explained that, unlike run-of-the-mill statutes of limitation, jurisdictional time limits “seek . . . to achieve a broader system-related goal, such as facilitating the administration of claims, limiting the scope of a governmental waiver of sovereign immunity, or promoting judicial efficiency.”  Id., at 133 (citations omitted).  Recounting our decisions in Kendall, Finn, De Arnaud, New York, and Soriano, we “reiterated” our understanding of the “absolute nature of the court of claims limitations statute.”  552 U. S., at 135.  And we rejected an invitation to abandon that interpretation, noting that Congress has long accepted our interpretation of the statute.  Id., at 139.
															                    The same must be said of the FTCA.  As we have often explained, “[w]hen a long line of this Court’s decisions left undisturbed by Congress has treated a similar requirement as ‘jurisdictional,’ we will presume that Congress intended to follow that course.”  Henderson v. Shinseki,562 U. S. 428,436 (2011) (citation and some internal quotation marks omitted); Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,559 U. S. 154,168 (2010); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers,558 U. S. 67,82 (2009).  Every single decision from this Court interpreting the Tucker Act’s “similar requirement” has treated it as jurisdictional.  And there is strong historical evidence that Congress “intended to follow that course.”  That should be the end of the matter: Section 2410(b)’s filing deadlines are jurisdictional limits that are not subject to equitable tolling.
															B
															                    Even if the FTCA’s filing deadlines are not jurisdic-tional, they still prohibit equitable tolling.  To be sure, in recent years, we have grown reluctant to affix the “jurisdictional” label.  See, e.g., Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp.,546 U. S. 500,510 (2006); Henderson, supra, at 434–436.  “But calling a rule nonjurisdictional does not mean that it is not mandatory.”  Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 10).  Where Congress imposes an inflexible claims processing rule, it is our duty to enforce the law and prohibit equitable tolling, whether it is jurisdictional or not.
															                    Here, Congress’ intent is clear.  The words of the statute leave no doubt that untimely claims are never allowed: They are “forever barred.”  This is no weak-kneed command.  The history underlying the text only bolsters its apparent meaning, and our repeated reaffirmation of the phrase’s meaning should remove any doubt.  Congress never meant for equitable tolling to be available under the FTCA.
															                    The only factor pointing in the opposite direction is our suggestion in Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,498 U. S. 89–96 (1990), that we would thenceforth apply a rebuttable presumption in favor of equitable tolling in suits against the Government.  But it is beyond me how Irwin’s judge-made presumption announced in 1990 can trump the obvious meaning of a statute enacted many decades earlier.  Cf. Cannon v. University of Chicago,441 U. S. 677,718 (1979) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).  In any event, Irwin’s rebuttable presumption is overcome in this case.  For well over a century, we have recognized the inflexible nature of the Tucker Act’s provision.  Since its adoption, we have recognized that the FTCA’s language bears the same meaning as its Tucker Act companion.  See Soriano, supra, at 275; Kubrick, supra, at 118.  And in John R. Sand & Gravel, we held that our “definitive ear-lier interpretation of the” Tucker Act is a “sufficient rebuttal” to Irwin’s presumption.  552 U. S., at 138.  There is no principled way to distinguish this case.  Section 2401(b) allows no equitable tolling.
															III
															                    The Court’s contrary conclusion is wrong at every step.  In its view, §2401(b)’s statutory text is “mundane” language that “ ‘reads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations.’ ”  Ante, at 8.  But “ordinary” nonjurisdictional time limits are typically directed at claimants.  The deadline in Henderson, for example, required that “a person adversely affected by [a Board of Veterans’ Appeals] decision shall file a notice of appeal . . . within 120 days after” the decision.38 U. S. C. §7266(a) (emphasis added); 562 U. S, at 438.  The “run-of-the-mill” limitations provision in Holland v. Florida,560 U. S. 631,647 (2010), likewise applied to the “person” responsible for filing: “A1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.”28 U. S. C. §2244(d)(1) (emphasis added); 560 U. S., at 635.  And the provision at issue in Irwin was similar, if not an even weaker command.  It provided that “ ‘[w]ithin thirty days of receipt of notice of final action taken by . . . the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . . . an employee or applicant for employment . . . may file a civil action.’ ”  498 U. S., at 94 (quoting42 U. S. C. §2000e–16(c) (1998 ed.); emphasis added).
															                    Section 2401(b), by contrast, never mentions the claimant, and it is phrased in emphatically absolute terms.  It says unequivocally that untimely tort claims against the United States “shall be forever barred.”  Although it does not use the word “jurisdiction,” it speaks at least as much to the courts (who are “forever barred” from considering untimely claims) as it does to claimants (who are “forever barred” from bringing stale claims).  More important, though, the words in §2401(b) have a well-known meaning that ipse dixit labels cannot overcome.[3]
															                    The majority tells us this “old ‘ad hoc,’ law-by-law approach”—also known as statutory interpretation—has been replaced with a broad presumption in favor of equitable tolling and a judicial preference against jurisdictional labels.  Ante, at 4.  I dispute the premise.  But in any event, as I explained above, and as six Members of the current Court held in John R. Sand & Gravel, the overwhelming evidence of congressional intent here easily overtakes Irwin’s rebuttable presumption.  Even if we would rather not call §2401(b)’s deadlines “jurisdictional,” with all that label entails, we must nonetheless recognize that Congress never meant to allow equitable tolling.
															                    The majority avoids this latter point by declining to give it any separate attention.  See ante, at 5, n. 2.  But we cannot conflate the two questions because, though the relevant evidence is the same, the analysis is different.  In particular, the majority is wrong to rely on Irwin when assessing the jurisdictional question, which is the only question it really decides.  We do not indulge Irwin’s presumption when determining whether a requirement is jurisdictional.  Instead, we typically invoke Irwin only after finding that a requirement is not jurisdictional, to decide whether Congress nonetheless intended to prohibit equitable tolling.  In Henderson, for instance, we never mentioned Irwin because the parties did not ask us to address whether the rule was “subject to equitable tolling if it [was] not jurisdictional.”  562 U. S., at 442, n. 4.  Likewise, in Bowles v. Russell,551 U. S. 205 (2007), we held that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is jurisdictional, without a word about Irwin.[4]  In Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___, ___–___, ___–___, (2013) (slip op., at 6–7, 11–13), we considered Irwin only after deciding that a deadline was not jurisdictional.  And in Holland, we held that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996’s time limits are not jurisdictional, without relying on Irwin, and then stated that “[w]e have previously made clear that a nonjurisdictional federal statute of limitations is normally subject to a ‘rebuttable presumption’ in favor ‘of equitable tolling.’ ”  560 U. S., at 645–646 (quoting Irwin, supra, at 95–96) (emphasis deleted); cf. Young v. United States,535 U. S. 43–50 (2002) (invoking Irwin after concluding that a limitations period was not a “substantive” component of the Bankruptcy Code).[5]                      This error matters because the majority’s jurisdictional analysis literally begins and ends with Irwin, see ante, at 4–5, 18, and thus relies on a presumption that should have no bearing on the question.  Without that presumption, the majority could not so readily ignore the unmistakable evidence that §2401(b)’s limits are jurisdictional.
															*  *  *
															                    For these reasons, I would hold that §2401(b) does not allow equitable tolling, and I therefore respectfully dissent.Notes1 At times in the past we have too loosely conferred the “jurisdic-tional” label.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment,523 U. S. 83,90 (1998).  But our use of the term in this context was conscious, as we recognized in John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States,552 U. S. 130,134 (2008) (“Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, said the statute was ‘jurisdiction[al],’ . . . and that ‘it [was] the duty of the court to raise the [timeliness] question whether it [was] done by plea or not’ ” (quoting Kendall v. United States,107 U. S. 123,125 (1883))).  And it was correct.2 Congress has occasionally modified the FTCA’s limitations provision.  Initially, the Act required plaintiffs to file suit within one year of a claim’s accrual, or if the claim was for less than $1,000 to present the claim to the appropriate agency within one year of accrual.  FTCA §420,60Stat.845.  In 1949, to relieve the hardship of the 1-year deadline, Congress enlarged the filing deadline to two years.  Act of Apr. 25, ch. 92, §1,63Stat.62.  Then, in 1966, it made the filing of an administrative claim with the appropriate agency a prerequisite to filing suit, and it shortened the litigation filing deadline to six months from the agency’s denial of the claim.  Act of July 18, §§2(a), 7,80Stat.306,307.  But Congress has never suggested that the deadlines could be excused or enlarged by the courts.3 The majority relies on the fact that we have allowed equitable tolling under “forever barred” language in the Clayton Act.  See ante, at 10.  But there is no evidence that Congress meant to import that statute’s terms into the FTCA.  Nor does the Clayton Act involve the waiver of sovereign immunity for money damages against the Government.  The Tucker Act, by contrast, was clearly the blueprint for the FTCA’s time bar, it did involve a waiver of sovereign immunity, and our cases have uniformly held that its language is not subject to equitable tolling.4 Even the dissent in Bowles recognized Irwin’s irrelevance: It cited the decision only when discussing equitable exceptions to nonjurisdictional statutes of limitations.  551 U. S., at 219 (opinion of Souter, J.).5 We considered Irwin in John R. Sand & Gravel while holding that28 U. S. C. §2501’s time limits are jurisdictional.  But we did so only to reject the suggestion that Irwin compelled a contrary result.  So there, too, Irwin’s presumption did not influence the jurisdictional question.  Nor did it influence the outcome in Irwin itself, where we held that equitable tolling was not available.  See 498 U. S., at 96.
