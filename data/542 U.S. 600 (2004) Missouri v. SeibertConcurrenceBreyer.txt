BREYER, J., CONCURRING
MISSOURI V. SEIBERT
542 U. S. ____ (2004)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 02-1371

															MISSOURI, PETITIONER v. PATRICE
SEIBERT

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
missouri

															[June 28, 2004]

															   Justice Breyer, concurring.

															   In my view, the following simple
rule should apply to the two-stage interrogation technique: Courts
should exclude the “fruits” of the initial unwarned
questioning unless the failure to warn was in good faith. Cf.
Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 309, 318,
n. 5 (1985); United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984). I
believe this is a sound and workable approach to the problem this
case presents. Prosecutors and judges have long understood how to
apply the “fruits” approach, which they use in other
areas of law. See Wong Sun v. United States,
371 U. S. 471
(1963). And in the workaday world of criminal law enforcement the
administrative simplicity of the familiar has significant
advantages over a more complex exclusionary rule. Cf.
post, at 6–7 (O’Connor, J., dissenting).

															   I believe the plurality’s approach in
practice will function as a “fruits” test. The truly
“effective” Miranda warnings on which the
plurality insists, ante, at 13–14, will occur only
when certain circumstances—a lapse in time, a change in
location or interrogating officer, or a shift in the focus of the
questioning—intervene between the unwarned questioning and
any postwarning statement. Cf. Taylor v. Alabama,
457 U. S. 687,
690 (1982) (evidence obtained subsequent to a constitutional
violation must be suppressed as “fruit of the poisonous
tree” unless “intervening events break the causal
connection”).

															   I consequently join the plurality’s
opinion in full. I also agree with Justice Kennedy’s
opinion insofar as it is consistent with this approach and makes
clear that a good-faith exception applies. See post, at 5
(opinion concurring in judgment).
