															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC., PETITIONER v. PAUL SOMERS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[February 21, 2018]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito and Justice Gorsuch join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I join the Court’s opinion only to the extent it relies on the text of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank),

124Stat.
1376.  The question in this case is whether the term “whistleblower” in Dodd-Frank’s antiretaliation provision,

15 U. S. C. §78u–6(h)(1), includes a person who does not report information to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The answer is in the definitions section of the statute, which states that the term “whistleblower” means a person who provides “information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.”  §78u–6(a)(6).  As the Court observes, this statutory definition “resolves the question before us.”  Ante, at 9.  The Court goes on, however, to discuss the supposed “purpose” of the statute, which it primarily derives from a single Senate Report.  See ante, at 3–4, 11–12, 16–18.  Even assuming a majority of Congress read the Senate Report, agreed with it, and voted for Dodd-Frank with the same intent, “we are a government of laws, not of men, and are governed by what Congress enacted rather than by what it intended.”[1]  Lawson v. FMR LLC,

571 U. S. 429
, ___ (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  And “it would be a strange canon of statutory construction that would require Congress to state in committee reports . . . that which is obvious on the face of a statute.”  Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc.,

446 U. S. 578,
592 (1980)
.  For these reasons, I am unable to join the portions of the Court’s opinion that venture beyond the statutory text.
Notes

 For what it is worth, I seriously doubt that a committee report is a “particularly reliable source” for discerning “Congress’ intended meaning.”  Ante, at 1 (Sotomayor, J., concurring).  The following exchange on the Senate floor is telling: “Mr. ARMSTRONG.  Mr. President, will the Senator tell me whether or not he wrote the committee report? “Mr. DOLE.  Did I write the committee report? “Mr. ARMSTRONG.  Yes. “Mr. DOLE.  No; the Senator from Kansas did not write the com-mittee report. “Mr. ARMSTRONG.  Did any Senator write the committee report? “Mr. DOLE.  I have to check. “Mr. ARMSTRONG.  Does the Senator know of any Senator who wrote the committee report? “Mr. DOLE.  I might be able to identify one, but I would have to search.  I was here all during the time it was written, I might say, and worked carefully with the staff as they worked. . . . “Mr. ARMSTRONG.  Mr. President, has the Senator from Kansas, the chairman of the Finance Committee, read the committee report in its entirety? “Mr. DOLE.  I am working on it.  It is not a bestseller, but I am working on it. “Mr. ARMSTRONG.  Mr. President, did members of the Finance Committee vote on the committee report? “Mr. DOLE.  No. “Mr. ARMSTRONG. . . . The report itself is not considered by the Committee on Finance.  It was not subject to amendment by the Committee on Finance.  It is not subject to amendment now by the Senate. . . . If there were matter within this report which was disagreed to by the Senator from Colorado or even by a majority of all Senators, there would be no way for us to change the report.  I could not offer an amendment tonight to amend the committee report. . . . [ L]et me just make the point that this is not the law, it was not voted on, it is not subject to amendment, and we should discipline ourselves to the task of expressing congressional intent in the statute.”  Hirschey v. FERC, 777 F. 2d 1, 7–8, n. 1 (CADC 1985) (Scalia, J., concurring) (quoting 128 Cong. Rec. 16918–16919 (1982)).  See also Kethledge, Ambiguities and Agency Cases: Reflections After (Almost) Ten Years on the Bench, 70 Vand. L. Rev. En Banc 315, 317–318 (2017) (describing his experience as a Senate staffer who drafted legislative history “like being a teenager at home while your parents are away for the weekend: there was no supervision.  I was able to write more or less what I pleased. . . . [ M ]ost members of Congress . . . have no idea at all about what is in the legislative history for a particular bill”).
