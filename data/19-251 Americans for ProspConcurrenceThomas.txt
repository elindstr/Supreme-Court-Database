															THOMAS MORE LAW CENTER, PETITIONER

															19–255v.

															ROB BONTA, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA

															on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[July 1, 2021]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in Parts I, II–A, II–B–2, and III–A, and concurring in the judgment.

															The Court correctly holds that California’s disclosure requirement violates the
 
First Amendment.  It also correctly concludes that the District Court properly enjoined California’s attorney general from collecting the forms at issue, which contain sensitive donor information.  But, while I agree with much of the Court’s opinion, I would approach three issues differently.

															First, the bulk of “our precedents . . . require application of strict scrutiny to laws that compel disclosure of protected
 
First Amendment association.”  Doe v. Reed,

561 U.S. 186, 232 (2010) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  California’s law fits that description.  Although the Court rightly holds that even the less demanding “exacting scrutiny” standard requires narrow tailoring for laws that compel disclosure, ante, at 9–11, invoking exacting scrutiny is at odds with our repeated recognition “that privacy of association is protected under the
 
First Amendment.”  561 U. S., at 240 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  The text and history of the Assembly Clause suggest that the right to assemble includes the right to associate anonymously.  See 4 Annals of Cong. 900–902, 941–942 (1795) (defending the Democratic-Republican societies, many of which met in secret, as exercising individuals’ “leave to assemble”); see also Brief for Becket Fund for Religious Liberty as Amicus Curiae 13–20; Reply Brief in No. 19–251, pp. 3–5; NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,

357 U.S. 449 (1958) (discussing the history of anonymous publications).  And the right to associate anonymously often operates as a vehicle to protect other
 
First Amendment rights, such as the freedom of the press.  McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n,

514 U.S. 334, 361–367 (1995) (Thomas, J., concurring) (“Founding-era Americans” understood the freedom of the press to include the right of printers and publishers not to be compelled to disclose the authors of anonymous works).  Laws directly burdening the right to associate anonymously, including compelled disclosure laws, should be subject to the same scrutiny as laws directly burdening other
 
First Amendment rights.  Doe, 561 U. S., at 232, 240.

															Second, the Court holds the law “overbroad” and, thus, invalid in all circumstances.  Ante, at 16.  But I continue to have “doubts about [the] origins and application” of our “overbreadth doctrine.”  United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1).  That doctrine purports to grant federal courts the power to invalidate a law “if a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional, judged in relation to the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.”  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  However, the Court has no power to enjoin the lawful application of a statute just because that statute might be unlawful as-applied in other circumstances.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9); Borden v. United States, 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4) (“a court cannot, consistent with separation of powers, enjoin enforcement of a statute where enforcement would be lawful”).  And the principle that application of a law is always unlawful if “ ‘a substantial number of its applications are unconstitutional’ ” “lacks any basis in the Constitution’s text” and “contravenes traditional standing principles.”  Sineneng-Smith, 590 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1).

															Third, and relatedly, this Court also lacks the power “to ‘pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in all applications,’ ” even if the Court suspects that the law will likely be unconstitutional in every future application as opposed to just a substantial number of its applications.  Borden, 593 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3) (quoting Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S 41, 77 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).  A declaration that the law is “facially” unconstitutional “seems to me no more than an advisory opinion—which a federal court should never issue at all.”  593 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3).  Courts cannot “strike down statutory text” or resolve the legal rights of litigants not before them.  Ibid. (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).

															Despite the Court’s use of the term “facially unconstitutional,” I join Part III–A, which finds that California’s law fails exacting scrutiny, because the Court does not say that it is “provid[ing] relief beyond the parties to the case.”  Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6).  The Court simply (and correctly) holds that the District Court properly enjoined the law as applied to petitioners.  Ante, at 19.  The Court’s judgment is also not dependent on its overbreadth determination.  Ante, at 12–15.  One can understand the Court’s reasoning as based on the fundamental legal problems with the law (that are obvious in light of the facts of this suit) that will, in practice, prevent California from lawfully applying the disclosure requirement against a substantial number of entities, including petitioners.

															With those points of difference clarified, I join Parts I, II–A, II–B–2, and III–A of the majority’s opinion and concur in the judgment.
