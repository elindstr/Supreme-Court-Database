ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
UNITED
STATES FOR THE DISTRICT OF
KENTUCKY
Syllabus

															Jurisdiction. The judicial act authorizes the Supreme Court to
issue writs of error to bring up any final judgment or decree in a
civil action or suit in equity depending in the circuit court,
&c. But a judgment awarding a writ of restitution to an action
of ejectment, where, in the execution of a writ of habere
facias possessionem, the sheriff had improperly turned a
person out of possession, is not a final judgment in civil action;
it is no more than the action of the court on its own process,
which is submitted to its own discretion. This Court takes no
jurisdiction in such a case.

															In the circuit court, the defendants in error filed a petition
in May, 1830, setting forth that on the demise of Richard Smith, an
action of ejectment was instituted in the circuit court against
Richard Fenn, with notice to Hiram Bryant and William Bryant and
others; that the Bryants were tenants to the petitioners and to
Robert Trabue, who appeared to the ejectment, had his tenants
entered as defendants; and a judgment was rendered at May term,
1828, against them. No writ of habere facias possessionem
was issued on this judgment, and at November term, 1818, a judgment
was rendered against other tenants, and on that judgment a writ of
habere facias possessionem was issued, and the marshal of
the District of Kentucky, under this last judgment and writ, turned
out of possession John Evans, who was a tenant of the petitioners,
resident on the same place occupied by the Bryants when the suit
was first brought and judgment rendered, and then possessed by the
petitioners. The record showed that this writ of habere facias
possessionem issued on 17 November, 1829.

															At May term of the court in 1830, a motion was made in behalf of
the petitioners, and a rule awarded on Smith the plaintiff in error
and defendant in the petition, to show cause why a writ of
restitution should not be awarded to them to restore the possession
of the tenements held by their tenants, John Evans and others,
taken from them by the marshal on

															the writ of possession mentioned in their petition. The
marshal's return showed that he had turned John Evans, James
McGuire, and William Acres, who were the tenants of the
petitioners, out of possession.

															At May term, 1831, the court ordered a writ of restitution to be
awarded to the petitioners, the plaintiffs in the motion, to
restore them to the possession of the land from which their tenants
had been removed by the marshal. To the opinion of the circuit
court in overruling objections made by the defendant's counsel to
the objects of the motion, and awarding possession to the
plaintiffs, the defendant, now plaintiff in error, excepted and
prosecuted this writ of error.

															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															This is a writ of error to a judgment of restitution awarded by
the court of the United States for the Seventh Circuit and District
of Kentucky, whereby the tenant of the defendants in error was
restored to the possession of a tract of land from which he had
been improperly removed, under the process of that court.

															The defendants in error filed their petition in the circuit
court, stating that a declaration of ejectment had been brought by
John Doe, on the demise of Samuel Smith, and notice served on Hiram
and William Bryant, the tenants of the petitioners, and a judgment
was rendered against them in May term 1818, on which no writ of
habere facias possessionem has been issued.

															In November term, 1818, a judgment was rendered against other
tenants, by virtue of which the marshal turned John Evans out of
possession, who, as tenant of the petitioners, resided on the place
which had been occupied by the Bryants.

															A rule to show cause was granted, and on its return restitution
was awarded. To this judgment of restitution this writ of error is
awarded.

															The judicial act authorizes this Court to issue writs of error
to bring up any final judgment or decree in a civil action or suit
in equity, depending in the circuit court, &c.

															This is not a final judgment in a civil action, nor a decree in
a court of equity. It is no more than the action of a court on its
own process, which is submitted to its own discretion. This Court
takes no jurisdiction in such a case. It is not, we think, given by
the judicial act.

															The writ of error is quashed and the suit dismissed, the
court having no jurisdiction.

															In error to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Kentucky.

															This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of
Kentucky, and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof, it
is the opinion of this Court that this is not a final judgment in a
civil action, nor a decree in a court of equity, but no more than
the action of a court on its own process, which is submitted to its
own discretion, and that the Court cannot take jurisdiction in such
a case, it not being given by the judicial act, and that the writ
of error must be quashed and the suit dismissed, the Court having
no jurisdiction. Whereupon it is considered, ordered, and adjudged
by this Court, that this writ of error be, and the same is hereby
dismissed for the want of jurisdiction.
