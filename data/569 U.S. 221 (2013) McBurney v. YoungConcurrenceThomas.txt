															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															MARK J. McBURNEY, et al., PETITIONERS
v. NA- THANIEL L. YOUNG, DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AND DIRECTOR,
VIRGINIA DIVISION OF CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[April 29, 2013]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion. Though the
Court has prop-erly applied our dormant Commerce Clause precedents,
I continue to adhere to my view that “[t]he negative Commerce
Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little
sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application, and,
consequently, cannot serve as a basis for striking down a state
statute.” Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons,
539 U.S.
59, 68 (2003) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in
part) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
