															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc., et al., PETITIONERS v. Kevin P. Bruen, in his official capacity as Superintendent of New York State Police, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

															[June 23, 2022]

															

															Justice Barrett, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full.  I write separately to highlight two methodological points that the Court does not resolve.  First, the Court does not conclusively determine the manner and circumstances in which postratification practice may bear on the original meaning of the Constitution.  See ante, at 24–29.  Scholars have proposed competing and potentially conflicting frameworks for this analysis, including liquidation, tradition, and precedent.  See, e.g., Nelson, Originalism and Interpretive Conventions, 70 U. Chi. L. Rev. 519 (2003); McConnell, Time, Institutions, and Interpretation, 95 B. U. L. Rev. 1745 (2015).  The limits on the permissible use of history may vary between these frameworks (and between different articulations of each one).  To name just a few unsettled questions: How long after ratification may subsequent practice illuminate original public meaning?  Cf. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 401 (1819) (citing practice “introduced at a very early period of our history”).  What form must practice take to carry weight in constitutional analysis?  See Myers v. United States,

272 U.S. 52, 175 (1926) (citing a “legislative exposition of the Constitution . . . acquiesced in for a long term of years”).  And may practice settle the meaning of individual rights as well as structural provisions?  See Baude, Constitutional Liquidation, 71 Stan. L. Rev. 1, 49–51 (2019) (canvassing arguments).  The historical inquiry presented in this case does not require us to answer such questions, which might make a difference in another case.  See ante, at 17–19.

															Second and relatedly, the Court avoids another “ongoing scholarly debate on whether courts should primarily rely on the prevailing understanding of an individual right when the
 
Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868” or when the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791.  Ante, at 29.  Here, the lack of support for New York’s law in either period makes it unnecessary to choose between them.  But if 1791 is the benchmark, then New York’s appeals to Reconstruction-era history would fail for the independent reason that this evidence is simply too late (in addition to too little).  Cf. Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, 591 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2020) (slip op., at 15–16) (a practice that “arose in the second half of the 19th century . . . cannot by itself establish an early American tradition” informing our understanding of the
 
First Amendment).  So today’s decision should not be understood to endorse freewheeling reliance on historical practice from the mid-to-late 19th century to establish the original meaning of the Bill of Rights.  On the contrary, the Court is careful to caution “against giving postenactment history more weight than it can rightly bear.”  Ante, at 26.
