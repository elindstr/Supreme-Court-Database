															EDWARD G. McDONOUGH, PETITIONER v. YOUEL SMITH, individually and as SPECIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE COUNTY OF  RENSSELAER, NEW YORK,  aka TREY SMITH

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

															[June 20, 2019]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting.

															We granted certiorari to decide when “the statute of limitations for a Section 1983 claim based on fabrication of evidence in criminal proceedings begins to run.”  Pet. for Cert. i.  McDonough, however, declined to take a definitive position on the “threshold inquiry in a [42 U. S. C.] §1983 suit”: “ ‘identify[ing] the specific constitutional right’ at issue.”  Manuel v. Joliet, 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 12) (quoting Albright v. Oliver,

510 U.S. 266, 271 (1994) (plurality opinion)).  Because it is only “[a]fter pinpointing that right” that courts can proceed to “determine the elements of, and rules associated with, an action seeking damages for its violation,” Manuel, 580 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12), we should have dismissed this case as improvidently granted.

															McDonough’s failure to specify which constitutional right the respondent allegedly violated profoundly complicates our inquiry.  McDonough argues that malicious prosecution is the common-law tort most analogous to his fabrication-of-evidence claim.  But without “ ‘identify[ing] the specific constitutional right’ at issue,” we cannot adhere to the contours of that right when “applying, selecting among, or adjusting common-law approaches.”  Ibid.  McDonough also contends that his suit is timely because he suffered a continuing constitutional violation, but this argument is similarly difficult to evaluate without identifying precisely what that violation was.  Moreover, because the constitutional basis for McDonough’s claim is unclear, we are unable to confirm that he has a constitutional claim at all.  In my view, it would be both logical and prudent to address that antecedent question before addressing the statute of limitations for that claim.

															McDonough also urges us to resolve the question presented by extending Preiser v. Rodriguez,

411 U.S. 475 (1973), and Heck v. Humphrey,

512 U.S. 477 (1994).  But the analysis under both cases depends on what facts a §1983 plaintiff would need to prove to prevail on his claim.[1]  And McDonough declines to take a position on that issue as well.  See Brief for Petitioner 19 (“The Court thus does not need to delve into what the elements of McDonough’s constitutional claim are”); see also id., at 37–38, n. 11.

															Further complicating this case, McDonough raised a malicious-prosecution claim alongside his fabrication-of-evidence claim.  The District Court dismissed that claim on grounds of absolute immunity.  McDonough has not fully explained the difference between that claim and his fabrication claim, which he insists is both analogous to the common-law tort of malicious prosecution and distinct from his dismissed malicious-prosecution claim.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11–12; Reply Brief 3–4.  Additionally, it appears that McDonough’s fabrication claim could face dismissal on absolute-immunity grounds on remand.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29–32.

															The Court, while recognizing that it is critical to ascertain the basis for a §1983 claim when deciding how to “handl[e]” it, ante, at 5, n. 2, attempts to evade these issues by “assum[ing] without deciding that the Second Circuit’s articulations of the right at issue and its contours are sound.”  Ante, at 4–5.  But because the parties have not accepted the Second Circuit’s view that the claim sounds in procedural due process,[2] that claim as “articulated by the Court of Appeals” might be different from the claim McDonough actually brought.  Ante, at 9.  The better course would be to dismiss this case as improvidently granted and await a case in which the threshold question of the basis of a “fabrication-of-evidence” claim is cleanly presented.  Moreover, even if the Second Circuit were correct that McDonough asserts a violation of the Due Process Clause, it would be preferable for the Court to determine the claim’s elements before deciding its statute of limitations.

															*  *  *

															McDonough asks the Court to bypass the antecedent question of the nature and elements of his claim and first determine its statute of limitations.  We should have declined the invitation and dismissed the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.  I therefore respectfully dissent.

 See Preiser, 411 U. S., at 500 (“[W]hen a state prisoner is challenging the very fact or duration of his physical imprisonment, and the relief he seeks is a determination that he is entitled to immediate release or a speedier release from that imprisonment,” he cannot bring suit under §1983); Heck, 512 U. S., at 486–487 (“[T]o recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment . . . a §1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been” reversed, expunged, invalidated, or otherwise called into question); accord, id., at 486, n. 6 (explaining that a §1983 action will not lie where a plaintiff would have to negate an element of the offense of which he was convicted to succeed on his §1983 claim).
