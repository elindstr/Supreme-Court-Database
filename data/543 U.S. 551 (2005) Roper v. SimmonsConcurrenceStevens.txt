SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-633

															DONALD P. ROPER, SUPERINTENDENT, POTOSI
CORRECTIONAL CENTER, PETITIONER v. CHRISTOPHER SIMMONS

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
missouri

															[March 1, 2005]

															   Justice Stevens, with whom
Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring.

															   Perhaps even more important than
our specific holding today is our reaffirmation of the basic
principle that informs the Court’s interpretation of the
Eighth Amendment. If the meaning of that Amendment had been frozen
when it was originally drafted, it would impose no impediment to
the execution of 7-year-old children today. See Stanford
v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 368
(1989) (describing the common law at the time of the
Amendment’s adoption). The evolving standards of decency that
have driven our construction of this critically important part of
the Bill of Rights foreclose any such reading of the Amendment. In
the best tradition of the common law, the pace of that evolution is
a matter for continuing debate; but that our understanding of the
Constitution does change from time to time has been settled since
John Marshall breathed life into its text. If great lawyers of his
day—Alexander Hamilton, for example—were sitting with
us today, I would expect them to join Justice Kennedy’s
opinion for the Court. In all events, I do so without
hesitation.
