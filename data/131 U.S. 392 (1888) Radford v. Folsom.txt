															The final decree in a suit in equity, entered October 10, 1885, adjudged and decreed that there was due to the administratrix of J. F. a sum named in the decree, and that if, within ninety days from that date, the court should be satisfied that a certain other sum named as paid for the purchase of notes, etc., had inured to the benefit of J. F. or his estate, that sum should be credited on the amount so decreed to be paid.  Held that for the purpose of an appeal, the date of the decree was October 10, 1885.

															"That the appeal in the above entitled cause was not taken until the 30th day of December, 1887, more than two years after the entry of the decree, as aforesaid. "
