ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE
SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS
Syllabus 

															Certiorari granted; 249 Ark. 1075, 467 S.W.2d 707, reversed and remanded.

															PER CURIAM.

															The petition for writ of certiorari is granted.  Petitioner's alleged procedural default does not bar consideration of his constitutional claim in the circumstances of this case.  See Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U. S. 443,  379 U. S. 447-449 (1965).  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is reversed.  Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965).  The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.
