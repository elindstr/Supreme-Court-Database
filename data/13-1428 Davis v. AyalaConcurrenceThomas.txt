															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															RON DAVIS, ACTING WARDEN, PETITIONER v. HECTOR AYALA

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 18, 2015]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion explaining why Ayala is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus from this or any other federal court.  I write separately only to point out, in response to the separate opinion of Justice Kennedy, that the accommodations in which Ayala is housed are a far sight more spacious than those in which his victims, Ernesto Dominguez Mendez, Marcos Antonio Zamora, and Jose Luis Rositas, now rest.  And, given that his victims were all 31 years of age or under, Ayala will soon have had as much or more time to enjoy those accommodations as his victims had time to enjoy this Earth.
