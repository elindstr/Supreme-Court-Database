															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 19–635

															_________________

															DONALD J. TRUMP, PETITIONER v. CYRUS R. VANCE, Jr., in his official capacity as DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

															[July 9, 2020]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring in the judgment.

															The Court today unanimously concludes that a President does not possess absolute immunity from a state criminal subpoena, but also unanimously agrees that this case should be remanded to the District Court, where the President may raise constitutional and legal objections to the subpoena as appropriate.  See ante, at 21–22, and n. 6; post, at 11–12 (Thomas, J., dissenting); post, at 16–19 (Alito, J., dissenting).  I agree with those two conclusions.

															*  *  *

															The dispute over this grand jury subpoena reflects a conflict between a State’s interest in criminal investigation and a President’s Article II interest in performing his or her duties without undue interference.  Although this case involves personal information of the President and is therefore not an executive privilege case, the majority opinion correctly concludes based on precedent that Article II and the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution supply some protection for the Presidency against state criminal subpoenas of this sort.

															In our system of government, as this Court has often stated, no one is above the law.  That principle applies, of course, to a President.  At the same time, in light of Article II of the Constitution, this Court has repeatedly declared—and the Court indicates again today—that a court may not proceed against a President as it would against an ordinary litigant.  See Cheney v. United States Dist. Court for D. C.,

542 U.S. 367, 381–382 (2004) (“In no case would a court be required to proceed against the president as against an ordinary individual” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); Clinton v. Jones,

520 U.S. 681, 704, n. 39 (1997) (a court may not “proceed against the president as against an ordinary individual” (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Nixon,

418 U.S. 683, 715 (1974) (“In no case of this kind would a court be required to proceed against the president as against an ordinary individual” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 192 (No. 14,694) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C. J.) (“In no case of this kind would a court be required to proceed against the president as against an ordinary individual”).

															The question here, then, is how to balance the State’s interests and the Article II interests.  The longstanding precedent that has applied to federal criminal subpoenas for official, privileged Executive Branch information is United States v. Nixon,

418 U.S. 683 (1974).  That landmark case requires that a prosecutor establish a “demonstrated, specific need” for the President’s information.  Id., at 713; see also In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 753–757 (CADC 1997); cf. Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, 498 F.2d 725, 730–731 (CADC 1974) (en banc) (similar standard for congressional subpoenas to the Executive Branch).

															The Nixon “demonstrated, specific need” standard is a tried-and-true test that accommodates both the interests of the criminal process and the Article II interests of the Presidency.  The Nixon standard ensures that a prosecutor’s interest in subpoenaed information is sufficiently important to justify an intrusion on the Article II interests of the Presidency.  The Nixon standard also reduces the risk of subjecting a President to unwarranted burdens, because it provides that a prosecutor may obtain a President’s information only in certain defined circumstances.

															Although the Court adopted the Nixon standard in a different Article II context—there, involving the confidentiality of official, privileged information—the majority opinion today recognizes that there are also important Article II (and Supremacy Clause) interests at stake here.  A state criminal subpoena to a President raises Article II and Supremacy Clause issues because of the potential for a state prosecutor to use the criminal process and issue subpoenas in a way that interferes with the President’s duties, through harassment or diversion.  Cf. Nixon v. Fitzgerald,

457 U.S. 731, 751–753 (1982).

															Because this case again entails a clash between the interests of the criminal process and the Article II interests of the Presidency, I would apply the longstanding Nixon “demonstrated, specific need” standard to this case.  The majority opinion does not apply the Nixon standard in this distinct Article II context, as I would have done.  That said, the majority opinion appropriately takes account of some important concerns that also animate Nixon and the Constitution’s balance of powers.  The majority opinion explains that a state prosecutor may not issue a subpoena for a President’s personal information out of bad faith, malice, or an intent to harass a President, ante, at 16; as a result of prosecutorial impropriety, ibid.; to seek information that is not relevant to an investigation, ante, at 16, 19–20; that is overly broad or unduly burdensome, ante, at 19–20; to manipulate, influence, or retaliate against a President’s official acts or policy decisions, ante, at 17, 20; or in a way that would impede, conflict with, or interfere with a President’s official duties, ante, at 20–21.  All nine Members of the Court agree, moreover, that a President may raise objections to a state criminal subpoena not just in state court but also in federal court.[1]  And the majority opinion indicates that, in light of the “high respect that is owed to the office of the Chief Executive,” courts “should be particularly meticulous” in assessing a subpoena for a President’s personal records.  Ante, at 20 (quoting Clinton, 520 U. S., at 707, and Nixon, 418 U. S., at 702).

															In the end, much may depend on how the majority opinion’s various standards are applied in future years and decades.[2]  It will take future cases to determine precisely how much difference exists between (i) the various standards articulated by the majority opinion, (ii) the overarching Nixon “demonstrated, specific need” standard that I would adopt, and (iii) Justice Thomas’s and Justice Alito’s other proposed standards.  In any event, in my view, lower courts in cases of this sort involving a President will almost invariably have to begin by delving into why the State wants the information; why and how much the State needs the information, including whether the State could obtain the information elsewhere; and whether compliance with the subpoena would unduly burden or interfere with a President’s official duties.

															*  *  *

															I agree that the case should be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings, where the President may raise constitutional and legal objections to the state grand jury subpoena as appropriate.
Notes
1
 As I see it, the standards identified by the majority opinion should be considered, in this context, Article II requirements, not just statutory or state-law requirements.  Cf. Cheney v. United States Dist. Court for D. C.,

542 U.S. 367, 385–392 (2004); Clinton v. Jones,

520 U.S. 681, 707 (1997); Nixon v. Fitzgerald,

457 U.S. 731, 749–757 (1982); United States v. Nixon,

418 U.S. 683, 714–716 (1974).

 The same point—namely, that much may depend on future application—is also true of the four considerations articulated by the Court today in Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, post, at 19–20.
