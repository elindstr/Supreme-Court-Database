															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 13â€“975

															_________________

															T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC, PETITIONER v.CITY OF ROSWELL,
GEORGIA

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the eleventh circuit

															[January 14, 2015]

															Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
and with whom Justice Thomas joins as to Part I,
dissenting.

															The statute at issue in this case provides that
â€œ[a]ny decision .Â .Â . to
deny a request .Â .Â . shall be in writing
and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written
record.â€47 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§332(c)(7)(B)(iii). The Court concludes that the City
loses this case not because it failed to provide its denial in
writing. It did provide its denial in writing. Nor does the City
lose because the denial was not supported by substantial evidence
in a written record. The City compiled a written record; whether
that record contained substantial evidence supporting the denial is
not at issue here and has not been decided. Nor does the City lose
because its denial was not accompanied by a statement of reasons
apart from the written record. A sharp conflict had developed in
the lower courts over the necessity of such a separate statement,
and the Court today squarely holds that one is not required.
Ante, at 5, 8â€“11. No, the City instead
loses because of a question of timing: The written record was not
made available roughly the same day as the
denialâ€”a requirement found nowhere in the text
of the statute.

															The Court says this timing requirement is necessary for judicial
review of whether the denial is supported by substantial evidence.
A reviewing court, however, can carry out its function just as
easily whether the record is submitted four weeks or four days
before the lawsuit is filedâ€”or four days
after, for that matter. The Court also supports its timing
rule by saying that the company whose application is denied needs
the time to carefully consider whether to seek review. But cell
service providers are not Mom and Pop operations. As this case
illustrates, they participate extensively in the local government
proceedings, and do not have to make last-second, uninformed
decisions on whether to seek review.

															The City here fully complied with its obligations under the
statute: It issued its decision in writing, and it sub-mitted a
written record containingâ€”so far as we
knowâ€”substantial evidence supporting that
decision. I respectfully dissent from the
Courtâ€™s contrary conclusion.

															I

															Section 332(c)(7), enacted as part of the Telecommunications Act
of 1996, places several limits on local
governmentsâ€™ authority to regulate the siting of
cell towers and other telecommunications facilities. A
localityâ€™s regulations must not unreasonably
discriminate among service providers, effectively prohibit the
provision of service, or rest on concerns about the environmental
effects of radio emissions. See
Â§Â§332(c)(7)(B)(i), (iv). In addition, the
provision central to this case specifies that
â€œ[a]ny decision by a State or local government
.Â .Â . to deny a request to place,
construct, or modifyâ€ a cell tower
â€œshall be in writing and supported by
substantial evidence contained in a written record.â€
Â§332(c)(7)(B)(iii). And another provision authorizes
expedited judicial review of a localityâ€™s
alleged failure to comply with these rules. See
Â§332(c)(7)(B)(v).

															After the city council of Roswell voted to deny
T-Mobileâ€™s application to build a cell tower,
the City sent T-Mobile a short letter that announced the denial but
provided no further explanation. The question T-Mobile has
presented to this Court is whether such a letter satisfies the
â€œdecision .Â .Â . in
writingâ€ requirement of Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii). See
Pet. for Cert. i.

															I would hold it does. The Cityâ€™s letter was
certainly in writing. And it certainly memorialized the denial of
T-Mobileâ€™s application. So
T-Mobileâ€™s only hope is that the lack of
explanation for the denial means the letter isnot truly a
â€œdecision.â€ But like the majority, I
reject T-Mobileâ€™s contention that the term
â€œdecisionâ€ inherently demands a
statement of reasons. Dictionary definitions support that
conclusion. See ante, at 12 (citing
Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary); see also B. Garner, A
Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 251 (2d ed. 1995) (grouping
â€œdecisionâ€ with
â€œjudgment,â€ as distinct from
â€œopinionâ€).

															A comparison between Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) and other
statutory provisions that were on the books in 1996 also suggests
that when Congress wants decisionmakers to supply explanations, it
says so. Consider first the Administrative Procedure Act. In the
context of formal adjudication and rulemaking, it demands that
â€œdecisions .Â .Â . include
a statement of .Â .Â . findings and
conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor, on all the
material issues.â€5 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§557(c)(A) (1994 ed.) (emphasis added). Even in
informal proceedings, an agency must give prompt notice of the
denial of a written application, and, â€œ[e]xcept
in affirming a prior denial or when the denial is self-explanatory,
the notice shall be accompanied by a brief statement of the
grounds for denial.â€ Â§555(e) (emphasis
added).

															The Communications Act of 1934, which the Telecommunications Act
overhauled, itself contains a similar express requirement. Section
309 allows an interested party to petition the Federal
Communications Commission to deny a license application.47
U.Â S.Â C. Â§309(d)(1) (1994 ed.).
If the FCC decides to grant an application despite such a petition,
it must â€œissue a concise statement of the
reasons for denying the petition.â€
Â§309(d)(2). And a provision added along with Section
332(c)(7) in the Telecommunications Act provides that when the FCC
grants or denies a petition for regulatory forbearance, it
â€œshall explain its decision in
writing.â€ Â§160(c) (2000 ed.) (emphasis
added). Many other statutes in effect in 1996 could be added to the
list. See, e.g., 19 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§1515(a) (1994 ed.) (notice of customs protest denial
â€œshall include a statement of the reasons for
the denialâ€);30 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§944 (1994 ed.) (individual whose claim for black lung
benefits â€œis denied shall receive
.Â .Â . a written statement of the reasons
for denialâ€);38 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§5104(b) (1994 ed.) (notice of denial of veterans
benefits must include â€œa statement of the
reasons for the decisionâ€).

															Given the commonplace nature of express requirements that
reasons be givenâ€”and the inclusion of such
provisions in the Administrative Procedure Act, the original
Communications Act, and another provision of the Telecommunications
Actâ€”the absence of one in Section
332(c)(7)(B)(iii) is telling, and supports reading
â€œdecision .Â .Â . in
writingâ€ to demand nothing more than what it says: a
written document that communicates the townâ€™s
denial.

															In my view, resolving that interpretive question in the
Cityâ€™s favor also resolves the case as it stands
in this Court. Although Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) goes on to
require that a denial be â€œsupported by
substantial evidence contained in a written record,â€
the adequacy of the Cityâ€™s written record is not
properly before us. As the Eleventh Circuit noted in its opinion
below, the â€œsole issueâ€ before it
was the â€œin writingâ€ requirement; it
did not examine whether the Cityâ€™s denial was
supported by substantial evidence. 731 F.Â 3d 1213,
1221, n.Â 7 (2013). The Court today
alsoâ€”correctlyâ€”does not
decide whether substantial evidence supported the
Cityâ€™s denial. The Eleventh
Circuitâ€™s judgment therefore ought to be
affirmed and the case remanded to the District Court for further
proceedings on T-Mobileâ€™s remaining
challenges.

															II

															The Court agrees that the City was not required to explain its
reasoning in its denial letter, but it nonetheless rules for
T-Mobile. The improbable linchpin of this outcome is the
Cityâ€™s failure to finalize the minutes of the
April 12 city council meeting until May 10. Improbable because, so
far as I can tell, T-Mobile never even mentioned this timeline, let
alone based an argument on it, in its filings in the lower courts
or its petition for certiorari. Nor did the Eleventh Circuit
address this timing question in any way. Cf. Zivotofsky v.
Clinton, 566 U.Â S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at
12) (â€œOrdinarily, we do not decide in the first
instance issues not decided below.â€ (internal quotation
marks omitted)).

															The Court nonetheless rules against Roswell on this ground,
proceeding in two steps: First it concludes that a town must
provide written reasons in some form (the minutes being the
only candidate here); then it decides a town must make those
reasons available â€œessentially
contemporaneouslyâ€ with its decision (the final minutes
were not). Ante, at 14. In my view, the first step is
justified by the statutory text, but the second is not.

															The need to provide reasons in some form follows from the
portion of Section 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) requiring that denials be
â€œsupported by substantial evidence contained in
a written record.â€ Like the majority, I read this
phrase as specifying a familiar standard of review to be used if a
denial is challenged in court. And like the majority, I agree that
substantial evidence review requires that a
decisionmakerâ€™s reasons be identifiable in the
written record. If a reviewing court cannot identify any of a
townâ€™s reasons for denying an application, it
cannot determine whether substantial evidence supports those
reasons, and the town loses.

															But then the Court goes a step further and creates a timing
rule: A town must provide â€œits written reasons
at essentially the same time as it communicates its
denial.â€ Ante, at 10. This timing rule is
nowhere to be found in the text of Section
332(c)(7)(B)â€”text that expressly
establishes other time limits, both general and specific. See
Â§332(c)(7)(B)(ii) (requiring localities to act on
siting requests â€œwithin a reasonable period of
timeâ€); Â§332(c)(7)(B)(v) (giving injured
parties 30 days to seek judicial review). Despite its assertion
that the statuteâ€™s
â€œenumerated limitationsâ€ constitute
â€œan exclusive list,â€ ante, at
9, the Court offers two justifications for its inference of this
additional, unenumerated limitation.

															The first is that â€œa court cannot review the
denial without knowing the localityâ€™s
reasons,â€ so it would
â€œstymieâ€ judicial review to allow
delay between the issuance of the decision and the statement of
reasons. Ante, at 10. This makes little sense. The
Courtâ€™s â€œessentially
contemporaneousâ€ requirement presumably means the town
must produce its reasons within a matter of days (though the
majority never says how many). But a reviewing court does not need
to be able to discern the townâ€™s reasons within
mere days of the decision. At that point no one has even asked the
court to review the denial. The fact that a court cannot conduct
review without knowing the reasons simply means that if the town
has not already made the record available, it must do so by
whatever deadline the court sets. The court should proceed
â€œon an expedited basis,â€
Â§332(c)(7)(B)(v), but that hardly means it will need
the record within days of the townâ€™s decision.
And in this case there is no indication that the
Cityâ€™s submission of the written record was
untimely or delayed the District Courtâ€™s
review.

															The Courtâ€™s second justification focuses on
the denied applicant, which must choose within 30 days from the
denial whether to take the town to court.
Â§332(c)(7)(B)(v). â€œ[W]ithout knowing
the localityâ€™s reasons,â€ the
majority says, the applicant â€œmay not be able to
make a considered decision whether to seek judicial
review.â€ Ante, at 10. This concern might have
force if towns routinely made these decisions in secret,
closed-door proceedings, or if applicants were unsophisticated
actors. But the local zoning board or town council is not the Star
Chamber, and a telecommunications company is no babe in the legal
woods. Almost invariably in cases addressing Section 332(c)(7), the
relevant local authority has held an open meeting at which the
applicant was present and the issues publicly aired. In this case
and others, T-Mobile has brought its own court reporter, ensuring
that it has a verbatim transcript of the meeting well before the
town is likely to finalize its minutes. See Brief for Petitioner
12, n.Â 2; T-Mobile South, LLC v. City of
Milton, Georgia, 728 F.Â 3d 1274, 1277 (CA11 2013).
I strongly doubt that a sophisticated, well-lawyered company like
T-Mobileâ€”with extensive experience with these
particular types of proceedingsâ€”would have any
trouble consulting its interests and deciding whether to seek
review before it had received a written explanation from the town.
The Court worries about towns
â€œsandbagg[ing]â€ companies with
unexpected reasons, ante, at 10, n.Â 3, but if
those reasons in fact come out of nowhere, they will not be
supported by substantial evidence in the record. And if the
companyâ€™s initial complaint mistakes the
townâ€™s reasoning, the company will have no
difficulty amending its allegations. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
15(a).

															In sum, there is nothing impractical about reading the statutory
text to require only that the reasons implied by the term
â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ be
discernible to the court when it conducts substantial evidence
review. Demanding â€œessentially
contemporaneousâ€ written reasons adds a requirement
that Congress has included expressly in many other statutes, but
not in this one. See supra, at3â€“4.

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															For the foregoing reasons, the Courtâ€™s
opinion and judgment are wrong. But this is not a
â€œthe sky is fallingâ€ dissent. At the
end of the day, the impact on cities and towns across the Nation
should be small, although the new unwritten requirement could be a
trap for the unwary hamlet or two. All a local government need do
is withhold its final decision until the minutes are typed up, and
make the final decision and the record of proceedings (with
discernible reasons) available together.

															Todayâ€™s decision is nonetheless a bad break
for Roswell. Or maybe not. The Court leaves open the question of
remedy, ante, at 14, and it may be that failure to comply
with the â€œin writingâ€ requirement as
construed by the Court can be excused as harmless error in
appropriate cases. It is hard to see where the harm is here.
T-Mobile somehow managed to make the tough call to seek review of
the denial of an application it had spent months and many thousands
of dollars to obtain, based on a hearing it had attended. And
nothing about Roswellâ€™s failure to meet the
â€œcontemporaneouslyâ€ requirement
delayed, much less â€œstymied,â€
judicial review.

															The Court today resolves the conflict over whether a town must
provide a statement of reasons with its final decision, apart from
the written record. We now know it need not. As the Court explains,
â€œnothing in [the] text [of the Act] imposes any
requirement that the reasons be given in any particular
form,â€ and there is â€œin the Act no
commandâ€”either explicit or
implicitâ€”that localities must provide those
reasons in a specific document.â€ Ante, at 9.
Good analysisâ€”which also should have been
followed to reject the timing requirement the Court creates
today.

															I respectfully dissent.
