SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 06-666





															DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF KENTUCKY, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. GEORGE W. DAVIS et ux.

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of
kentucky

															[May 19, 2008]



															   Chief Justice Roberts, concurring in part.

															
   I join all but Part III–B of the opinion of the Court.  In my view, the case is readily resolved by last Term’s decision in United Haulers Assn., Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 550 U. S. ___ (2007).  A majority of the Court shares this view.  That being the case, I see no need to proceed to the alternative analysis in Part III–B.
