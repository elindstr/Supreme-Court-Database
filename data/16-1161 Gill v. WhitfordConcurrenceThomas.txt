															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															BEVERLY R. GILL, et al., APPELLANTS v. WILLIAM WHITFORD, et al.

															on appeal from the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin

															[June 18, 2018]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I join Parts I and II of the Court’s opinion because I agree that the plaintiffs have failed to prove Article III standing.  I do not join Part III, which gives the plaintiffs another chance to prove their standing on remand.  When a plaintiff lacks standing, our ordinary practice is to remand the case with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  E.g., Lance v. Coffman,

549 U. S. 437, 442 (2007) (per curiam); DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno,

547 U. S. 332, 354 (2006); United States v. Hays,

515 U. S. 737, 747 (1995).  The Court departs from our usual practice because this is supposedly “not the usual case.”  Ante, at 21.  But there is nothing unusual about it.  As the Court explains, the plaintiffs’ lack of standing follows from long-established principles of law.  See ante, at 13–17.  After a year and a half of litigation in the District Court, including a 4-day trial, the plaintiffs had a more-than-ample opportunity to prove their standing under these principles.  They failed to do so.  Accordingly, I would have remanded this case with instructions to dismiss.
