															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															MARK JANUS, PETITIONER v. AMERICAN FEDER- ATION OF STATE, COUNTY, AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES, COUNCIL 31, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 27, 2018]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, dissenting.

															I join Justice Kagan’s dissent in full.  Although I joined the majority in Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.,

564 U. S. 552 (2011), I disagree with the way that this Court has since interpreted and applied that opinion.  See, e.g., National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, ante,  p. ___.  Having seen the troubling development in
 
First Amendment jurisprudence over the years, both in this Court and in lower courts, I agree fully with Justice Kagan that Sorrell—in the way it has been read by this Court—has allowed courts to “wiel[d] the
 
First Amendment in . . . an aggressive way” just as the majority does today.  Post, at 27.
