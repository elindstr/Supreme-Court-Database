SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 07-1410





															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. NAVAJO NATION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the federal circuit

															[April 6, 2009]



															   Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens joins, concurring.

															
   I am not through regretting that my position in United States v. Navajo Nation, 537 U. S. 488, 514–521 (2003) (dissenting opinion), did not carry the day.  But it did not, and I agree that the precedent of that case calls for the result reached here.
