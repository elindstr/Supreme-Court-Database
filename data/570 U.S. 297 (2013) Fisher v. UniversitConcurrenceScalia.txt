															ABIGAIL NOEL FISHER, PETITIONER v. UNIVERSITY
OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 24, 2013]

															

															     Justice Scalia,
concurring.

															     I adhere to the view I
expressed in Grutter v. Bollinger: “The Constitution
proscribes government discrimination on the basis of race, and
state-provided education is no exception.” 539 U. S.
306, 349 (2003) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in
part). The petitioner in this case did not ask us to overrule
Grutter’s holding that a “compelling interest” in
the educational benefits of diversity can justify racial
preferences in university admissions. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8–9. I
therefore join the Court’s opinion in full.
