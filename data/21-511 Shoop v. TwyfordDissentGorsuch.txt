															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															TIM SHOOP, WARDEN, PETITIONER v. RAYMOND A. TWYFORD, III

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[June 21, 2022]

															

															Justice Gorsuch, dissenting.

															The Court granted review to decide whether and under what circumstances a federal district court may order a State to transport a prisoner to a hospital for testing.  Later, however, it became clear a potential jurisdictional defect threatened to preclude the Court from reaching that question.  The District Court’s transportation ruling was an interlocutory order, not a final judgment.  To address its merits, the Court would first have to extend the collateral order doctrine to a new class of cases.  See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,

337 U.S. 541, 545–547 (1949).  In a terse footnote today, the Court does just that.  Ante, at 5, n. 1.

															 Respectfully, I would have dismissed this case as improvidently granted when the jurisdictional complication became apparent.  We did not take this case to extend Cohen.    And this Court has repeatedly “admoni[shed]” other courts to keep “the class of collaterally appealable orders . . . ‘narrow and selective.’ ”  Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter,

558 U.S. 100, 113 (2009).  If anything, this call for caution “has acquired special force in recent years with the enactment of legislation designating rulemaking . . . as the preferred means for determining whether and when prejudgment orders should be immediately appealable.”  Ibid.
