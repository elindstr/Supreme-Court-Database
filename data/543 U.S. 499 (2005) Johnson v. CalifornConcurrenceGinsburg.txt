543 U. S. ____ (2005)
JOHNSON V. CALIFORNIA
543 U. S. ____ (2005)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-636

															GARRISON S. JOHNSON, PETITIONER v.
CALIFORNIA et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the ninth circuit

															[February 23, 2005]

															   Justice Ginsburg, with whom
Justice Souter and Justice Breyer join, concurring.

															   I join the Court’s opinion,
subject to the reservation expressed in Grutter v.
Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306,
344–346 (2003) (Ginsburg, J., concurring).

															   The Court today resoundingly reaffirms the
principle that state-imposed racial segregation is highly suspect
and cannot be justified on the ground that “ ‘all
persons suffer [the separation] in equal
degree.’ ” Ante, at 6 (quoting
Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410
(1991)). While I join that declaration without reservation, I write
separately to express again my conviction that the same standard of
review ought not control judicial inspection of every official race
classification. As I stated most recently in Gratz v.
Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244, 301
(2003) (dissenting opinion): “Actions designed to burden
groups long denied full citizenship stature are not sensibly ranked
with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched
discrimination and its aftereffects have been extirpated.”
See also Grutter, 539 U. S., at 344–346 (Ginsburg,
J., concurring); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.
Pe&nacute;a, 515 U. S. 200,
271–276 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).

															   There is no pretense here, however, that the
California Department of Corrections (CDC) installed its
segregation policy to “correct inequalities.” See
Wechsler, The Nationalization of Civil Liberties and Civil Rights,
Supp. to 12 Tex. Q. 10, 23 (1968). Experience in other States and
in federal prisons, see ante, at 7–8; post,
at 3–4 (Stevens, J., dissenting), strongly suggests that
CDC’s race-based assignment of new inmates and transferees,
administratively convenient as it may be, is not necessary to the
safe management of a penal institution.

															   Disagreeing with the Court that “strict
scrutiny” properly applies to any and all racial
classifications, see ante, at 4–9, 11–12, 14,
but agreeing that the stereotypical classification at hand warrants
rigorous scrutiny, I join the Court’s opinion.
