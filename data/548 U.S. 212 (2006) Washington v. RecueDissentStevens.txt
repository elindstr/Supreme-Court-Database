548 U. S. ____ (2006)
WASHINGTON V. RECUENCO
548 U. S. ____ (2006)
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 05-83

															WASHINGTON, PETITIONER v. ARTURO R.
RECUENCO

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
washington

															[June 26, 2006]

															   Justice Stevens, dissenting.

															   Like Brigham City v.
Stuart, 547 U. S. ___ (2006), and Kansas v.
Marsh, 548 U. S. ___ (2006), this is a case in which the
Court has granted review in order to make sure that a State’s
highest court has not granted its citizens any greater protection
than the bare minimum required by the Federal Constitution.
Ironically, the issue in this case is not whether
respondent’s federal constitutional rights were
violated—that is admitted—it is whether the Washington
Supreme Court’s chosen remedy for the violation is mandated
by federal law. As the discussion in Part II of the Court’s
opinion demonstrates, whether we even have jurisdiction to decide
that question is not entirely clear. But even if our expansionist
post-Michigan v. Long jurisprudence supports our
jurisdiction to review the decision below, see 463 U. S. 1032 (1983),
there was surely no need to reach out to decide this case. The
Washington Supreme Court can, of course, reinstate the same
judgment on remand, either for the reasons discussed in Part II of
the Court’s opinion, see ante, at 4, and n. 1,
or because that court chooses, as a matter of state law, to adhere
to its view that the proper remedy for Blakely errors, see
Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004), is
automatic reversal of the unconstitutional portion of a
defendant’s sentence. Moreover, because the Court does not
address the strongest argument in respondent’s
favor—namely, that Blakely errors are structural
because they deprive criminal defendants of sufficient notice
regarding the charges they must defend against, see ante,
at 7, n. 3—this decision will have a limited impact on
other cases.

															   As I did in Brigham City and
Marsh, I voted to deny certiorari in this case. Given the
Court’s decision to reach the merits, however, I would affirm
for the reasons stated in Justice Ginsburg’s opinion, which I
join.
