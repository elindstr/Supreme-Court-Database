															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 11–9335

															_________________

															ALLEN RYAN ALLEYNE, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[June 17, 2013]

															

															     Justice Sotomayor,
with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan join, concurring.

															     I join the opinion of
the Court, which persuasively explains why Harris v. United States,
536 U. S. 545 (2002) , and McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477
U. S. 79 (1986) , were wrongly decided. Under the reasoning of
our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000) ,
and the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment, facts that
increase the statutory minimum sentence (no less than facts that
increase the statutory maximum sentence) are elements of the
offense that must be found by a jury and proved beyond a reasonable
doubt. Ante, at 1.

															     Of course, under our
doctrine of stare decisis, establishing that a decision was wrong
does not, without more, justify overruling it. While stare decisis
is not an “inexorable command,” Hohn v. United States,
524 U. S. 236, 251 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted),
it is “a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial
Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of
fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not
based upon ‘an arbitrary discretion,’ ”
Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989)
(quoting The Federalist, No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A.
Hamilton)). We generally adhere to our prior decisions, even if we
question their soundness, because doing so “promotes the
evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal
principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes
to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial
process.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991)
. To protect these important values, we require a
“ ‘ “special
justification” ’ ” when departing from
precedent. Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443
(2000) .

															     A special justification
is present here. As an initial matter, when procedural rules are at
issue that do not govern primary conduct and do not implicate the
reliance interests of private parties, the force of stare decisis
is reduced. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521
(1995) ; Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. And any reliance interest
that the Federal Government and state governments might have is
particularly minimal here because prosecutors are perfectly able to
“charge facts upon which a mandatory minimum sentence is
based in the indictment and prove them to a jury.” Harris,
536 U. S., at 581 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Indeed, even with
Harris in place, prosecutors already sometimes charge such facts
and seek to prove them to a jury. See Brief for National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae
26. That is precisely what happened here, where the verdict form
allowed the jury to find whether petitioner had brandished a
firearm yet the jury declined to make such a finding. Ante, at
2.

															     In this context, stare
decisis does not compel adherence to a decision whose
“underpinnings” have been “eroded” by
subsequent developments of constitutional law. Gaudin, 515
U. S., at 521. In rejecting a constitutional challenge to a
state statute that increased a defendant’s minimum sentence
based on judicial factfinding, McMillan relied on a distinction
between “elements” and “sentencing
factors.” 477 U. S., at 86. That distinction was
undermined by Apprendi, where we held that a legislature may not
“remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase
the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is
exposed.” 530 U. S., at 490 (internal quotation marks
omitted).

															     In Harris, we squarely
confronted the question whether “McMillan stands after
Apprendi.” 536 U. S., at 550. Five Members of the Court
recognized that the cases were in fact incompatible. See id., at
569 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);
id., at 572, 583 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (“[O]nly a minority
of the Court embrac[es] the distinction between McMillan and
Apprendi that forms the basis of today’s holding”). In
the control-ling opinion, Justice Breyer nevertheless declined to
apply Apprendi to mandatory minimums because, though he found no
way to distinguish sentencing floors from sentencing ceilings, he
could not “yet accept” Apprendi itself. 536 U. S.,
at 569; see also post, at 1 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment).

															     We have said that a
decision may be “of questionable precedential value”
when “a majority of the Court expressly disagreed with the
rationale of [a] plurality.” Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.
Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 66 (1996) . And Harris has stood on
especially weak ground because its vitality depended upon the
possibility that the Court might retreat from Apprendi. See Harris,
536 U. S., at 569–570 (opinion of Breyer, J.). That has
not happened. Instead, while individual Members of this Court have
continued to question Apprendi, see post, at 1–2 (opinion of
Breyer, J.); post, at 1–2 (Alito, J., dissenting), its rule
has become even more firmly rooted in the Court’s Sixth
Amendment jurisprudence in the decade since Harris. We have applied
Apprendi to strike down mandatory sentencing systems at the state
and federal levels. See Cunningham v. California, 549 U. S.
270 (2007) ; United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005) ;
Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004) . And just last
Term, we recognized that Apprendi’s reasoning extends to
criminal fines. See Southern Union Co. v. United States, 567
U. S. ___ (2012).

															     As a result of these
decisions, Harris has become even more of an outlier. For that
reason, I agree that it is appropriate for the Court to
“overrule Harris and to apply Apprendi’s basic
jury-determination rule to mandatory minimum sentences” in
order to “erase th[is] anomaly” in our case law. Post,
at 2–3 (opinion of Breyer, J.). I do not suggest that every
single factor that supports the overruling of precedent is present
here. Post, at 3, n. * (Alito, J., dissenting). But particularly in
a case where the reliance interests are so minimal, and the
reliance interests of private parties are nonexistent, stare
decisis cannot excuse a refusal to bring “coherence and
consistency,” Patterson, 491 U. S., at 174, to our Sixth
Amendment law.

															     If any doubt remained,
our decision in Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584 (2002) , should
remove it. Ring considered an Apprendi challenge to Arizona’s
capital sentencing system. There, as here, the government urged us
to adhere to a pre-Apprendi decision upholding that scheme. See
Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990) . And there, as here,
we resisted that plea. Ring, 536 U. S., at 609. This case
differs in only one respect: Our post-Apprendi consideration of the
issue in Harris. But for the reasons given, Harris in no way
strengthens the force of stare decisis in this case. With Apprendi
now firmly rooted in our jurisprudence, the Court simply gives
effect to what five Members of the Court recognized in Harris:
“[McMillan] and Apprendi are irreconcilable; our Sixth
Amendment jurisprudence cannot be home to both.” 536
U. S., at 609.

															     Justice Alito is
therefore mistaken when he suggests that the Court overrules Harris
because “there are currently five Justices willing to vote
to” do so. Post, at 3, n. *. No doubt, it would be
illegitimate to overrule a precedent simply because the
Court’s current membership disagrees with it. But that is not
a plausible account of the decision today. The Court overrules
McMillan and Harris because the reasoning of those decisions has
been thoroughly undermined by intervening decisions and because no
significant reliance interests are at stake that might justify
adhering to their result. Likewise, Justice Alito exaggerates when
he suggests that this case creates an important “precedent
about precedent.” Post, at 2. Rarely will a claim for stare
decisis be as weak as it is here, where a constitutional rule of
criminal procedure is at issue that a majority of the Court has
previously recognized is incompatible with our broader
jurisprudence. And finally, Justice Alito’s contention that
Apprendi and Harris stand on equal footing for stare decisis
purposes, post, at 1–2, 3–4, n. *, is simply
inconsistent with our last decade of Sixth Amendment
jurisprudence.

															     Because I believe that
the Court’s decision to apply Apprendi to mandatory minimums
is consistent with stare decisis principles, I join the opinion of
the Court.
