															ADOPTIVE COUPLE, PETITIONERS v. BABY GIRL, a
minor child under the age of fourteen years, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of
south carolina

															[June 25, 2013]

															

															     Justice Scalia,
dissenting.

															     I join Justice
Sotomayor’s dissent except as to one detail. I reject the
conclusion that the Court draws from the words “continued
custody” in 25 U. S. C §1912(f) not because
“literalness may strangle meaning,” see post, at 11,
but because there is no reason that “continued” must
refer to custody in the past rather than custody in the future. I
read the provision as requiring the court to satisfy itself (beyond
a reasonable doubt) not merely that initial or temporary custody is
not “likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage
to the child,” but that continued custody is not likely to do
so. See Webster’s New International Dictionary 577 (2d ed.
1950) (defining “continued” as “[p]rotracted in
time or space, esp. without interruption; constant”). For the
reasons set forth in Justice Sotomayor’s dissent, that
connotation is much more in accord with the rest of the
statute.

															     While I am at it, I
will add one thought. The Court’s opinion, it seems to me,
needlessly demeans the rights of parenthood. It has been the
constant practice of the common law to respect the entitlement of
those who bring a child into the world to raise that child. We do
not inquire whether leaving a child with his parents is “in
the best interest of the child.” It sometimes is not; he
would be better off raised by someone else. But parents have their
rights, no less than children do. This father wants to raise his
daughter, and the statute amply protects his right to do so. There
is no reason in law or policy to dilute that protection.
