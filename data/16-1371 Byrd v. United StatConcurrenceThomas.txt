															TERRENCE BYRD, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit

															[May 14, 2018]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring.

															Although I have serious doubts about the “reasonable expectation of privacy” test from Katz v. United States,

389 U. S. 347, 360–361 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring), I join the Court’s opinion because it correctly navigates our precedents, which no party has asked us to reconsider.  As the Court notes, Byrd also argued that he should prevail under the original meaning of the
 
Fourth Amendment because the police interfered with a property interest that he had in the rental car.  I agree with the Court’s decision not to review this argument in the first instance.  In my view, it would be especially “unwise” to reach that issue, ante, at 7, because the parties fail to adequately address several threshold questions.

															The
 
Fourth Amendment guarantees the people’s right to be secure from unreasonable searches of “their persons, houses, papers, and effects.”  With this language, the
 
Fourth Amendment gives “each person . . . the right to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures in his own person, house, papers, and effects.”  Minnesota v. Carter,

525 U. S. 83, 92 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring).  The issue, then, is whether Byrd can prove that the rental car was his effect.

															That issue seems to turn on at least three threshold questions.  First, what kind of property interest do individuals need before something can be considered “their . . . effec[t]” under the original meaning of the
 
Fourth Amendment?  Second, what body of law determines whether that property interest is present—modern state law, the common law of 1791, or something else?  Third, is the unauthorized use of a rental car illegal or otherwise wrongful under the relevant law, and, if so, does that illegality or wrongfulness affect the
 
Fourth Amendment analysis?

															The parties largely gloss over these questions, but the answers seem vitally important to assessing whether Byrd can claim that the rental car is his effect.  In an appropriate case, I would welcome briefing and argument on these questions.
