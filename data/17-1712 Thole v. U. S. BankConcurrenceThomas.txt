															JAMES J. THOLE, et al., PETITIONERS v. U. S. BANK N. A., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[June 1, 2020]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring.

															I agree with the Court’s opinion, which correctly applies our precedents and concludes that petitioners lack standing.  I also agree that “[c]ourts sometimes make standing law more complicated than it needs to be.”  Ante, at 8.  I write separately to observe that by requiring us to engage with petitioners’ analogies to trust law, our precedents unnecessarily complicate this case.

															The historical restrictions on standing provide a simpler framework.  Article III vests “[t]he judicial Power of the United States” in the federal courts and specifies that it shall extend to enumerated categories of “Cases” and “Controversies.”  §§1, 2.  “To understand the limits that standing imposes on ‘the judicial Power,’ . . . we must ‘refer directly to the traditional, fundamental limitations upon the powers of common-law courts.’ ”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2) (quoting Honig v. Doe,

484 U.S. 305, 340 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting)); see also Muskrat v. United States,

219 U.S. 346, 356–357 (1911) (observing that the “judicial power with the right to determine ‘cases’ and ‘controversies’ ” has long referred to “suit[s] instituted according to the regular course of judicial procedure”).

															“Common-law courts imposed different limitations on a plaintiff ’s right to bring suit depending on the type of right the plaintiff sought to vindicate.”  Spokeo, 578 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  Rights were typically divided into private rights and public rights.  Private rights are those “ ‘belonging to individuals, considered as individuals.’ ”  Ibid. (quoting 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *2); see also Woolhandler & Nelson, Does History Defeat Standing Doctrine? 102 Mich. L. Rev. 689, 693 (2004).  Public rights are “owed ‘to the whole community, considered as a community, in its social aggregate capacity.’ ”  Spokeo, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3) (quoting 4 Blackstone, supra, at *5); see also Woolhandler & Nelson, supra, at 693.

															Petitioners claim violations of private rights under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  “In a suit for the violation of a private right, courts historically presumed that the plaintiff suffered a de facto injury [if] his personal, legal rights [were] invaded.”  Spokeo, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  In this case, however, none of the rights identified by petitioners belong to them.  The fiduciary duties created by ERISA are owed to the plan, not petitioners.  See 29 U. S. C. §§1104(a)(1), 1105(a), 1106(a)(1), 1106(b), 1109(a).  As participants in a defined benefit plan, petitioners have no legal or equitable ownership interest in the plan assets.  See ante, at 4.  There has been no assignment of the plan’s rights by ERISA or any contract.  See ante, at 5.  And petitioners cannot rely on ERISA §502(a).  Although it establishes certain causes of action, it creates no private right.  See §1132(a).

															There is thus no need to analogize petitioners’ complaint to trust law actions, derivative actions, qui tam actions, or anything else.  We need only recognize that the private rights that were allegedly violated do not belong to petitioners under ERISA or any contract.

															Our ERISA precedents have especially complicated the question of standing in this case due to their misinterpretations of the statute.  I continue to object to this Court’s practice of using the common law of trusts as the “starting point” for interpreting ERISA.  Varity Corp. v. Howe,

516 U.S. 489, 497 (1996).  “[I]n ‘every case involving construction of a statute,’ the ‘starting point . . . is the language itself.’ ”  Id., at 528 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,

425 U.S. 185, 197 (1976); ellipsis in original).  This is especially true for ERISA because its “statutory definition of a fiduciary departs from the common law.”  Varity, supra, at 528.  The Court correctly applies Varity here, but in an appropriate case, we should reconsider our reliance on loose analogies in both our standing and ERISA jurisprudence.
