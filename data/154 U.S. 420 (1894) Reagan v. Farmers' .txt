U.S. Supreme CourtReagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 154 U.S. 420 (1894)
Reagan v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company
No. 1170
Submitted April 13, 1894
Decided May 26, 1894
154 U.S. 420

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS
Syllabus 
Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company, ante, 154 U. S. 362, followed.

															The case is stated in the opinion.

															MR. JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the Court.

															This case is controlled by the opinions in the four preceding cases.

															There are one or two differences of fact, but nothing affecting the merits of the controversy.  The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad Company was incorporated by the State of Texas, but a part of its line was constructed through the Indian Territory under authority of an act of Congress.  The figures as to earnings, etc., are also different, but they tend to the same result, as to the reasonableness of the rates.

															A like decree will be entered in this as in the former cases.
