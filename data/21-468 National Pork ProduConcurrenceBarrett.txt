															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–468

															_________________

															NATIONAL PORK PRODUCERS COUNCIL, et al.,
PETITIONERS v. KAREN ROSS, in her official capacity as
SECRETARY OF THE CALI- FORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD & AGRICULTURE,
et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 11, 2023]

															

															Justice Barrett, concurring in part.

															A state law that burdens interstate commerce in
clear excess of its putative local benefits flunks Pike
balancing. Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S.
137, 142 (1970). In most cases, Pike’s
“general rule” reflects a commonsense principle: Where
there’s smoke, there’s fire. Ibid. Under our
dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, one State may not
discriminate against another’s producers or consumers. A law
whose burdens fall incommensurately and inexplicably on
out-of-state interests may be doing just that.

															But to weigh benefits and burdens, it is
axiomatic that both must be judicially cognizable and comparable.
See Department of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, 553 U.S.
328, 354–355 (2008). I agree with Justice Gorsuch that
the benefits and burdens of Proposition 12 are incommensurable.
California’s interest in eliminating allegedly inhumane
products from its markets cannot be weighed on a scale opposite
dollars and cents—at least not without second-guessing the
moral judgments of California voters or making the kind of policy
decisions reserved for politicians. Ante, at 18–21;
Davis, 553 U. S., at 360 (Scalia, J., concurring in
part). None of our Pike precedents requires us to attempt
such a feat.

															That said, I disagree with my colleagues who
would hold that petitioners have failed to allege a substantial
burden on interstate commerce. Ante, at 21–25;
ante, at 3 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part). The
complaint plausibly alleges that Proposition 12’s costs are
pervasive, burdensome, and will be felt primarily (but not
exclusively) outside California. See post, at 6–7
(Roberts, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
For this reason, I do not join Part IV–C of Justice
Gorsuch’s opinion. If the burdens and benefits were capable
of judicial balancing, I would permit petitioners to proceed with
their Pike claim.
