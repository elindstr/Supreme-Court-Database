															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															MARK A. CHRISTESON v. DON ROPER, WARDEN

															on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the eighth circuit

															No. 14â€“6873.â€ƒDecided
January 20, 2015

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
dissenting.

															I would not reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in this
case without briefing and argument. As the Court acknowledges,
petitioner cannot obtain review of the merits of his federal habeas
claims without showing that the applicable statute of limitations
should have been equitably tolled, ante, at 2, and the
availability of equit-able tolling in cases governed by the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) is a
question of great importance.

															AEDPA sought to ameliorate the lengthy delay that had often
characterized federal habeas proceedings in the past.[1]* See Woodford v. Garceau,538 U. S.
202,206 (2003) (â€œCongress enacted AEDPA to
reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal
sentences, particularly in capital casesâ€). AEDPA thus
imposed a strict 1-year time limit for filing a federal habeas
petition.28 U. S. C. Â§2244(d). If this 1-year period
were equitably tolled whenever a habeas
petitionerâ€™s attorney missed the deadline and
thus rendered ineffective assistance, the 1-year period would be of
little value, and the days of seemingly interminable federal habeas
review would return. In Holland, the Court held that the
AEDPA statute of limitations may be equitably
tolledâ€”but only under quite extraordinary
circumstances. Holland v. Florida, 560 U. S.
631â€“652 (2010). Any expansion or further
delineation of such circumstances should not be undertaken without
the careful consideration that is possible only after the normal
procedure of full briefing and argument.

															The Court believes that briefing and argument are not necessary
in this case, and my understanding of the
Courtâ€™s decision is that it expresses no view
whatsoever on the question whether petitioner may ultimately be
entitled to equitable tolling. I understand the Court to hold only
that conflict-free substitute counsel should have been appointed
for the purposes of investigating the facts re-lated to the issue
of equitable tolling and presenting whatever argument can be
mounted in support of a request for that relief.

															Based on the present record, it is not clear that this case
involves anything other than an error, albeit a serious one, on the
part of the attorneys who represented petitioner at the time when
his federal habeas petition was due to be filed. According to those
attorneys, they miscalculated the due date and as a result filed
the petition after the time had run. They met with petitioner to
discuss the habeas petition prior to the date on which they say
they thought the petition was due but after the date on which it
was actually due. These facts show nothing more than attorney error
and thus fall short of establishing the kind of abandonment that is
needed for equitable tolling under our precedent. See id.,
at 651â€“652. I do not understand the
Courtâ€™s opinion to hold otherwise.

															Because of the close relationship between the question that the
Court decides (the propriety of the District
Courtâ€™s refusal to appoint substitute counsel)
and the question of petitionerâ€™s entitlement to
equitable tolling, I think that plenary review would have been more
appropriate in this case. I write separately to emphasize that the
Courtâ€™s summary disposition does not address
that issue.
