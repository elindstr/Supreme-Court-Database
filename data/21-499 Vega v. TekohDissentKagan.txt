															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															CARLOS VEGA, PETITIONER v. TERENCE B. TEKOH

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 23, 2022]

															

															Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor join, dissenting.

															The Court’s decision in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), affords well-known protections to suspects who are interrogated by police while in custody.  Those protections derive from the Constitution: Dickerson v. United States tells us in no uncertain terms that Miranda is a “constitutional rule.”  530 U.S. 428, 444 (2000).  And that rule grants a corresponding right: If police fail to provide the Miranda warnings to a suspect before interrogating him, then he is generally entitled to have any resulting confession excluded from his trial.  See 384 U. S., at 478–479.  From those facts, only one conclusion can follow—that Miranda’s protections are a “right[ ]” “secured by the Constitution” under the federal civil rights statute.  Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983.  Yet the Court today says otherwise.  It holds that Miranda is not a constitutional right enforceable through a §1983 suit.  And so it prevents individuals from obtaining any redress when police violate their rights under Miranda.  I respectfully dissent.

															Miranda responded to problems stemming from the interrogation of suspects “incommunicado” and “in a police-dominated atmosphere.”  Miranda, 384 U. S., at 445.  In such an environment, Miranda said, there are “pressures” which may “compel [a suspect] to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.”  Id., at 467.  And so Miranda found a “necessity for procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his” Fifth Amendment privilege “not to be compelled to incriminate himself.”  Id., at 439. Miranda set out protocols (including the now-familiar warnings) that would safeguard the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.  See id., at 478–479.  And Miranda held that if police failed to follow those requirements (without substituting equally effective ones), the prosecution could not use at trial a statement obtained from the interrogation.  See id., at 479.

															The question in this case is whether Miranda’s protections are a “right[ ]” that is “secured by the Constitution” within the meaning of §1983.  If the answer is yes, then a person may sue a state actor who deprives him of the right.  In past cases, the Court has given a broad construction to §1983’s broad language.  See, e.g., Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U.S. 439, 443 (1991).  Under §1983 (as elsewhere), a “right[ ]” is anything that creates specific “obligations binding on [a] governmental unit” that an individual may ask the judiciary to enforce.  Id., at 449; see id., at 447, and n. 7.  And the phrase “secured by the Constitution” also has a capacious meaning.  It refers to any right that is “protect[ed] or ma[de] certain” by the country’s foundational charter.  Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U.S. 496, 527 (1939) (opinion of Stone, J.) (internal quotation marks omitted).

															Begin with whether Miranda is “secured by the Constitution.”  We know that it is, because the Court’s decision in Dickerson says so.  Dickerson tells us again and again that Miranda is a “constitutional rule.”  530 U. S., at 444.  It is a “constitutional decision” that sets forth “ ‘concrete constitutional guidelines.’ ”  Id., at 432, 435 (quoting Miranda, 384 U. S., at 442).  Miranda “is constitutionally based”; or again, it has a “constitutional basis.”  530 U. S., at 439, n. 3, 440.  It is “of constitutional origin”; it has “constitutional underpinnings.”  Id., at 439, n. 3, 440, n. 5.  And—one more—Miranda sets a “constitutional minimum.”  530 U. S., at 442.  Over and over, Dickerson labels Miranda a rule stemming from the Constitution.

															Dickerson also makes plain that Miranda has all the substance of a constitutional rule—including that it cannot be “abrogate[d]” by any “legislation.”  Miranda, 384 U. S., at 491; see Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 437.  In Dickerson, the Court considered a federal statute whose obvious purpose was to override Miranda.  Dickerson held that Miranda is a “constitutional decision” that cannot be “overruled by” any “Act of Congress.”  530 U. S., at 432.  To be sure, Congress may devise “legislative solutions that differ[ ] from the prescribed Miranda warnings,” but only if those solutions are “ ‘at least as effective.’ ”  Id., at 440 (quoting Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467).  Dickerson therefore instructs (as noted above) that Miranda sets a “constitutional minimum.”  530 U. S., at 442.  No statute may provide lesser protection than that baseline.[1]*

															And Dickerson makes clear that the constitutional substance of Miranda does not end there.  Rules arising from “the United States Constitution” are applicable in state-court proceedings, but non-constitutional rules are not.  See 530 U. S., at 438 (explaining that the Court “do[es] not hold a supervisory power over the courts of the several States”).  Too, constitutional rules are enforceable in federal-court habeas proceedings, where a prisoner is entitled to claim he “is in custody in violation of the Constitution.”  28 U. S. C. §2254(a).  Miranda checks both boxes.  The Court has “consistently applied Miranda’s rule to prosecutions arising in state courts.”  Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 438.  And prisoners may claim Miranda violations in federal-court habeas proceedings.  See 530 U. S., at 439, n. 3; Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 107, n. 5 (1995).  So Dickerson is unequivocal: Miranda is set in constitutional stone.

															Miranda’s constitutional rule gives suspects a correlative “right[ ].”  §1983.  Under Miranda, a suspect typically has a right to be tried without the prosecutor using his un- Mirandized statement. And we know how that right operates in the real world.  Suppose a defendant standing trial was able to show the court that he gave an un-Mirandized confession during a custodial interrogation.  The court would have no choice but to exclude it from the prosecutor’s case.  As one judge below put it: “Miranda indisputably creates individual legal rights that are judicially enforceable.  (Any prosecutor who doubts this can try to introduce an un-Mirandized confession and then watch what happens.)”  Tekoh v. County of Los Angeles, 997 F.3d 1260, 1263 (CA9 2021) (Miller, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).

															The majority basically agrees with everything I’ve just explained.  It concurs that, per Dickerson, Miranda “adopted a ‘constitutional rule.’ ”  Ante, at 11 (quoting Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 439); see ante, at 12.  How could it not?  That Miranda is a constitutional rule is what Dickerson said (and said and said).  The majority also agrees that Miranda “directed that statements obtained in violation of [its] rules may not be used by the prosecution in its case-in-chief ”—which is simply another way of saying that Miranda grants suspects a right to the exclusion of those statements from the prosecutor’s case.  Ante, at 5.

															So how does the majority hold that a violation of Miranda is not a “deprivation of [a] right[ ]” “secured by the Constitution”?  §1983.  How does it agree with my premises, but not my conclusion?  The majority’s argument is that “a violation of Miranda does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Constitution,” because Miranda’s rules are “prophylactic.”  Ante, at 13. The idea is that the Fifth Amendment prohibits the use only of statements obtained by compulsion, whereas Miranda excludes non-compelled statements too.  See ante, at 4–5. That is why, the majority says, the Court has been able to recognize exceptions permitting certain uses of un-Mirandized statements at trial (when it could not do so for compelled statements).  See ante, at 7–9.  

															But none of that helps the majority’s case.  Let’s assume, as the majority says, that Miranda extends beyond—in order to safeguard—the Fifth Amendment’s core guarantee.  Still, Miranda is enforceable through §1983.  It remains a constitutional rule, as Dickerson held (and the majority agrees).  And it grants the defendant a legally enforceable entitlement—in a word, a right—to have his confession excluded.  So, to refer back to the language of §1983, Miranda grants a “right[ ]” “secured by the Constitution.”  Whether that right to have evidence excluded safeguards a yet deeper constitutional commitment makes no difference to §1983.  The majority has no response to that point—except to repeat what our argument assumes already.  See ante, at 14, n. 6 (describing Miranda as prophylactic). 

															Compare the majority’s holding today to a prior decision, in which the Court “rejected [an] attempt[ ] to limit the types of constitutional rights that are encompassed within ” §1983.  Dennis, 498 U. S., at 445.  There, the Court held that a plaintiff could sue under §1983 for a violation of the so-called dormant Commerce Clause, which safeguards interstate commerce.  To the Court, it did not matter that the Commerce Clause might be viewed as “merely allocat[ing] power between the Federal and State Governments” over interstate commerce, rather than as “confer[ring] ‘rights.’ ”  Id., at 447.  Nor did it matter that the dormant Commerce Clause’s protection is only “implied” by the constitutional text.  Ibid., n. 7.  The dormant Commerce Clause, the Court said, still provides a “right”—in the “ordinary” sense of being “ ‘[a] legally enforceable claim of one person against another.’ ”  Ibid. (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 1324 (6th ed. 1990)).  That describes Miranda to a tee.  And if a right implied from Congress’s constitutional authority over interstate commerce is enforceable under §1983, how could it be that Miranda—which the Court has found necessary to safeguard the personal protections of the Fifth Amendment—is not also enforceable?  The majority again has no answer. 

															*  *  *

															Today, the Court strips individuals of the ability to seek a remedy for violations of the right recognized in Miranda.  The majority observes that defendants may still seek “the suppression at trial of statements obtained” in violation of Miranda’s procedures.  Ante, at 14–15. But sometimes, such a statement will not be suppressed.  And sometimes, as a result, a defendant will be wrongly convicted and spend years in prison.  He may succeed, on appeal or in habeas, in getting the conviction reversed.  But then, what remedy does he have for all the harm he has suffered?  The point of §1983 is to provide such redress—because a remedy “is a vital component of any scheme for vindicating cherished constitutional guarantees.”  Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 639 (1980).  The majority here, as elsewhere, injures the right by denying the remedy.  See, e.g., Egbert v. Boule, 596 U. S. ___ (2022).  I respectfully dissent.

*Other constitutional rules, like Miranda, leave room for States to experiment with procedures, so long as the procedures satisfy the constitutionally mandated baseline.  See County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 58 (1991) (States may adopt different procedures for providing probable-cause determinations for persons arrested without a warrant, so long as those determinations are made promptly); Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 276–277 (2000) (States may adopt different procedures to ensure effective appellate review for indigent defendants’ claims, “so long as [the State] reasonably ensures that an indigent’s appeal will be resolved in a way that is related to the merit of that appeal”).
