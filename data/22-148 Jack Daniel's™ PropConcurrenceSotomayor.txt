															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 22–148

															_________________

															JACK DANIEL’S PROPERTIES, INC.,
PETITIONER v. VIP PRODUCTS LLC

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 8, 2023]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Alito
joins, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full. I
write separately to emphasize that in the context of parodies and
potentially other uses implicating First Amendment concerns, courts
should treat the results of surveys with particular caution. As
petitioner did here, plaintiffs in trademark infringement cases
often commission surveys that purport to show that consumers are
likely to be confused by an allegedly infringing product. Like any
other evidence, surveys should be understood as merely one piece of
the multifaceted likelihood of confusion analysis. See,
e.g., Uncommon, LLC v. Spigen, Inc., 926 F.3d
409, 425 (CA7 2019). Courts should also carefully assess the
methodology and representativeness of surveys, as many lower courts
already do. See, e.g., Water Pik, Inc. v.
Med-Systems, Inc., 726 F.3d 1136, 1144–1150
(CA10 2013); Starbucks Corp. v. Wolfe’s Borough
Coffee, Inc., 588 F.3d 97, 117 (CA2 2009).

															When an alleged trademark infringement involves
a parody, however, there is particular risk in giving uncritical or
undue weight to surveys. Survey answers may reflect a mistaken
belief among some survey respondents that all parodies require
permission from the owner of the parodied mark. Some of the answers
to the survey in this case illustrate this potential. See App.
81–82, n. 25 (“ ‘I’m sure the dog
toy company that made this toy had to get [Jack Daniel’s]
permission and legal rights to essentially copy the[ir] product in
dog toy form’ ”); ibid.
(“ ‘The bottle is mimicked after the Jack Daniel
BBQ sauce. So they would hold the patent therefore you would have
to ask permission to use the image’ ”); see also
Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Balducci Publications,

28 F.3d 769, 772–773, 775 (CA8 1994) (describing a
similar situation). Plaintiffs can point to this misunderstanding
of the legal framework as evidence of consumer confusion. Cleverly
designed surveys could also prompt such confusion by making
consumers think about complex legal questions around permission
that would not have arisen organically out in the world.

															Allowing such survey results to drive the
infringement analysis would risk silencing a great many parodies,
even ones that by other metrics are unlikely to result in the
confusion about sourcing that is the core concern of the Lanham
Act. See ante, at 4, 10, 14. Well-heeled brands with the
resources to commission surveys would be handed an effective veto
over mockery. After all, “[n]o one likes to be the butt of a
joke, not even a trademark.” 6 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and
Unfair Competition §31:153 (5th ed. 2023). This would upset
the Lanham Act’s careful balancing of “the needs of
merchants for identification as the provider of goods with the
needs of society for free communication and discussion.” P.
Leval, Trademark: Champion of Free Speech, 27 Colum. J. L.
& Arts 187, 210 (2004). Courts should thus ensure surveys do
not completely displace other likelihood-of-confusion factors,
which may more accurately track the experiences of actual consumers
in the marketplace. Courts should also be attentive to ways in
which surveys may artificially prompt such confusion about the law
or fail to sufficiently control for it.
