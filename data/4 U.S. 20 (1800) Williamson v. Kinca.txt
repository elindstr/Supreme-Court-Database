U.S. Supreme Court
Williamson v. Kincaid, 4 U.S. 4 Dall.
20 20 (1800)
Williamson v. Kincaid
4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 20
ERROR TO THE
CIRCUIT
COURT OF GEORGIA
Syllabus

															Where the value of the matter in dispute did not appear upon the
record, the Court allowed affidavits to prove the same to be taken
on notice to the opposite party, the writ of error not to be a
supersedeas.

															It appeared from the record that

															"Marian Kincaid of Great Britain, widow, demanded against John
G. Williamson the one-third of 300 acres of land, &c., in
Chatham County as dower. That the tenant pleaded 1st, the Act of
Georgia passed 1 March, 1778, attainting G. Kincaid (the
demandant's late husband) forfeiting his estate, and vesting it in
Georgia, without office; 2d, the Act of 4 May, 1782, banishing G.
Kincaid and confiscating his estate; 3d, the appropriation and sale
of the lands in question by virtue of the said attainder and
confiscation before 3 September, 1783 (the date of the definitive
treaty of peace) and before G. Kincaid's death; 4th, the alienage
of the demandant (who was resident abroad on 4 July, 1776, and ever
since) and therefore incapable of holding lands in Georgia. That
the demandant replied that she and her husband were inhabitants of
Georgia on the 19th of April 1775, then under the dominion of Great
Britain; that her husband continued a subject of Great Britain and
never owed allegiance to Georgia, nor was ever convicted by any
lawful authority of any crimes against the state. That the tenant
demurred to the replication, the demandant joined in demurrer, and
judgment was pronounced by the circuit court (composed of
WASHINGTON, Justice, and CLAY, district judge) for the
demandant."

															On this judgment the writ of error was brought, and the
following errors assigned.

															1. The general errors.

															2. The attainder of G. Kincaid and the forfeiture and sale of
his estate; so no right to dower accrued; and no land out of which
it could be enjoyed.

															3. The alienage of the widow on the 4th of July 1776 and ever
since, by which she was incapable to take and hold real estate in
Georgia.

															The principal question (whether an alien, British subject, was
entitled under the treaty of peace to claim and hold lands in

															Page 4 U. S. 21

															dower) was not discussed, as the judgment was reversed for want
of a sufficient description of the parties to the suit, on the
authority of Bingham v.
Cabot, 3 U. S. 382, and
Turner v. Bank of North
America, 4 U. S. 8. But an
important point of practice was previously settled relative to the
mode of ascertaining the value of the matter in dispute in actions
like the present.

															For the plaintiff in error, it was admitted in answer to an
objection that the value of the matter in dispute did not appear
upon the record, but it was urged that from the nature of the
subject, the demand of the plaintiff could not ascertain it, nor
from the nature of the suit (like a case of ejectment, where
damages are only given for the ouster) could it be fixed by the
finding of a jury, on the judgment of the court. 3 Bl.Com. 35-36.
As therefore there was no act of Congress nor any rule of the court
prescribing a mode to ascertain in such cases the value in dispute,
that the party may have the benefit of a writ of error, it was
proposed to continue the cause to afford an opportunity to satisfy
the court by affidavits of the actual value of the property.

															By the Court:

															Be it so. Let the value of the matter in dispute be ascertained
by affidavits, to be taken on ten days' notice to the demandant or
her counsel in Georgia. But consequently the writ of error is not
to be a supersedeas.
