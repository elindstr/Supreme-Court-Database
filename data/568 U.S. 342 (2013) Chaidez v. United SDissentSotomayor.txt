															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															ROSELVA CHAIDEZ, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[February 20, 2013]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg
joins, dissenting.

															The Court holds today that Padilla v.
Kentucky, 559 U. S. ___ (2010), announced a
“new” rule within the meaning of Teague v.
Lane, 489 U.S.
288, 301 (1989), and so does not apply to convictions that
became final before its announcement. That is wrong, because
Padilla did nothing more than apply the existing rule of
Strickland v. Washington, 466
U.S. 668 (1984), in a new setting, the same way the Court has
done repeatedly in the past: by surveying the relevant professional
norms and conclud- ing that they unequivocally required attorneys
to provide advice about the immigration consequences of a guilty
plea. Because Padilla fell squarely within the metes and
bounds established by Strickland, I respectfully
dissent.

															I

															A

															The majority correctly sets forth the
governing legal principles under Teague and
Strickland. Ante, at 4–5. The
Teague inquiry turns centrally on the “nature of the
rule” in question, and for that reason, “[w]here the
beginning point is a rule of . . . general application, . . .
it will be the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that
it forges a new rule.” Wright v. West,
505 U.S.
277, 308–309 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in
judgment); see ante, at 4–5. The majority makes the
important observation that “when all we do is apply a
general standard to the kind of factual circumstances it was meant
to address, we will rarely state a new rule.” Ibid. It
makes sense, then, that “garden-variety applications of . . .
Strickland . . . do not produce new rules.”
Ante, at 5.

															In Strickland, we did not provide a
comprehensive def- inition of deficient performance, and instead
held that “[t]he proper measure of attorney performance
remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional
norms.” 466 U. S., at 688. Strickland’s
reasonableness prong therefore takes its content from the standards
by which lawyers judge their professional obligations,
ibid., and those standards are subject to change. That is
why, despite the many different settings in which it has been
applied, we have never found that an application of
Strickland resulted in a new rule.[1]

															Significantly, we have previously found that
applications of Strickland to new factual scenarios are not
barred under 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) of the
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). Section
2254(d)(1) precludes habeas relief unless a state court decision
violates “clearly established Federal law,” which, as
relevant here, largely overlaps with the inquiry under
Teague of whether a decision was “dictated by
precedent.” 489 U. S., at 301 (plurality
opinion).[2] In Wiggins
v. Smith, 539
U.S. 510, 522 (2003), for example, we found that
Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S.
362 (2000), “made no new law” when it held that
Strickland extended to an attorney’s responsibility to
conduct a background investigation in a capital case. Rather, we
explained that “in referring to the ABA Standards for
Criminal Justice as guides, [Williams] applied the same
‘clearly established’ precedent of Strickland we
apply today.” 539 U. S., at 522. Similarly, in
Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___, ___,
___–___ (2012) (slip op., at 6, 14–16), we rejected the
argument advanced by the Solicitor General that the Sixth Amendment
did not extend to advice about a plea offer because it did not
impact the fairness of the trial. Instead, we simply held that
Strickland applied to this form of attorney misconduct.

															In short, where we merely apply
Strickland in a way that corresponds to an evolution in
professional norms, we make no new law.

															B

															Contrary to the majority’s
reconstruction, Padilla is built squarely on the foundation
laid out by Strickland. Padilla relied upon
controlling precedent. It began by reciting the basic rule that
“[u]nder Strickland, we first determine whether
counsel’s representation ‘fell below an objective
standard of reasonableness.’ ” Padilla, 559
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Strickland, 466
U. S., at 688). We recognized that “[t]he first
prong—constitutional deficiency—is necessarily linked
to the practice and expectations of the legal community:
‘[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains
reasonableness under pre- vailing professional
norms.’ ” Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 9) (quoting Strickland, 466 U. S., at
688).

															We therefore examined the substantial changes in
fed- eral immigration law that provided the backdrop to the
relevant professional standards. Padilla, 559 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 2–6). Pursuant to the Immigration Act of
1917, 39Stat. 889–890, a judge could recommend that a
defendant who had committed a deportable offense not be removed
from the country. Congress entirely eliminated this procedure in
1990. 104Stat. 5050. Then the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), 110Stat.
3009–596, abolished the Attor- ney General’s authority
to grant discretionary relief from removal for all but a small
number of offenses. Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 6). These changes in immigration law meant that for a
noncitizen who committed a removable offense, “removal [had
become] practically inevitable.” Ibid.

															In parallel with these developments, the
standards of professional responsibility relating to immigration
had become more demanding. “For at least the past 15
years,” we observed in Padilla, “professional
norms have gener- ally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide
advice on the deportation consequences of a client’s
plea.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15). Citing an array
of practice guides and professional responsibility manuals, we
noted that “[t]he weight of prevailing professional norms
supports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the
risk of deportation.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).
Indeed, “authorities of every stripe—including the
American Bar Association, criminal defense and public defender
organizations, authoritative treatises, and state and city bar
publications—universally require defense attorneys to advise
as to the risk of deportation consequences for non-citizen
clients.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal
quotation marks omitted).

															We drew further support for our conclusion that
professional standards required advice about deportation
consequences from our decision in INS v. St. Cyr,
533 U.S.
289 (2001). See Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip
op., at 10–11) (citing St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at
323). In St. Cyr, we had explained that the availability of
discretionary relief from removal was critical to a
noncitizen’s decision to accept a plea offer, and expected
counsel to follow the instructions of “numerous practice
guides,” such as the ABA’s Standards for Criminal
Justice, to inform themselves of the possible immigration
consequences of a plea. Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 11) (citing St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at 323,
n. 50); see id., at 322, n. 48. And we there found that many
States already required that a trial judge advise defendants of the
same. Ibid. St. Cyr thus “recognized that
‘preserving the client’s right to remain in the United
States may be more important to the client than any potential jail
sentence.’ ” Padilla, 559 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 10) (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U. S., at
322).

															Our application of Strickland in
Padilla followed naturally from these earlier observations
about changes in immigration law and the accompanying evolution of
professional norms. When we decided St. Cyr and
Padilla, nothing about Strickland’s substance
or applicability had changed. The only difference from prior law
was that the underlying professional norms had changed such that
counsel’s failure to give this advice now amounted to
constitutionally deficient performance.[3] Both before Padilla and after, counsel was
obligated to follow the relevant professional norms. It was only
because those norms reflected changes in immigration law that
Padilla reached the result it did, not because the Sixth
Amendment right had changed at all.

															II

															A

															Accepting that routine applications of
Strickland do not result in new rules, the majority
nevertheless holds that Padilla went a step further. In its
view, Padilla “ ‘br[oke] new
ground’ ” by addressing the threshold question of
whether advice about deportation is a collateral consequence of a
criminal conviction that falls within the scope of the Sixth
Amendment. Ante, at 9–10. But that is wrong, because
Padilla declined to embrace the very distinction between
collateral and direct consequences of a criminal conviction that
the majority says it did. In fact, the Court stated very clearly
that it found the distinction irrelevant for the purposes of
determining a defense lawyer’s obligation to provide advice
about the immigration consequences of a plea. 559 U. S., at
___, n. 8 (slip op., at 7, n. 8). We asserted that we had
“never applied a dis- tinction between direct and collateral
consequences to define the scope of constitutionally
‘reasonable professional assistance’ required under
Strickland,” and concluded that “[w]hether that
distinction is appropriate is a question we need not
consider in this case.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at
8) (emphasis added). The distinction was “ill suited”
to the task at hand, we explained, because deportation has a
“close connection to the criminal process,” and is
“uniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a
collateral consequence.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at
8–9). Indeed, “[o]ur law ha[d] enmeshed criminal
convictions and the penalty of de- portation for nearly a
century,” and we had “long recognized” that
deportation is “particularly severe.” Id., at
___ (slip op., at 8).[4]

															At bottom, then, the majority’s argument
hinges upon a distinction the Court has never embraced and that
Padilla found irrelevant to the issue it ultimately decided.
Without this revision to our recent decisional history, the
majority’s analysis unravels.

															B

															The majority finds that the “legal
landscape,” Graham v. Collins, 506 U.S.
461, 468 (1993), before Padilla was nearly uniform in
its rejection of Strickland’s application to the
deportation consequences of a plea. Ante, at 7–10. It
concludes that the lower courts were generally in agreement that
the Sixth Amendment did not require attorneys to inform clients of
the collateral consequences of a plea, and that this weighs heavily
in favor of finding that Padilla announced a new rule.
Ante, at 7–8, nn. 7, 8. But the majority’s
discussion of these precedents operates at too high a level of
generality and fails to account for the development of professional
standards over time. St. Cyr noted the importance of
advising clients about immigration consequences was of recent
vintage, indeed more re- cent than some of the cases the majority
cites. See 533 U. S., at 322–323. The Court relies upon
decisions issued over a period that spans more than 30 years. See
ante, at 7–8, nn. 7, 8. Nearly half of them
(17) were decided before the enactment of IIRIRA. See ibid.
And all but two of the Federal Court of Appeals cases were decided
before St. Cyr. See ante, at 7–8, nn. 7, 8.
These earlier decisions show nothing more than that the underlying
professional norms had not yet evolved to require attorneys to
provide advice about deportation consequences.

															Cases from the period following IIRIRA and
St. Cyr undermine the majority’s generalizations about
the state of the law before Padilla. Deportation had long
been un- derstood by lower courts to present “the most
difficult” penalty to classify as either a collateral or
direct consequence. United States v. Russell, 686
F.2d 35, 38 (CADC 1982); cf. Janvier v. United
States, 793 F.2d 449, 455 (CA2 1986) (holding that
Strickland applied to advice about a judicial recommendation
against deportation). Eventually, and in parallel with changes in
federal immigration law and the corresponding professional norms,
the lower courts had acknowledged an important qualification to the
collateral consequences rule. After the passage of IIRIRA and this
Court’s decision in St. Cyr, many courts concluded
that a lawyer’s affirmative misstatements about the
immigration consequences of a guilty plea can constitute deficient
performance under Strickland. Indeed, each Federal Court of
Appeals to address the question after St. Cyr so held. See
United States v. Couto, 
311 F.3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); United States v.
Kwan, 
407 F.3d 1005, 1015 (CA9 2005); cf. Downs-Morgan v.
United States, 765 F.2d 1534, 1540–1541 (CA11
1985).[5] State-court decisions
from this period were in accord and relied upon similar
reasoning.[6]

															These decisions created an important exception
to the collateral/direct consequences distinction. They also
foreshadowed the Court’s reasoning in Padilla by
basing their analysis of the relevant professional norms on the
special nature of deportation, the ABA standards governing
immigration practice, and the Court’s assessment of those
standards in St Cyr. See Kwan, 407 F. 3d, at
1016 (“That counsel may have misled [the defendant] out of
ignorance is no excuse. It is a basic rule of professional conduct
that a lawyer must . . . [remain] abreast of changes in
the law and its practice. . . . Counsel’s
performance . . . fell be- low the [ABA]’s ethical
standard for criminal defense at- torneys with respect to
immigration consequences. The Supreme Court noted this standard in
[St. Cyr]”); Couto, 311 F. 3d, at
187–191 (citing St. Cyr and the relevant ABA
standards, and concluding that “recent Supreme Court
authority supports [a] broader view of attorney
responsibility” that encompasses affirmative
misrepresentations about deportation consequences); see also
Downs-Morgan, 765 F. 2d, at 1541 (“[D]eportation
and exclusion [are] harsh consequences”).

															The majority believes that these decisions did
not meaningfully alter the state of the law in the lower courts
before Padilla, because they merely applied the age-old
principle that a lawyer may not affirmatively mislead a client.
Ante, at 12–13. But, as explained, the reasoning of
these cases renders that characterization at best incomplete. See,
e.g., Kwan, 407 F. 3d, at 1016. While these
lower court precedents are consistent with the general principle
that attorneys should not mislead clients by providing incorrect
advice, they did not rest primarily on that rule. Rather, they
recognized the significant changes in professional norms that
predated Padilla and that we had noted in St. Cyr. As
a consequence, the “wall between direct and collateral
consequences” that the lower courts had erected, ante,
at 9, had already been dealt a serious blow by the time the Court
decided Padilla.

															As the majority points out, these
misrepresentation cases stopped short of imposing an affirmative
obligation on lawyers to consult with clients about the
consequences of deportation. Ante, at 12–13. But the
majority places too much emphasis on the absence of lower court
authority finding that an attorney’s omissions with respect
to deportation resulted in ineffective assistance. The distinction
between omissions and affirmative misrepresentations on which these
lower court cases depended cannot be reconciled with
Strickland. In Padilla itself, we rejected the
Solicitor General’s suggestion that Strickland should
apply to advice about the immigration consequences of a plea only
in cases where defense counsel makes an affirmative misstatement.
Padilla, 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). We did so
because we found that Strickland was incompatible with the
distinction between an obligation to give advice and a prohibition
on affirmative misstatements. 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
12–13) (citing Strickland, 466 U. S., at 690).
Strickland made clear that its standard of attorney
performance applied to both “acts” and
“omissions,” and that a rule limiting the performance
inquiry to one or the other was too narrow. 466 U. S., at 690.
Thus, the distinction between misrepresentations and omissions, on
which the majority relies in classifying lower court precedent,
implies a categorical rule that is inconsistent with
Strickland’s requirement of a case-by-case assessment
of an attorney’s performance.[7] Id., at 688–689; see, e.g.,
Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528
U.S. 470, 479 (2000). In short, that some courts have
differentiated between misleading by silence and affirmative
misrep- resentation hardly establishes the rationality of the
distinction. Notably, the Court offers no reasoned basis for
believing that such a distinction can be extracted from
Strickland.

															To be sure, lower courts did continue to apply
the distinction between collateral and direct consequences after
St. Cyr. See ante, at 13–14; see, e.g.,
Broomes v. Ashcroft, 
358 F.3d 1251, 1256–1257 (CA10 2004). Even so, and even
assuming the misrepresentation cases did not call the distinction
into question, the existence of these lower court decisions is not
dispositive. “[T]he standard for determining when a case
establishes a new rule is ‘objective,’ and the mere
existence of conflicting authority does not necessarily mean a rule
is new.” Wright, 505 U. S., at 304
(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (citing
Stringer v. Black, 503 U.S.
222, 237 (1992)); see Graham v. Collins,
506 U.S.
461, 506 (1993) (Souter, J., dissenting).

															Where the application of Strickland was
straightforward, rooted in 15 years of professional standards and
the Court’s prior St. Cyr decision, there is no reason
to put these lower court cases, many from more than a decade
earlier, ahead of this Court’s simple and clear reasoning in
Padilla. Nevertheless, the majority reaches the paradoxical
conclusion that by declining to apply a collateral-consequence
doctrine the Court had never adopted, Padilla announced a
new rule.

															III

															What truly appears to drive the
majority’s analysis is its sense that Padilla
occasioned a serious disruption in lower court decisional
reasoning. See, e.g., ante, at 9–10 (“If that
does not count as ‘break[ing] new ground’ . . . we are
hard pressed to know what would” (quoting Teague, 489
U. S., at 301)). The concurring and dissenting opinions in
Padilla similarly reflected the impression that it was a
significant and destabilizing decision. See 559 U. S., at ___
(Alito, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3); id.,
at ___ (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5) (describing the
majority opinion as a “sledge hammer”); ante, at
8–9, n. 10. But the fact that a decision was perceived as
momentous or consequential, particularly by those who disagreed
with it, does not control in the Teague analysis. Faithfully
applying the Teague rule depends instead on an examination
of this Court’s reasoning and an objective assessment of the
precedent at issue. Stringer, 503 U. S., at 237. In
Padilla, we did nothing more than apply Strickland.
By holding to the contrary, today’s decision deprives
defendants of the fundamental protection of Strickland,
which requires that lawyers comply with professional norms with
respect to any advice they provide to clients.

															*  *  *

															Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of
the Seventh Circuit and hold that Padilla applies
retroactively on collateral review to convictions that became final
before its announcement. With respect, I dissent.

 See, e.g., Lafler
v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2012)
(incorrect advice leading to a plea offer’s rejection);
Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S.
374 (2005) (failure to investigate evidence the prosecution
intended to use to prove an aggravating circumstance in a capital
case); Wiggins v. Smith, 539
U.S. 510 (2003) (failure to investigate a defendant’s
social history in a capital case); Roe v.

background for the purposes of mitigation evidence in a capital
case); Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S.

 AEDPA of course differs
from the Teague rule in other important respects. See,
e.g., Greene v. Fisher, 565 U. S. ___,
___ (2011) (slip op., at 5). But these differences aside, the fact
that we have repeatedly found AEDPA cases involving
Strickland to be controlled by established precedent
underscores that the application of Strickland in a new
context should almost never result in a new rule.
3
 Even before IIRIRA and
St. Cyr, lawyers of course understood that it was good
practice to inform clients of the deportation consequences of a
plea. See ante, at 14, n. 15 (citing 3 ABA
Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to
Pleas of Guilty §3.2(b), Commentary, p. 71 (App. Draft 1968)).
Following the sea change in immigration law, however, the
professional norms had become so established and universally
recognized that the measure of constitutionally adequate
performance now included giving such advice in the form
Padilla recognized. See 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
10).

 See, e.g., INS
v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S.

important . . . than any potential jail sentence” (internal
quotation marks omitted)); Jordan v. De George,
341 U.S.
223, 243 (1951) (Jackson, J., dissenting) (deportation
proceedings “practically . . . are [criminal] for they extend
the criminal process of sentencing to include on the same
convictions an additional punishment”); Fong Haw Tan
v. Phelan, 333 U.S.

(“[D]eportation is a drastic measure and at times the
equivalent of banishment or exile”); Ng Fung Ho v.
White, 259 U.S.

property and life; or of all that makes life worth living”);

cruel”).

 The majority cites a law
review article for the proposition that the categorical
consequences rule is “one of ‘the most widely
recognized rules of American law.’ ” Ante,
at 8 (quoting Chin & Holmes, Effective Assistance of Counsel
and the Consequences of Guilty Pleas, 87 Cornell L. Rev. 697,
706 (2002)). But the article was, in fact, quite critical of the
rule. The authors explained that “[t]he real work of the
conviction is performed by the collateral consequences,” and
that the direct/collateral distinction in the context of
ineffective-assistance claimswas “surprising because it seems
inconsistent with the framework that the Supreme Court . . . laid
out” in Strickland. Chin & Holmes,
at700–701.
