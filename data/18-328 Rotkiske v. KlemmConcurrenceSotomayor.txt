															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 18–328

															KEVIN C. ROTKISKE, PETITIONER v. PAUL KLEMM, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit

															[December 10, 2019]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring.

															Like my colleagues in both the majority and the partial dissent, I agree that

15 U. S. C. §1692k(d) is a one-year statute of limitations that typically begins to run when the alleged violation “occurs,” not when the plaintiff discovers it.  Compare ante, at 1, with post, at 1 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting in part and from judgment).  The only daylight between the majority and dissenting opinions is whether  petitioner Rotkiske forfeited reliance on an “equitable, fraud-specific discovery rule” that forgives otherwise untimely filings.  Ante, at 6–7; cf. post, at 4–5.  Because I believe the Court of Appeals fairly found that Rotkiske failed to preserve an equitable argument of this sort, see 890 F.3d 422, 429, and n. 5 (CA3 2018), and because the Court did not grant certiorari on that doctrine, I join the majority opinion.

															I write separately to emphasize that this fraud-specific equitable principle is not the “ ‘bad wine of recent vintage’ ” of which my colleagues speak.  Ante, at 5 (quoting TRW Inc. v. Andrews,

534 U.S. 19, 37 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)).  Rather, the Court has long “recogni[zed]” and applied this “historical exception for suits based on fraud.”  Id., at 37; see also id., at 27 (majority opinion) (noting equitable discovery rule “in cases of fraud or concealment”); Holmberg v. Armbrecht,

327 U.S. 392 (1946); Exploration Co. v. United States,

247 U.S. 435 (1918); Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342 (1875); Sherwood v. Sutton, 21 F. Cas. 1303 (No. 12,782) (CC NH 1828) (Story, J.).  Nothing in today’s decision prevents parties from invoking that well-settled doctrine.
