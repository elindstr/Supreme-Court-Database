															Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Gorsuch
joins, and with whom Justice Kagan joins as to all but Part III,
dissenting.

															From early American laws, to dictionaries, to
modern federal and state obstruction statutes, interference with an
ongoing investigation or proceeding is at the core of what it means
to be “an offense relating to obstruction of justice,”
8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(S). The Court circumvents
this ample evidence only by casting a wide net and then throwing
back all but the bycatch. That approach “turns the
categorical approach on its head,” Esquivel-Quintana
v. Sessions, 581 U.S. 385, 393 (2017), and subverts the
commonly understood meaning of “obstruction of justice”
when Congress enacted §1101(a)(43)(S) in 1996. I respectfully
dissent.

															I

															The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)
defines “aggravated felony” by enumerating a long list
of offenses. §1101(a)(43). Some are federal criminal offenses,
but others are undefined generic offenses, such as
“burglary,” §1101(a)(43)(G), and
“obstruction of justice,” §1101(a) (43)(S), which
is relevant here.

															To assess whether someone’s conviction is
covered by a generic offense, our precedents dictate that courts
use the “categorical approach.”
Esquivel-Quintana, 581 U. S., at 389. That approach
disregards facts about the conviction and instead “compare[s]
the elements of the statute forming the basis of the
defendant’s conviction with the elements of the
‘generic’ crime—i.e., the offense as
commonly understood.” Descamps v. United
States, 570 U.S.
254, 257 (2013). If the elements of the underlying crime of
conviction are narrower than or the same as the elements of the
generic offense, then there is a “categorical match,”
Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S.
184, 190 (2013), and the underlying offense is an aggravated
felony. If there is no categorical match, then the conviction is
not an aggravated felony, no matter the underlying facts.

															Before a court can engage in this categorical
comparison, however, it must discern the “basic
elements” of the relevant “generic” offense.
Taylor v. United States, 495
U.S. 575, 599 (1990). Courts accomplish this task by looking
for “evidence about the generic meaning” of the offense
at the time of the statute’s enactment.
Esquivel-Quintana, 581 U. S., at 395. This means
looking for the “generally accepted contemporary
meaning” of the generic offense, while setting aside more
unusual “nongeneric” variants that are “defin[ed]
. . . more broadly.” Taylor, 495 U. S.,
at 596, 599. In Taylor, for example, this Court concluded,
after surveying various sources of meaning, that for purposes of 18
U. S. C. §924(e), “generic burglary”
encompasses any crime “having the basic elements of unlawful
or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or
structure, with intent to commit a crime.” 495 U. S., at
599. In reaching that conclusion, the Court purposefully excluded
burglary convictions in a handful of States that “defin[ed]
burglary more broadly” by “eliminating the requirement
that the entry be unlawful, or by including places, such as
automobiles and vending machines, other than buildings.”
Ibid. Expanding the definition to include those statutes
would have strayed too far from “the generic definition of
bribery . . . intended by Congress.” Id., at
595 (internal quotation marks omitted).

															The question presented in these
cases—whether “an offense relating to obstruction of
justice,” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a) (43)(S),
necessarily involves a pending investigation or proceeding—is
a question about the “basic elements” of
“generic” obstruction of justice. Taylor, 495
U. S., at 599. That is, it is a question about how obstruction
of justice was “commonly understood,” Descamps,
570 U. S., at 257, in 1996 when Congress enacted
§1101(a)(43)(S). Answering that question requires focusing on
the core, “generally accepted contemporary meaning,”
Taylor, 495 U. S., at 596, of obstruction of justice,
rather than on more unusual “nongeneric” variants that
are “define[d] . . . more broadly,”
id., at 599.

															The Court loses sight of this fundamental point.
Instead of focusing on whether a pending investigation or
proceeding is part of the heartland of obstruction of justice, it
wanders off into an array of obstruction-adjacent federal and state
laws that do not require a pending investigation or proceeding. The
Court then announces that those offenses are core obstruction of
justice, even though the evidence it relies on, taken as a whole,
reveals they are not. The result is predictable. By defining
offenses that do not require a pending investigation or proceeding
as core obstruction of justice, the majority forces through the
conclusion that a pending investigation or proceeding is not
required to qualify as generic obstruction of justice.

															A reexamination of the sources relied upon by
the majority, with the appropriate focus on discerning the trunk of
obstruction of justice, rather than its various branches or
offshoots, leads to the opposite result: To qualify as “an
offense relating to obstruction of justice” under
§1101(a) (43)(S), a predicate offense must require a pending
investigation or proceeding.

															A

															As an initial matter, the majority glosses
over the critical fact that “obstruction of justice”
was an established term of art at the time of
§1101(a)(43)(S)’s enactment in 1996. This is a major
first misstep because “[w]here Congress employs a term of art
obviously transplanted from another legal source, it brings the old
soil with it.” George v. McDonough, 596
U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation
marks omitted).

															From the “old soil” until today,
“obstruction of justice” has required a pending
investigation or proceeding. In 1831, Congress forbade efforts
“to influence, intimidate, or impede any juror, witness, or
officer, in any court of the United States, in the discharge
of his duty” or “to obstruct or impede, the due
administration of justice therein.” Act of Mar. 2, 1831,
ch. 99, 4 Stat. 488 (emphasis added). This provision, which became
§5399 of the Revised Statutes, see Rev. Stat., Title 70, ch.
4, §5399 (1875), laid “the foundation for the modern
statutory incarnation of the offense of obstruction of
justice.” E. Murphy, Manufacturing Crime: Process, Pretext,
and Criminal Justice, 97 Geo. L. J. 1435, 1473 (2009).

															In Pettibone v. United States,
148 U.S.
197 (1893), this Court confirmed that §5399 required a
pending proceeding. After describing the law as criminalizing
“obstruction of the due administration of justice in any
court of the United States,” the Court explained that
“such obstruction can only arise when justice is being
administered.” Id., at 207. “Unless that fact
exists, the statutory offense cannot be committed.”
Ibid. The Court thus tied obstruction of justice under
§5399 to “the pendency of proceedings in the United
States court, or the progress of the administration of justice
therein.” Id., at 205.

															Section 5399 is the predecessor of the modern
omnibus or catchall obstruction of justice clause, which is
codified at 18 U. S. C. §1503, and which prohibits
endeavoring “to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due
administration of justice.” In recognition of this through
line, this Court held, just a year before the enactment of
§1101(a)(43)(S), that “a person lacking knowledge of a
pending proceeding” cannot be convicted under §1503.
United States v. Aguilar, 515
U.S. 593, 599 (1995) (citing Pettibone, 148 U. S.,
at 207). Underscoring this point in his partial concurrence,
Justice Scalia explained that “an endeavor to obstruct
proceedings that did not exist would not violate the statute”
because “obstruction can only arise when justice is being
administered.” 515 U. S., at 610, n. 1 (alteration
and internal quotation marks omitted).

															Congress was aware of this settled
interpretation of §1503 when it added “obstruction of
justice” to the INA’s list of aggravated felonies. See
Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U. S. ___, ___
(2020) (slip op., at 10) (“We normally assume that Congress
is aware of relevant judicial precedent when it enacts a new
statute” (internal quotation marks omitted)). In fact, by
1996 Congress had already demonstrated that “relating to
obstruction of justice” was understood to capture §1503.
Enacted in 1970, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (RICO) specifically lists as a predicate offense “section
1503 (relating to obstruction of justice).” 18
U. S. C. §1961(1). Moreover, this language, just
like the language at §1101(a)(43)(S), serves the purpose of
identifying one of a long list of underlying offenses to which an
overarching statute applies. Thus, by 1996, Congress had used the
same phrase for the same purpose to refer to §1503. In fact,
the INA’s list of aggravated felonies explicitly
cross-references RICO, suggesting Congress was well aware of the
parallel. See §1101(a)(43)(J) (INA listing RICO violation as
an aggravated felony).[1]

															In short, in searching for the heartland of
obstruction of justice, the omnibus clause of §1503 and the
history from which it is derived are invaluable touchstones.
Neither countenances an obstruction of justice offense separate
from a pending investigation or proceeding.[2]

															B

															Even setting this crucial historical evidence
aside, and proceeding as the Court does, by looking to dictionary
definitions, chapter 73 of the Federal Criminal Code, state
statutes, and the Model Penal Code, the same result emerges: Core
obstruction of justice requires a pending investigation or
proceeding.

															1

															Begin with the central dictionary definition
upon which the Court relies. It defines obstruction of justice as
“the crime or act of willfully interfering with the
process of justice and law esp. by influencing, threatening,
harming, or impeding a witness, potential witness, juror, or
judicial or legal officer or by furnishing false information in
or otherwise impeding an investigation or legal process.”
Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law 337 (1996) (emphasis
added).

															While the Court claims that this definition
omits any requirement of a pending investigation or proceeding,
ante, at 4, the two italicized phrases say otherwise.
“[I]nterference” means the “act of meddling in or
hampering an activity or process,” Webster’s Third New
International Dictionary 1178 (1993), while “impede”
means “to interfere with or get in the way of the progress
of ” something or someone, id., at 1132. The
definition is clear that the process that is meddled in, or
interfered with, is the “process of justice and law” or
“an investigation or legal process.”[3]

															For the same reason, the majority is too hasty
when it asserts that the definition encompasses acts separate from
a pending investigation or proceeding. That definition ends with
the phrase “in . . . an investigation or legal
process.” Under the series-qualifier canon, that phrase is
best read to modify all listed verbs, especially because the
definition lists each action as an example of “the crime or
act of willfully interfering with the process of justice and
law.” See Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid, 592
U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 5) (“[W]hen there is
a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or
verbs in a series, a modifier at the end of the list normally
applies to the entire series” (internal quotation marks
omitted)). Thus, far from favoring the majority’s view, the
definition most naturally supports the conclusion that interference
with a pending investigation or proceeding is an element of generic
obstruction of justice.

															The other dictionary definitions upon which the
Court relies similarly indicate the need for a pending
investigation or proceeding. The majority notes that Black’s
Law Dictionary defines obstruction of justice to cover
“ ‘obstructing the administration of justice in
any way,’ ” ante, at 4, but overlooks the
fact that “administration of justice,” both
historically and currently, refers to court proceedings. See,
e.g., 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *290
(“[T]he judiciary power is intrusted with the administration
of justice”); Black’s Law Dictionary 53 (10th ed. 2014)
(defining “due administration of justice” as
“[t]he proper functioning and integrity of a court or other
tribunal and the proceedings before it”). Similarly, the full
definition from A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage mentions
“interference with the orderly administration of law.”
B. Garner, p. 611 (2d ed. 1995). The cited definitions thus all
weigh against the majority’s sweeping view, and in favor of
the view that obstruction of justice “can only arise when
justice is being administered.” Pettibone, 148
U. S., at 207.

															2

															The federal offenses listed in chapter 73 of
Title 18, which is entitled “Obstruction of Justice,”
provide further support for the conclusion that core obstruction of
justice requires the administration of justice.

															When Congress codified chapter 73 in 1948, the
chapter contained six provisions, each of which requires a
connection to a pending proceeding or investigation. See Act of
June 25, 1948, §§1501–1506, 62 Stat. 769–770.
The central provision is §1503, with its omnibus or catchall
prohibition against endeavoring “to influence, obstruct, or
impede, the due administration of justice.” As already
explained, supra, at 5, it is undisputed that
§1503’s omnibus clause requires a pending proceeding.
The same is true for the other five provisions, all of which either
refer to ongoing legal processes or cover conduct that can arise
only during legal proceedings.[4]

															By the time Congress passed 8 U. S. C.
§1101(a)(43)(S) in 1996, Congress had added nine narrower,
more specific offenses to the six original offenses
(§§1501–1506) in chapter 73. See 18
U. S. C. §§1507–1513,
1516–1517.[5] While it is
less clear that those specialized provisions fall within the
heartland of obstruction of justice, even the vast majority of them
require a connection to a proceeding or investigation.[6] See §1507 (“picket[ing]
or parad[ing]” with the intent to interfere with “the
administration of justice”); §1508 (listening to or
recording jury “deliberat[ions] or voting”); §1510
(interference with reports of information “to a criminal
investigator”); §1516 (interfering with a “Federal
auditor in the performance of official duties”); §1509
(interfering with “due exercise of rights” under a
court order); §1513 (retaliating against a witness for
participating in “an official proceeding”).

															The primary outlier amongst the more recent
additions to chapter 73 is §1512, which criminalizes tampering
with a witness, victim, or informant. As the majority notes, that
provision provides that “[f]or purposes of this section
. . . an official proceeding need not be pending or about
to be instituted at the time of the offense.”
§1512(f )(1). Instead of favoring the majority’s
conclusion, however, §1512 is the exception that proves the
rule. There would be no need to clarify that the provision applies
absent a pending proceeding unless there were an established
background understanding that obstruction of justice requires such
a proceeding.[7] Because the
question at hand concerns the meaning of heartland obstruction of
justice, excluding “nongeneric” variants
“defin[ed] . . . more broadly,”
Taylor, 495 U. S., at 599, what matters here is the
general rule, not a singular exception to it. To use a lighthearted
example, it is clear that the “generic” meaning of
“mammal” includes giving birth to live young, even
though the platypus is an exception to that rule. Section 1512 thus
proves the opposite of what the majority takes it to
prove.[8]

															The Court instead reasons that because
§1512 does not require a pending investigation or proceeding,
the answer to the question “Does generic obstruction of
justice require a pending investigation or proceeding?” must
be “No.” That line of thinking, however, simply assumes
that §1512 falls within generic obstruction (it assumes the
platypus is heartland mammalia). In so assuming, the Court loses
sight of the task at hand, which is, again, to answer a question
about the trunk of obstruction of justice, not more broadly defined
offshoots. See Descamps, 570 U. S., at 257. All signs
point toward treating §1512 as just such an offshoot, at least
insofar as it explicitly chooses to dispose with the requirement
that a proceeding “be pending or about to be instituted at
the time of the offense.” §1512(f )(1).

															3

															The text of the INA itself confirms that
Congress did not understand obstruction of justice to encompass all
witness tampering. In the very same subsection of the INA at issue
here, Congress expressly used the term “witness
tampering” separately from “obstruction of
justice.” 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(15)(U)(iii).
Specifically, in a set of provisions defining “U”
nonimmigrant status,[9]
Congress again enumerated a list of offenses, many of which overlap
with the aggravated felonies in §1101(a)(43). See
§1101(a)(15)(U)(iii); cf. §§1101(a)(43). Just as it
did for aggravated felonies, Congress included “obstruction
of justice” in the list. This time, however, Congress added
witness tampering in addition to obstruction of justice by listing
“witness tampering; obstruction of justice; [or]
perjury” as distinct offenses. §1101(a)(15)(U)(iii); cf.
§1101(a)(43)(S) (“obstruction of justice, perjury or
subornation of perjury, or bribery of a witness”).

															The Court’s broad interpretation of
“obstruction of justice,” which swallows up all witness
tampering, cannot be reconciled with this statutory text. If, on
the one hand, the Court applies the same broad meaning to
“obstruction of justice” in §1101(a)(15)(U)(iii),
then “witness tampering” becomes redundant, in
violation of the canon that statutes should be read “so as to
avoid rendering superfluous any parts thereof.” Astoria
Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U.S.
104, 112 (1991). If, on the other hand, the Court attempts to
avoid this problem by interpreting “obstruction of
justice” differently across the two provisions, then it
violates “the established canon of construction that similar
language contained within the same section of a statute must be
accorded a consistent meaning.” National Credit Union
Admin. v. First Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 522 U.S.
479, 501 (1998). Either way, the Court’s interpretation
fails.

															Although §1101(a)(43)(S) refers to
“an offense relating to obstruction of justice,” while
§1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) refers to “criminal activity
. . . involving . . . obstruction of
justice” “or any similar activity,” these textual
differences only reinforce that Congress understood
“obstruction of justice” and “witness
tampering” to have quite different ordinary meanings. Given
that §1101(a)(15)(U)(iii) covers not just “obstruction
of justice” but “any similar activity,” one must
infer that Congress took witness tampering to be not only distinct
from obstruction of justice, but distinct enough to need separate
mention from “obstruction of justice” “or any
similar activity.”

															Nor does it matter that §1101(a)(15)(U) was
added to the INA in 2000 as part of the Victims of Trafficking and
Violence Protection Act. 114 Stat. 1534. On the contrary, the fact
that Congress understood “obstruction of justice” to be
distinct from “witness tampering” just four years after
enacting §1101(a)(43)(S) is good evidence Congress understood
the same to be true in 1996, when it deemed “obstruction of
justice” an aggravated felony under the INA. After all,
“no one here suggests that the ordinary understanding in the
years after 1996 somehow differed from the ordinary understanding
in 1996.” Ante, at 5, n. 1.

															4

															State law points to the same result as the
other indicia of meaning examined thus far. State law is relevant
because, in discerning the generic meaning of terms with common-law
roots, the Court will often survey state statutes in effect at the
time the federal statute in question was enacted. See
Taylor, 495 U. S., at 598–599 (considering how
“burglary” was understood “in the criminal codes
of most States”). Here, when §1101(a)(43)(S) was enacted
in 1996, 13 States and the District of Columbia had a crime deemed
“obstruction of ” or “obstructing”
“justice.” The majority of those state statutes (eight
in total) required a connection to an investigation or proceeding
that was pending, or at least reasonably foreseeable, while the
remainder were ambiguous on the matter.[10] Thus, when §1101(a)(43)(S) was added to the
INA in 1996, obstruction of justice
“ ‘generally’ ” or
“ ‘typically’ ” required such a
connection. Id., at 598.

															The majority avoids this conclusion only by,
once again, adopting a circular approach. In analyzing state law,
the majority looks exclusively to state witness tampering statutes,
which it simply assumes are “state obstruction
offenses.” Ante, at 5. It then concludes that because
many of those statutes do not require a pending investigation or
proceeding, neither does obstruction of justice under the INA.
Ibid. As should be clear by now, that method gets the
categorical approach backward; if the overarching federal category
is assumed to include the state offenses in question, there will
always be a categorical match. One cannot prove that all state
witness tampering laws fall within the INA’s “relating
to obstruction of justice” simply by assuming that they
do.[11]

															The majority also relies on the Model Penal Code
(MPC). Ante, at 5–6. Although the MPC sometimes can
provide supplemental evidence of generic meaning, see
Taylor, 495 U. S., at 598, n. 8, it is critical to
bear in mind that the MPC is fundamentally a “reform
movemen[t].” United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S.
394, 403 (1980). Where that reform involves a definitive break
from the state of the law at the time in question, the MPC is of
limited value in discerning generic meaning. Such is the case here.
The MPC eschews any talk of “obstruction of justice,”
and instead sets out a series of articles under the heading
“Offenses Against Public Administration.” ALI, MPC
§§240–243 (1980). Those articles cover many
offenses, such as escape from prison (§242.6), perjury
(§241.1), and bribery (§240.1) that are clearly not
generic obstruction of justice (indeed, perjury and bribery are
listed separately from obstruction of justice in
§1101(a)(43)(S)). Even in the article that most closely
parallels traditional obstruction of justice (§242.1
“Obstructing Administration of Law or Other Governmental
Function”), the MPC gave the word
“ ‘obstructs’ ” an
“expansive meaning,” §242.1, Comment 2, at 203,
and “intended” for the offense described to
“reach all legitimate activities of government,” not
just “the administration of justice,” id., at
203–204. Because of these departures, which have not been
widely adopted, the MPC carries little weight for purposes of
discerning the core that forms generic obstruction of justice.

															Despite these issues, the majority focuses,
again without justification, on the MPC’s description of
witness tampering (§241.6). See ante, at 6. Even
setting aside the now-familiar circularity of this reasoning, this
definition does not help the majority either. In describing witness
tampering, the MPC reformers chose to depart from “laws
requiring that a proceeding or investigation actually be
pending,” §241.6, Comment 2, at 166, by requiring only a
“belie[f] that an official proceeding or investigation is
pending or about to be instituted,” §241.6(1)
(emphasis added). That intentional departure is reason alone to
treat this MPC description with caution when articulating generic
obstruction of justice. Yet, the majority goes much further than
the MPC reformers by dismissing the notion that at least a
foreseeable investigation or proceeding should be required. See
ante, at 7, n. 2. That statement by the Court reflects
just how far afield it has wandered from the heartland of
obstruction of justice.

															Perhaps sensing the weakness of its evidence,
the Court falls back on the Government’s “commonsense
point,” Reply Brief 4, that “one can obstruct the
wheels of justice even before the wheels have begun to move,”
ante, at 6. Yet the intuitive idea that “obstruction
can only arise when justice is being administered,”
Pettibone, 148 U. S., at 207, finds support in common
sense to at least the same degree. But while both formulations find
some support in common sense, the same cannot be said regarding
other clues about generic meaning. Considered together, the
relevant history, dictionaries, and federal and state laws provide
powerful evidence that obstruction of justice “as commonly
understood,” Descamps, 570 U. S., at 257, when
Congress enacted 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(S) in 1996,
requires a pending investigation or proceeding.

															II

															In a feeble attempt to shore up its argument,
the Court resorts to a seemingly limitless construction of
“relating to obstruction of justice,”
§1101(a)(43)(S), according to which the phrase “relating
to” covers all offenses “that have ‘a connection
with’ obstruction of justice,” ante, at 7. That
reading is a direct result of the Court’s failure to consider
statutory text and context when interpreting “relating
to.” After all, “in isolation” that phrase is
endlessly expansive because, absent a statute-specific
“limiting principle,” relations “stop
nowhere.” Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.S.
48, 59–60 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Here, one look at statutory text and context confirms that
“relating to” must have a narrower meaning.

															The text of the INA “makes [non-U. S.
citizens] removable based on the nature of their convictions, not
based on their actual conduct.” Esquivel-Quintana, 581
U. S., at 389. This explains why, when applying
§1101(a)(43)(S), courts use the categorical approach, which
compares the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic
offense. Without a delineated generic offense, however, this
comparison falters. The Court’s nebulous reading of
“relating to obstruction of justice, perjury or
subornation of perjury, or bribery of a witness,”
§1101(a)(43)(S) (emphasis added), fails to grapple with this
reality. Rather than ask whether a conviction is a categorical
match for, say, generic “perjury,” the majority seems
to suggest courts should ask if the conviction has “a
connection with” generic perjury. If that is what the
majority intends, it is not clear what that question means or how
courts should go about answering it.

															In contrast, no such problem arises if “an
offense relating to . . . perjury” or “an
offense relating to obstruction of justice” is understood
narrowly to mean simply “an offense qualifying as generic
perjury” or “an offense qualifying as generic
obstruction of justice.” The broader statutory context
confirms this reading. Again and again, §1101(a)(43) uses the
phrase “relating to” in descriptive parentheticals to
introduce an ordinary language description of other aggravated
felonies. For example, to identify the money laundering offenses in
18 U. S. C. §1956, the INA refers to “an
offense described in section 1956 of title 18 (relating to
laundering of money instruments).” §1101(a)(43)(D)
(emphasis added). This structure, which the INA repeats well over a
dozen times, see
§§1101(a)(43)(D)–(E),(H)–(N), confirms that
the phrase “relating to” is used in the INA simply to
introduce (not expand upon) a general description of the intended
crime category.

															The Court’s seemingly expansive reading of
“in relation to” is also refuted by its consequences
for the statutory text. If all that is required is a
“connection with” something that “obstruct[s] the
wheels of justice,” ante, at 6–7, then the
Government has open season to argue that all sorts of crimes that
hinder law enforcement (e.g., failing to report a crime) or
make detection of a crime more difficult (e.g., money
laundering) qualify as offenses “relating to obstruction of
justice.” On this approach, certain other aggravated felonies
listed in the INA (e.g., §1101(a)(43)(D) (money
laundering)) will collapse into “obstruction of
justice,” leading to substantial superfluity in the statute.
Indeed, the separate categories of perjury and bribery of a witness
listed in the very same subparagraph, §1101(a)(43)(S), will
themselves be part of that collapse.

															More importantly, an expansive reading of
“in relation to” opens the door for the Government to
argue that many low-level offenses that fall outside of core
obstruction of justice are “aggravated” felonies, even
though the INA reserves that label for “especially egregious
felonies.” Esquivel-Quintana, 581 U. S., at 394.
For example, misdemeanor convictions for failing to report a crime,
presenting false identification to an officer, refusing to aid a
police officer, leaving the scene of a crime, or purchasing a fake
ID could be taken to count as “relating to obstruction of
justice.” See Brief for National Immigrant Justice Center et
al. as Amici
Curiae 10–25 (collecting
offenses).[12]

															This significant potential for
“redundancy,” “unfairness,” and
“arbitrary” enforcement should have led the Court to
“exercise interpretive restraint,” Marinello v.
United States, 584 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2018) (slip
op., at 7, 9) (internal quotation marks omitted), when construing
“relating to.” Indeed, the many problems with an
expansive reading of “relating to” raise the question
whether the Court even really intends to adopt such a reading,
especially because the relevant discussion occupies a single
paragraph. Perhaps instead the Court simply offers up
“connection with” as a synonym for “relating
to,” leaving it for lower courts to settle what that phrase
actually means.

															III

															While the evidence assembled here is far
stronger than any offered by the majority, the sheer complexity of
the task at hand leaves lingering ambiguity, even if the Court
claims it does not see it. Cf. ante, at 10. To the extent
doubts remain, however, they are resolved in favor of a narrower
understanding of §1101(a)(43)(S) by the “longstanding
principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation
statutes in favor of the [non-U. S. citizen].”
INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S.
421, 449 (1987).

															This Court resolves doubts in favor of the
non-U. S. citizen in keeping with the general rule that
ambiguities in penal statutes should be construed against the
government. After all, deportation is not only a kind of
“penalty,” but a “drastic measure” often
“the equivalent of banishment [or] exile.” Fong Haw
Tan v. Phelan, 333 U.S.
6, 10
(1948). Nowhere is that truer than here. Aggravated felonies under
the INA are “a category of crimes singled out for the
harshest deportation consequences.” Carachuri-Rosendo
v. Holder, 560 U.S.
563, 566 (2010). If a non-U. S. citizen is convicted of an
aggravated felony, even if she has a green card and has lived in
this country for years, she is subject to removal and is also
ineligible for readmission and many forms of immigration relief.
See 8 U. S. C. §§1158(b)(2), 1182(a)(9)(A),
1182(h), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(a)(3), 1229c(a)(1).
“Accordingly, removal is a virtually certainty for [a
non-U. S. citizen] found to have an aggravated felony
conviction, no matter how long he has previously resided
here.” Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U. S. ___,
___–___ (2018) (slip op., at 1–2). Moreover, a person
convicted of an “aggravated felony” faces heighted
criminal sanctions for disobeying orders of removal,
§1253(a)(1), or reentering the United States without
permission, §1326(b)(2). For example, the penalty for illegal
reentry skyrockets from 2 years to 20. See §§1326(a),
(b)(2).

															This Court has been clear that, in the face of
such stakes, it “will not assume that Congress meant to
trench on [a non-U. S. citizen’s] freedom beyond that
which is required by the narrowest of several possible meanings of
the words used.” Fong Haw Tan, 333 U. S., at 10.
While it may be true that certain broader readings of
“obstruction of justice” are “at least
plausible,” ante, at 3 (Jackson, J., concurring), that
is not good enough because it is, at the very minimum, at least
equally plausible that “obstruction of justice”
requires a pending investigation or proceeding. The Court should
have “err[ed] on the side of underinclusiveness” when
interpreting §1101(a)(43). Moncrieffe, 569 U. S.,
at 205.

															IV

															By rejecting a central feature of core
obstruction of justice and adopting a seemingly expansive reading
of “relating to,” the Court leaves generic obstruction
of justice without any discernible shape. The Court thus injects
further chaos into the already fraught question of how to
understand §1101(a)(43)(S) and opens the door for the
Government to try to use that provision as a catchall for all sorts
of criminal activity, whether aggravated or not.

															The Court could perhaps have reined in some of
that chaos by giving “obstruction of justice”
affirmative shape and boundaries in other ways, but it makes no
effort to do so. Instead, the Court simply rejects the legal
proposition that a pending investigation or proceeding is required
for a predicate offense to qualify under §1101(a)(43)(S). At
bottom, its reasoning in support of that conclusion boils down to a
simple syllogism, which it clothes in various guises: (1)
Dissuading a witness from reporting a crime to the police qualifies
as obstruction of justice; (2) the offense of dissuading a witness
from reporting a crime does not require a pending investigation or
proceeding; thus (3) some offense qualifying as obstruction of
justice does not require a pending investigation or proceeding.

															The flaw in this syllogism is, of course,
premise (1). By assuming, up front and without reason, that
dissuading a witness from reporting a crime qualifies as
obstruction of justice, the Court oversteps. Congress could, if it
wanted, add witness tampering to the INA’s lengthy list of
aggravated felonies, just as it did with the list of offenses at
§1101(a)(15)(U)(iii), but it has not done so. The
Court’s decision today makes that judgment call for Congress.
“Our license to interpret statutes does not include the power
to engage in such freewheeling judicial policymaking.”
Pereida v. Wilkinson, 592 U. S. ___, ___ (2021)
(slip op., at 16).

															The syllogism’s conclusion is also
noteworthy for its narrowness. In the end, all the Court really
holds is that generic obstruction of justice includes one offense
(dissuading a witness from reporting a crime) that does not require
a pending investigation or proceeding. Lower courts faced with
difficult questions about what offenses qualify as categorical
matches for §1101(a)(43)(S) would do well to bear in mind the
limited nature of that holding. Many open questions remain
regarding whether offenses other than dissuading a witness from
reporting a crime are categorical matches for §1101(a)(43)(S),
what affirmative understanding of §1101(a)(43)(S) should guide
that categorical analysis, and whether other offenses that also
lack a connection to a pending investigation or proceeding can
qualify under that analysis.[13] I do not take the majority to be addressing any of
these questions, and great care is warranted in answering them in
the future.

															*  *  *

															By eliminating a central constraint on what
qualifies as “an offense relating to obstruction of
justice” under §1101(a)(43)(S), while providing zero
affirmative guidance as to what sorts of offenses are a match for
that category, the majority leaves lower courts and the Board of
Immigration Appeals without direction and invites the Government to
advance far-ranging constructions of §1101(a)(43)(S) that bear
little resemblance to core obstruction of justice. I would leave it
to Congress, not the Judiciary, to decide which additional crimes
should be listed as aggravated felonies under the INA. I
respectfully dissent.

Notes
1
 The majority argues that
if Congress had wanted offenses “relating to obstruction of
justice” to “have the same coverage as
§1503(a),” then Congress could have just
“cross-referenced §1503(a) in
§1101(a)(43)(S).” Ante., at 8. This argument
misses the point entirely. If Congress had done that, then only
persons convicted under §1503 would qualify. Congress’s
use of the generic “obstruction of justice,” however,
clearly signals that Congress wanted other state and federal
offenses sharing the same basic elements to be included as well.
Section 1503 is a strong indicator of the generic meaning of
“obstruction of justice” in §1101(a)(43)(S), not
its equivalent.
2
 Although the Court quotes
Blackstone’s statement that “ ‘dis-suad[ing]
a witness from giving evidence’ ” was an
“ ‘impedimen[t] of justice’ ” in
support of its position, ante, at 8, Blackstone actually
supports this dissent. The Court ignores that in historical usage
“giving evidence” meant “testifying” at a
proceeding. See, e.g., 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the
Laws of England 305 (1768) (“[E]very defence, which cannot be
thus specially pleaded, may be given in evidence, upon the general
issue at the trial”); 2 M. Hale, History of the Pleas of the
Crown 280 (1736) (“If a reward be promised to a person for
giving his evidence before he gives it, this, if proved, disables
his testimony”). The majority also ignores that the
Blackstone passage is discussing “[c]ontempts against the
king’s . . . courts of justice.” 4
Blackstone, Commentaries, at 124 (1769). This context confirms
Blackstone is referring to impeding a witness from testifying at a
proceeding, because otherwise it would not be a contempt against
the king’s courts.
3
 While it is possible to
talk about interfering with or impeding a process before it has
even begun, those phrases more naturally connote an effect on a
process that is ongoing. For example, talk of interfering in a
hiring process strongly suggests that hiring-related activities are
already underway. Certainly where an upcoming hiring is not even
foreseeable, it would be unusual to talk of such inference. Yet,
the majority does not require even a foreseeable investigation or
proceeding in order for there to be obstruction of justice. See
ante, at 7, n. 2.
4
 The five other original
chapter 73 offenses are §1501 (“Assault on process
server”); §1502 (“Resistance to extradition
agent”); §1504 (“Influencing juror by
writing”); §1505 (“Influencing or injuring witness
before agencies and committees”); and §1506
(“Theft or alteration of record or process; false
bail”). These provisions remain in chapter 73 to this day,
with only modest revisions that do not change the need for a
pending investigation or proceeding.
5
 §31(a), 64 Stat.
1018 (adding §1507 in 1950); §1, 70 Stat. 935 (adding
§1508 in 1956); §101, 74 Stat. 86 (adding §1509 in
1960); Pub. L. 90–123, §1(a), 81 Stat. 362 (adding
§1510 in 1967); §802(a), 84 Stat. 936 (adding §1511
in 1970); §4(a), 96 Stat. 1249 (adding §1512 in 1982);
id., at 1250 (adding §1513 in 1982); §7078(a), 102
Stat. 4406 (adding §1516 in 1988); §2503(a), 104 Stat.
4861 (adding §1517 in 1990).
6
 The two exceptions are
§§1511 and 1512. Section 1511 is a special-ized
provision, enacted as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of
1970, §802, 84 Stat. 936, which prohibits “conspir[ing]
to obstruct the enforcement of the criminal laws of a State
. . . with the intent to facilitate an illegal gambling
business.” 18 U. S. C. §1511(a). Given that
§1511 is a specialized conspiracy provision intended to
“discourage organized crime’s corruption of state and
local officials for the purpose of facilitating gambling
enterprises,” Iannelli v. United States,
420 U.S.
770, 788 (1975), it has no bearing on core obstruction of
justice. Section 1512 is discussed infra, at
10–11.
7
 In a testament to the
gravitational force of the weighty background rule that a pending
proceeding is generally required, this Court has interpreted
§1512 to at least require a foreseeable proceeding. See
Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 544 U.S.
696, 707–708 (2005).
8
 The majority also
mentions §1518 (Obstruction of criminal investigations of
health care offenses) and §1519 (Destruction, alteration, or
falsification of records in federal investigations and bankruptcy),
which were enacted after Congress passed §1101(a)(43)(S). See
§245(a), 110 Stat. 2017 (adding §1518 in 1996);
§802(a), 116 Stat. 800 (adding §1519 in 2002). Both are
highly “specialized” provisions concerned with
“corporate fraud and financial audits.” Yates v.
United States, 574 U.S.
528, 541 (2015) (plurality opinion). Given that these later
enacted offenses are specialized extensions of obstruction of
justice, they are irrelevant to determining what Congress in 1996
understood as the generic meaning of “obstruction of
justice” in §1101(a)(43)(S). While the concurrence
suggests that “obstruction of justice” is coextensive
with chapter 73, ante, at 2–3 (opinion of Jackson,
J.), the concurrence (like the majority) does not engage with these
issues regarding §§1518 and 1519, nor with the problems
noted above about §§1511 and 1512, see supra, at
9–11, even though all of these issues have been thoroughly
ventilated in these cases. See Brief for Petitioner in No.
22–23, pp. 23–29; Brief for Respondent in No.
22–331, pp. 15–21; Brief for Attorney General
24–31.

 Persons eligible for
“U” nonimmigrant status are victims of certain
qualifying criminal activity who are helpful to officials
investigating or prosecuting such activity. See 8
U. S. C. §1101(a)(15)(U)(i).
10  See
Haw. Rev. Stat. §710–1072.5 (1996) (connection
required); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §14:130.1 (West 1996) (same);
Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, §26 (1996) (same); Miss. Code Ann.
§97–9–55 (1996) (same); Va. Code Ann.
§18.2–460 (1996) (same); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13,
§3015 (1996) (same); W. Va. Code Ann.

§5/31–4 (1996) (same); Mont. Code Ann.
§45–7–303 (1996) (same).
11  Moreover, even assuming state witness
tampering statutes are relevant, it is noteworthy that in 1996 the
vast majority of States (39 in total) categorized their witness
tampering statutes as something other than “obstruction of
justice.” See, e.g., Ala. Code
§13A–10–124 (1996) (categorized under
“Offenses Against Public Administration”); Colo. Rev.
Stat. §18–8–707 (1996) (categorized under
“Offenses—Governmental Operations”); Idaho Code
Ann. §18–2604 (1996) (categorized under “Evidence
Falsified or Concealed and Witnesses Intimidated or Bribed”);
see also Brief for Respondent in No. 22–331, pp. 26–28
(collecting statutes). Of the remaining 11 States that located
their witness tampering statutes in the part of the Criminal Code
prohibiting “obstructing” or “obstruction”
of “justice,” at least 7 required a connection to a
pending investigation or proceeding. See Ind. Code Ann.
§35–44–3–4(a)(1); Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27,
§26; Miss. Code Ann. §97–9–55; Nev. Rev.
Stat. Ann. §199.230 (1996); N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann.
§14–266 (1996); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13, §3015; W.
Va. Code Ann. §61–5–27. State law on the whole
thus favors a pending investigation or proceeding requirement for
generic obstruction of justice.
12  Of
course, many of the convictions the Government seeks to shoe-horn
into “obstruction of justice” are serious offenses,
even if they are not a categorical match for obstruction of
justice. Such convictions, however, may render non-U. S.
citizens removable for other reasons (e.g., if they qualify
as crimes involving moral turpitude). Moreover, when noncitizens
are removable, any discretionary immigration relief for which they
may be eligible will “depen[d] upon the discretion of the
Attorney General.” Carachuri-Rosendo v.
Holder, 560 U.S.
563, 581 (2010). Thus, any difference between the majority and
the dissent in terms of “practical effect on policing our
Nation’s borders . . . is a limited one.”
Ibid.
13  On
this list of open questions is whether state
accessory-after-the-fact convictions like petitioner Pugin’s
are a categorical match for §1101(a)(43)(S). The majority
affirms the Fourth Circuit’s legal holding that a pending
investigation or proceeding is unnecessary for an offense to
qualify under §1101(a)(43)(S). The majority is conspicuously
silent, however, regarding the underlying offense itself and
whether it is obstruction of justice under §1101(a)(43)(S).
And for good reason, because accessory offenses have their own
distinct pedigree and purpose with historical roots far afield from
that of obstruction of justice. Cf. R Perkins, Parties to Crime, 89
U. Pa. L. Rev. 581, 581–582, 605–607
(1941).
