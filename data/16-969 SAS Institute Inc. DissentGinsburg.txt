															SAS INSTITUTE INC., PETITIONER v. ANDREI IANCU, AS DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES PATENT  AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[April 24, 2018]

															Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.

															Given the Court’s wooden reading of

35 U. S. C. §318(a), and with “no mandate to institute [inter partes] review” at all, Cuozzo Speed Technologies, LLC v. Lee, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9), the Patent Trial and Appeal Board could simply deny a petition containing challenges having no “reasonable likelihood” of success, §314(a).  Simultaneously, the Board might note that one or more specified claims warrant reexamination, while others challenged in the petition do not.  Petitioners would then be free to file new or amended petitions shorn of challenges the Board finds unworthy of inter partes review.  Why should the statute be read to preclude the Board’s more rational way to weed out insubstantial challenges?  For the reasons stated by Justice Breyer, the Court’s opinion offers no persuasive answer to that question, and no cause to believe Congress wanted the Board to spend its time so uselessly.
