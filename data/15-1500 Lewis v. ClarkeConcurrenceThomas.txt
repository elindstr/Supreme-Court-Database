															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															BRIAN LEWIS, et al., PETITIONERS v.WILLIAM CLARKE

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of connecticut

															[April 25, 2017]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

															I remain of the view that tribal immunity does not extend “to suits arising out of a tribe’s commercial activities conducted beyond its territory.”  Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U. S. ___ (2014) (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 2); see also Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.,

523 U. S. 751,
764 (1998)
 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This suit arose from an off-reservation commercial act.  Ante, at 3.  Accordingly, I would hold that respondent cannot assert the Tribe’s immunity, regardless of the capacity in which he was sued.  Because the Court reaches the same result for different reasons, I concur in its judgment.
