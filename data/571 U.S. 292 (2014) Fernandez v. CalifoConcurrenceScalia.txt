															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 12–7822

															_________________

															WALTER FERNANDEZ, PETITIONER v. CALIFORNIA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal
of california for the second appellate district

															[February 25, 2014]

															

															     Justice Scalia,
concurring.

															     Like Justice Thomas, I
believe Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U. S. 103 (2006) , was
wrongly decided. I nonetheless join the Court’s opinion
because it is a faithful application of Randolph. I write
separately to address the argument that the search of
petitioner’s shared apartment violated the Fourth Amendment
because he had a right under property law to exclude the police.
See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as
Amicus Curiae 17–23. The United States dismisses that
argument,pointing to our statement in United States v. Matlock, 415
U. S. 164 , n. 7 (1974), that a cotenant’s ability
to con-sent to a search “does not rest upon the law of
property, with its attendant historical and legal
refinements.”See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
23.

															     I do not think the
argument can be so easily dismissed. To be sure, under Katz v.
United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967) , “property rights
‘are not the sole measure of Fourth Amendment
violations.’ ” Florida v. Jardines, 569 U. S.
1 , ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3). But as we have recently made
clear, “[t]he Katz reasonable-expectations test ‘has
been added to, not substituted for,’ the traditional
property-based understanding of the Fourth Amendment.” Id.,at
___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting United States v. Jones, 565
U. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8)). I would therefore
find this a more difficult case if it were established that
prop-erty law did not give petitioner’s cotenant the right to
admit visitors over petitioner’s objection. That difficulty
does not arise, however, because the authorities cited by the
amicus association fail to establish that a guest would commit a
trespass if one of two joint tenants invited the guest to enter and
the other tenant forbade the guest to do so. Indeed, what limited
authority there is on the subject points to the opposite
conclusion. See, e.g., 86 C. J. S., Tenancy in Common
§144, p. 354 (2006) (a licensee of one tenant “is not
liable in trespass to nonconsenting cotenants”); Dinsmore v.
Renfroe, 66 Cal. App. 207, 212–214, 225 P. 886, 888–889
(1924); Buchanan v. Jencks, 38 R. I. 443, 446–451, 96 A.
307, 309–311 (1916) (and cases cited therein); cf. 2 H.
Tiffany, Real Property §457, p. 274 (3d ed. 1939) (endorsing
the opposite view but acknowledging that “there is little
authority” on the question). There accordingly is no basis
for us to conclude that the police infringed on any property right
of petitioner’s when they entered the premises with his
cotenant’s consent.
