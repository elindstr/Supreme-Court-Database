															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 20–1800

															_________________

															HAROLD SHURTLEFF, et al., PETITIONERS v. CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit

															[May 2, 2022]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															This dispute arose only because of a government official’s mistaken understanding of the Establishment Clause.  A Boston official believed that the City would violate the Establishment Clause if it allowed a religious flag to briefly fly outside of City Hall as part of the flag-raising program that the City had opened to the public.  So Boston granted requests to fly a variety of secular flags, but denied a request to fly a religious flag.  As this Court has repeatedly made clear, however, a government does not violate the Establishment Clause merely because it treats religious persons, organizations, and speech equally with secular persons, organizations, and speech in public programs, benefits, facilities, and the like.  See, e.g., Zelman v.  Simmons-Harris,

536 U.S. 639 (2002).  On the contrary, a government violates the Constitution when (as here) it excludes religious persons, organizations, or speech because of religion from public programs, benefits, facilities, and the like.  See, e.g., Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, 591 U. S. ___ (2020); Good News Club v. Milford Central School,

533 U.S. 98 (2001); McDaniel v. Paty,

435 U.S. 618 (1978).  Under the Constitution, a government may not treat religious persons, religious organizations, or religious speech as second-class.
