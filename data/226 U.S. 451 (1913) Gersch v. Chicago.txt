U.S. Supreme CourtGersch v. Chicago, 226 U.S. 451 (1913)
Gersch v. Chicago
No. 474
Submitted December 1, 1912
Decided January 6, 1913
226 U.S. 451

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT
OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
Syllabus 

															Where the record doe not contain the final judgment to which the writ of error is directed, this Court cannot assume that a judgment was entered, and is without authority to exert jurisdiction.

															The facts are stated in the opinion.

															Memorandum opinion, by direction of the Court, by MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE:

															This is a companion case to Preston v. City of Chicago, No.195, just disposed of.  Unlike the record in the Preston case, however, the record in this case does not contain the final judgment to which the writ of error is directed.  As we cannot assume that a judgment was in fact entered in the Supreme Court of Illinois, it results that we are without authority to exert jurisdiction.

															Writ of error dismissed.
