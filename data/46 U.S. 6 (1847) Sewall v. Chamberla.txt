U.S. Supreme Court
Sewall v. Chamberlain, 46 U.S. 5 How.
6 6 (1847)
Sewall v. Chamberlain
46 U.S. (5 How.) 6
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF
THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF
ALABAMA
Syllabus

															Where the prayer of a bill in equity shows that the demand of
the complainant is susceptible of definite computation, and that
there can be no recovery over the sum of two thousand dollars, the
appeal to this Court will be dismissed on motion for want of
jurisdiction.

															The facts in the case are sufficiently set forth in the opinion
of the Court.

															MR. JUSTICE WAYNE delivered the opinion of the Court.

															This cause having been regularly docketed, the appellee now
moves the court to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that the
amount in controversy is not large enough to bring the case within
the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

															We have examined the record and find it to be so. By the
averments in the complainant's bill, it seems that the subject
matter in controversy between himself and the defendant relates to
the foreclosure of a mortgage given to the complainant by one
Stephen Chandler, upon a lot of land in the City of Mobile, to
secure the payment of a promissory note made by Chandler in his
favor, bearing date 6 August, 1824, for $485, payable on 1 March
thereafter, which was not paid at maturity, for the collection of
which the complainant made the defendant his attorney and agent;
also to the purchase of the premises, under a decree for

															Page 46 U. S. 7

															its sale, by the defendant, for one hundred and fifty dollars.
The decree of foreclosure, was for the sum of six hundred and
twenty dollars ninety-one cents, and the complainant avers that the
lot was a valid and sufficient security for the payment of his
debt.

															After setting out all the circumstances of his case, and
specially interrogating the defendant, the complainant's prayer is
that the matter may be

															"referred to a master, to compute and report the amount found
due your orator by the foreclosure decree, with the interest
thereon, and also to compute and report the value of the mortgaged
lot, and its value at the time it was sold and conveyed by the
defendant to one Samuel P. Bullard (who is admitted by the
complainant to be a bona fide purchaser of the lot from
the defendant, without any notice of the complainant's equity), and
that the defendant may be decreed to pay, either the amount of the
said decree of foreclosure, and interest on the value of said lot
of land, or the amount received by the defendant from the sale to
Bullard, if the same were sold for its fair and full value, with
all the profits and increase since made by the use of the money, or
legal interest thereon, without any deduction of commissions for
agency."

															From this prayer, the complainant's demand is susceptible of
definite computation, and as his recovery could not be extended to
an amount above his first or alternative prayer, if the recovery in
either case must be below the sum of two thousand dollars, as it
would have to be upon his own showing, this Court cannot have
appellate jurisdiction of the cause.

															We shall direct the dismission of the appeal.
Order

															This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern
District of Alabama, and was argued by counsel. On consideration
whereof, and it appearing to the Court here that the matter in
dispute does not exceed the sum or value of two thousand dollars,
exclusive of costs, it is therefore now here ordered and decreed by
this Court, that this appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed
for the want of jurisdiction.
