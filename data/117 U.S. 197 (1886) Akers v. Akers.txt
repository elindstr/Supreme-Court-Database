															MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The order remanding this cause is affirmed on the authority of Gibson v. Bruce, 108 U. S. 561, it being admitted that both the plaintiff and the defendant were citizens of Tennessee at the time the suit was brought.
