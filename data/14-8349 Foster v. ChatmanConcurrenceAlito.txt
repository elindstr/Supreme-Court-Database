															TIMOTHY TYRONE FOSTER, PETITIONER v. BRUCE CHATMAN, WARDEN

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of georgia

															[May 23, 2016]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment.

															I agree with the Court that the decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia cannot be affirmed and that the case must be remanded.  I write separately to explain my understanding of the role of state law in the proceedings that must be held on remand.

															I

															As the Court recounts, in August 1986, Queen Madge White, a 79-year-old retired schoolteacher, was sexually assaulted and brutally murdered in her home in Rome, Georgia.  Her home was ransacked, and various household items were stolen.  Foster v. State, 258 Ga. 736, 374 S. E. 2d 188 (1988).  About a month after the murder, police officers were called to respond to a local disturbance.  The complainant, Lisa Stubbs, told them that her boyfriend, petitioner Timothy Foster, had killed White and had distributed the goods stolen from White’s home to Stubbs and family members.  Tr. 1719–1723.  Officers arrested Foster, who confessed to the murder and robbery, 258 Ga., at 736, 374 S. E. 2d, at 190, and the police recovered some of the stolen goods.

															Foster was put on trial for White’s murder, convicted, and sentenced to death.  Before, during, and after his trial, Foster argued that the prosecution violated his rights under this Court’s then-recent decision in Batson v. Kentucky,

476 U. S. 79 (1986)
, by peremptorily challenging all the prospective jurors who were black.  After the Georgia Supreme Court rejected Foster’s Batson argument on direct appeal, he filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this Court, but his petition did not raise a Batson claim,[1] and the petition was denied.  Foster v. Georgia,

490 U. S. 1085 (1989)
.

															In July 1989, Foster filed a state habeas petition in the Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia.  For the next 10 years, most of Foster’s claims (including his Batson claim) were held in abeyance while the Georgia courts adjudi-cated Foster’s claim that he is “mentally retarded” and thus cannot be executed under Georgia law.  Zant v. Foster, 261 Ga. 450, 406 S. E. 2d 74 (1991).  After extensive court proceedings, including two visits to the State Supreme Court,[2] additional petitions for certiorari to this Court,[3] and a jury trial on the issue of intellectual disability, Foster was denied relief on that claim.  He then amended his habeas petition, and the Superior Court considered the many other claims asserted in his petition, including his Batson claim.  In support of that claim, Foster offered new evidence, namely, the prosecution’s jury selection notes, which he had obtained through a Georgia open-records request.  These notes showed that someone had highlighted the names of black jurors and had written the letter “B” next to their names.

															The Superior Court issued a written decision in which it evaluated Foster’s habeas claims.  The opinion began by noting that many of his claims were barred by res judi-cata.  The opinion stated: “[T]his court notes . . . that the following claims are not reviewable based on the doctrine of res judicata, as the claims were raised and litigated adversely to the petitioner on his direct appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.”  App. 175.  Included in the list of barred claims was “Petitioner[’s] alleg[ation] that the State used peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of Batson.”  Id., at 175–176.

															Later in its opinion, the Superior Court again referred to the Batson claim and wrote as follows:

															“The Respondent argues that this claim is not reviewable due to the doctrine of res judicata.  However, because the Petitioner claims that additional evidence allegedly supporting this ground was discovered subsequent to the Georgia Supreme Court’s ruling in Foster v. State, 258 Ga. 736 (1988) [the decision affirming Foster’s conviction on direct appeal], this court will review the Batson claim as to whether Petitioner has shown any change in the facts sufficient to overcome the res judicata bar.”  Id., at 192.

															The court then reviewed the evidence and concluded that it “[could not] find that the highlighting of the names of black jurors and the notation of their race can serve to override this previous consideration [on direct appeal].”  Id., at 193.  Because “all jurors in this case, regardless of race, were thoroughly investigated and considered before the State exercised its peremptory challenges,” the court found that “Petitioner fail[ed] to demonstrate purposeful discrimination on the basis that the race of prospective jurors was either circled, highlighted or otherwise noted on various lists.”  Id., at 195.  Thus, the court held that the Batson claim was “without merit.”  App. 196.

															Foster subsequently sought review of the Superior Court’s decision in the Georgia Supreme Court, but that court refused to issue a certificate of probable cause (CPC) to appeal.  In its entirety, the State Supreme Court order states:

															“Upon consideration of the Application for Certificate of Probable Cause to appeal the denial of habeas corpus, it is ordered that it be hereby denied.  All the Justices concur, except Benham, J., who dissents.”  Id., at 246.

															Foster sought review of this decision, and this Court granted certiorari to review the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court.  575 U. S. ___ (2015).

															II

															The decision of the Georgia Supreme Court was a decision on the merits of Foster’s Batson claim, as presented in his state habeas petition.  See Ga. Sup. Ct. Rule 36 (2016) (a CPC to appeal a final judgment in a habeas corpus case involving a criminal conviction “will be issued where there is arguable merit”); Hittson v. Warden, 759 F. 3d 1210, 1232 (CA11 2014) (The Georgia Supreme Court’s standard for denying a CPC “clearly constitutes an adjudication on the merits”).  Thus, what the Georgia Supreme Court held was that Foster’s Batson claim, as presented in his state habeas petition, lacked arguable merit.

															That holding was likely based at least in part on state law.  As noted, the Superior Court quite clearly held that Foster’s Batson claim was barred by res judicata.  That conclusion, to be sure, was not entirely divorced from the merits of his federal constitutional claim, since the court went on to discuss the evidence advanced by petitioner in support of his argument that the prosecution’s strikes of black members of the venire were based on race.  Rather, it appears that the Superior Court understood state law to permit Foster to obtain reconsideration of his previously rejected Batson claim only if he was able to show that a “change in the facts” was “sufficient to overcome the res judicata bar.”  App. 192.

															In concluding that Foster’s renewed Batson claim was required to meet a heightened standard, the Superior Court appears to have been following established Georgia law.  Some Georgia cases seem to stand for the proposition that the bar is absolute, at least in some circumstances.  See, e.g., Roulain v. Martin, 266 Ga. 353, 466 S. E. 2d 837, 839 (1996) (“Since this issue was raised and resolved in Martin’s direct appeal, it should not have been readdressed by the habeas court”); Davis v. Thomas, 261 Ga. 687, 689, 410 S. E. 2d 110, 112 (1991) (“This issue was raised on direct appeal, and this court determined that it had no merit.  Davis recognizes the principle that one who had an issue decided adversely to him on direct appeal is precluded from relitigating that issue on habeas corpus”); Gunter v. Hickman, 256 Ga. 315, 316, 348 S. E. 2d 644, 645 (1986) (“This issue was actually litigated, i.e., raised and decided, in the appellant’s direct appeal . . . . For this reason, the issue cannot be reasserted in habeas-corpus proceedings”); Elrod v. Ault, 231 Ga. 750, 204 S. E. 2d 176 (1974) (“After an appellate review the same issues will not be reviewed on habeas corpus”).  Other decisions, however, allow a defendant to overcome res judicata if he can produce newly discovered evidence that was not “reasonably available” to him on direct review.  Gibson v. Head, 282 Ga. 156, 159, 646 S. E. 2d 257, 260 (2007); see also Gibson v. Ricketts, 244 Ga. 482, 483, 260 S. E. 2d 877, 878 (1979).[4]

															In restricting the relitigation of previously rejected claims, Georgia is not alone.  “[W]e have long and consistently affirmed that a collateral challenge may not do service for an appeal.”  United States v. Frady,

456 U. S. 152,
165 (1982)
.  Accordingly, at least as a general rule, federal prisoners may not use a motion under

28 U. S. C. §2255 to relitigate a claim that was previously rejected on direct appeal.  See, e.g., Reed v. Farley,

512 U. S. 339,
358 (1994)
 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“[C]laims will ordinarily not be entertained under §2255 that have already been rejected on direct review”); Withrow v. Williams,

507 U. S. 680,
721 (1993)
 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“[A]bsent countervailing considerations, district courts may refuse to reach the merits of a constitutional claim previously raised and rejected on direct appeal”); United States v. Lee, 715 F. 3d 215, 224 (CA8 2013); Rozier v. United States, 701 F. 3d 681, 684 (CA11 2012); United States v. Roane, 378 F. 3d 382, 396, n. 7 (CA4 2004); United States v. Webster, 392 F. 3d 787, 791 (CA5 2004); White v. United States, 371 F. 3d 900, 902 (CA7 2004); United States v. Jones, 918 F. 2d 9, 10–11 (CA2 1990); United States v. Prichard, 875 F. 2d 789, 790–791 (CA10 1989).  Cf. Davis v. United States,

417 U. S. 333,
342 (1974)
.  As we have said, “[i]t has, of course, long been settled law that an error that may justify reversal on direct appeal will not necessarily support a collateral attack on a final judgment.  The reasons for narrowly limiting the grounds for collateral attack on final judgments are well known and basic to our adversary system of justice.”  United States v. Addonizio,

442 U. S. 178,
184 (1979)
 (footnote omitted).

															In accordance with this principle, federal law provides that a state prisoner may not relitigate a claim that was rejected in a prior federal habeas petition.  See 28 U. S. C. §§2244(b)(1)–(3).  And even when a state prisoner’s second or successive federal habeas petition asserts a new federal constitutional claim based on what is asserted to be new evidence, the claim must be dismissed unless a very demanding test is met.  See §2244(b)(2)(B) (“[T]he factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence”; and the facts must “be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that . . . no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty”).

															“[T]he principle of finality” is “essential to the operation of our criminal justice system.”  Teague v. Lane,

489 U. S. 288,
309 (1989)
 (plurality opinion).  Thus, once a criminal conviction becomes final—as Foster’s did 30 years ago—state courts need not remain open indefinitely to relitigate claims related to that conviction which were raised and decided on direct review.  States are under no obligation to permit collateral attacks on convictions that have become final, and if they allow such attacks, they are free to limit the circumstances in which claims may be relitigated.

															To the extent that the decision of the Georgia Supreme Court was based on a state rule restricting the relitigation of previously rejected claims, the decision has a state-law component, and we have no jurisdiction to review a state court’s decision on a question of state law.  See

28 U. S. C. §1257(a).  This Court, no less than every other federal court, has “an independent obligation to ensure that [we] do not exceed the scope of [our] jurisdiction, and therefore [we] must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.”  Henderson v. Shinseki,

562 U. S. 428,
434 (2011)
.

															III

															“This Court long has held that it will not consider an issue of federal law on direct review from a judgment of a state court if that judgment rests on a state-law ground that is both ‘independent’ of the merits of the federal claim and an ‘adequate’ basis for the court’s decision,” Harris v. Reed, 

489 U. S. 255,
260 (1989)
, and like the Court (and both petitioner and respondent) I agree that we cannot conclude from the brief order issued by the Supreme Court of Georgia that its decision was based wholly on state law.  It is entirely possible that the State Supreme Court reached a conclusion about the effect of the state res judicata bar based in part on as assessment of the strength of Foster’s Batson claim or the extent to which the new evidence bolstered that claim.  And if that is what the State Supreme Court held, the rule that the court applied was an amalgam of state and federal law.

															By the same token, however, the state-law res judicata rule applied by the Superior Court is clearly not like the rule in Ake v. Oklahoma,

470 U. S. 68 (1985)
, which appears to have been entirely dependent on federal law.  In Ake, a prisoner argued that due process entitled him to obtain the services of a psychiatrist in order to prove that he was insane at the time when he committed a murder.  The Oklahoma courts concluded that Ake’s claim was waived, but the Oklahoma waiver rule essentially made an exception for any case in which there was a violation of a fundamental federal constitutional right.  See id., at 74–75 (“The Oklahoma waiver rule does not apply to fundamental trial error,” including “federal constitutional errors [that] are ‘fundamental’ ”).  Thus, the state waiver rule was entirely dependent on federal law, and this Court therefore held that it had jurisdiction to review the underlying constitutional question—whether Ake was entitled to a psychiatrist.  Then, having found a constitu-tional violation, the Court remanded for a new trial.  Id., at 86–87.

															The res judicata rule applied by the Superior Court in this case is quite different.  That court obviously did not think that Georgia law included an Ake-like exception that would permit a defendant to overcome res judicata simply by making the kind of showing of federal constitutional error that would have been sufficient when the claim was first adjudicated.  Accordingly, Ake does not mean that we can simply disregard the possibility that the decision under review may have a state-law component.

															Our cases chart the path that we must follow in a situation like the one present here.  When “a state court’s interpretation of state law has been influenced by an accompanying interpretation of federal law,” the proper course is for this Court to “revie[w] the federal question on which the state-law determination appears to have been premised.  If the state court has proceeded on an incorrect perception of federal law, it has been this Court’s practice to vacate the judgment of the state court and remand the case so that the court may reconsider the state-law question free of misapprehensions about the scope of federal law.”  Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C.,

467 U. S. 138,
152 (1984)
.  See also S. Shapiro, K. Geller, T. Bishop, E. Hartnett, & D. Himmelfarb, Supreme Court Practice 212 (10th ed. 2013).  In a situation like the one presented here, the correct approach is for us to decide the question of federal law and then to remand the case to the state court so that it can reassess its decision on the state-law question in light of our decision on the underlying federal issue.[5]

															IV

															I agree with the Court that the totality of the evidence now adduced by Foster is sufficient to make out a Batson violation.  On remand, the Georgia Supreme Court is bound to accept that evaluation of the federal question, but whether that conclusion justifies relief under state res judicata law is a matter for that court to decide.

															Compliance with Batson is essential to ensure that defendants receive a fair trial and to preserve the public confidence upon which our system of criminal justice depends.  But it is also important that this Court respect the authority of state courts to structure their systems of postconviction review in a way that promotes the expeditious and definitive disposition of claims of error.

															Until recently, this Court rarely granted review of state-court decisions in collateral review proceedings, preferring to allow the claims adjudicated in such proceedings to be decided first in federal habeas proceedings.  See Lawrence v. Florida,

549 U. S. 327,
335 (2007)
 (“[T]his Court rarely grants review at this stage of the litigation even when the application for state collateral relief is supported by arguably meritorious federal constitutional claims, choosing instead to wait for federal habeas proceedings” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Kyles v. Whitley,

498 U. S. 931,
932 (1990)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in denial of stay of execution); Huffman v. Florida,

435 U. S. 1014
–1018 (1978) (Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari).  When cases reach this Court after habeas review in the lower federal courts, the standards of review set out in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,

28 U. S. C. §2254, apply.  Recently, this Court has evidenced a predilection for granting review of state-court decisions denying postconviction relief, see, e.g., Wearry v. Cain, 577 U. S. __ (2016) (per curiam).  Particularly in light of that trend, it is important that we do not lightly brush aside the States’ legitimate interest in structuring their systems of postconviction review in a way that militates against repetitive litigation and endless delay.Notes

		 Georgia res judicata law may also include a “miscarriage of justice” exception, but that appears to capture only the exceptionally rare claim of actual innocence, and so is not at issue here.  See Walker v. Penn, 271 Ga. 609, 611, 523 S. E. 2d 325, 327 (1999) (“The term miscarriage of justice is by no means to be deemed synonymous with procedural irregularity, or even with reversible error.  To the contrary, it demands a much greater substance, approaching perhaps the imprisonment of one who, not only is not guilty of the specific offense for which he is convicted, but, further, is not even culpable in the circumstances under inquiry.  (A plain example is a case of mistaken identity)” (brackets omitted)).

		 The Court relies on Ake solely for the proposition, with which I agree, that we have jurisdiction to review the federal question whether the totality of the circumstances (that is, all the facts brought to the attention of the state courts on direct appeal and collateral review) make out a Batson claim.  Ante, at 9, n. 4.  Thus, the Court does not preclude consideration of state law issues on remand.  See ante, at 25.
