															HOSANNA-TABOR EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH AND SCHOOL, PETITIONER v. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[January 11, 2012]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion.  I write separately to note that, in my view, the Religion Clauses require civil courts to apply the ministerial exception and to defer to a religious organization’s good-faith understanding of who qualifies as its minister.  As the Court explains, the Religion Clauses guarantee religious organizations autonomy in matters of internal governance, including the selection of those who will minister the faith.  A religious organi-zation’s right to choose its ministers would be hollow, however, if secular courts could second-guess the organiza-tion’s sincere determination that a given employee is a “minister” under the organization’s theological tenets.  Our country’s religious landscape includes organizations with different leadership structures and doctrines that influence their conceptions of ministerial status.  The question whether an employee is a minister is itself religious in nature, and the answer will vary widely.  Judicial attempts to fashion a civil definition of “minister” through a bright-line test or multi-factor analysis risk disadvantaging those religious groups whose beliefs, practices, and membership are outside of the “mainstream” or  unpalatable to some.  Moreover, uncertainty about whether its ministerial designation will be rejected, and a corresponding fear of liability, may cause a religious group to conform its beliefs and practices regarding “ministers” to the prevailing secular understanding.  See Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos,

483 U.S. 327, 336 (1987) (“[I]t is a significant burden on a religious organization to require it, on pain of substantial liability, to predict which of its activities a secular court will consider religious.  The line is hardly a bright one, and an organization might understandably be concerned that a judge would not understand its religious tenets and sense of mission.  Fear of potential liability might affect the way an organization carried out what it understood to be its religious mission” (footnote omitted)).  These are certainly dangers that the
 
First Amendment was designed to guard against.

															The Court thoroughly sets forth the facts that lead to its conclusion that Cheryl Perich was one of Hosanna-Tabor’s ministers, and I agree that these facts amply demonstrate Perich’s ministerial role.  But the evidence demonstrates that Hosanna-Tabor sincerely considered Perich a minister.  That would be sufficient for me to conclude that Per-ich’s suit is properly barred by the ministerial exception.
