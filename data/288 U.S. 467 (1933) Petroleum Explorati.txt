															Certiorari, 287 U.S. 592, to review the reversal of an order of the Board of Tax Appeals, 23 B.T.A. 890, overruling a deficiency assessment of income tax.

															MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

															Petitioner, a Maine corporation, in making its tax returns of income derived from the operation of oil wells in the years 1925, 1926, and 1927, claimed a deduction from gross income of a depreciation allowance on account of the capitalized costs of drilling the oil wells.  The Commissioner refused to allow the deductions, and assessed a corresponding deficiency against the taxpayer.  On appeal, the Board of Tax Appeals held that the deductions should have been allowed.  23 B.T.A. 890.  On petition for review, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the order of the Board.  61 F.2d 273.  The court held that the deductions claimed were included in the depletion allowance fixed by ยง 234(a)(8) of the Revenue Act of 1926 at 27 1/2 percent of petitioner's gross income for the years in question, and could not be allowed as depreciation of improvements.  This Court granted certiorari to resolve a conflict of the decision below with that of the

															Affirmed.
