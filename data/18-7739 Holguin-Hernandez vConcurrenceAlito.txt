															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															GONZALO HOLGUIN-HERNANDEZ, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[February 26, 2020]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring.

															I agree with the Court that a defendant who requests a specific sentence during a sentencing hearing need not object to the sentence after its pronouncement in order to preserve a challenge to its substantive reasonableness (i.e., length) on appeal.  I write to emphasize what we are not deciding.

															First, we do not decide “what is sufficient to preserve a claim that a trial court used improper procedures in arriving at its chosen sentence.”  Ante, at 6.  That question is not currently before us.  Nevertheless, as we have previously explained, failing to object at all to a procedural error (e.g., a district court’s miscalculation of the Guidelines range) will subject a procedural challenge to plain-error review.  Molina-Martinez v. United States, 578 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op., at 4).

															Second, we do not decide what is sufficient to preserve any “particular” substantive-reasonableness argument.  Ante, at 6.  Again, the question here “is simply whether the claimed error was ‘brought to the court’s attention.’ ”  Ante, at 5 (quoting Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b)).  Thus, we do not suggest that a generalized argument in favor of less imprisonment will insulate all arguments regarding the length of a sentence from plain-error review.  The plain-error rule serves many interests, judicial efficiency and finality being chief among them.  See Puckett v. United States,

556 U.S. 129, 134–135 (2009).  Requiring a party to bring an error to the attention of the court enables the court to correct itself, obviating the need for an appeal.  At the very least, the court can explain its reasoning and thus assist the appellate process.  A court cannot address particular arguments or facts not brought to its attention.

															Third, we do not decide whether this petitioner properly preserved his particular substantive-reasonableness arguments, namely, that he did not pose a danger to the public and that a 12-month sentence would not serve deterrence purposes.  See ante, at 2, 5–6.  In determining whether arguments have been preserved, courts should make a case-specific assessment of how the error was “brought to the court’s attention.”  Rule 52(b); see also, e.g., United States v. Vonner, 516 F.3d 382, 392 (CA6) (en banc) (“While we do not require defendants to challenge the ‘reasonableness’ of their sentences in front of the district court, we surely should apply plain-error review to any arguments for leniency that the defendant does not present to the trial court”), cert. denied,

555 U.S. 816 (2008).  On remand, the Fifth Circuit can decide whether petitioner preserved these specific arguments and whether the sentence was substantively unreasonable.
