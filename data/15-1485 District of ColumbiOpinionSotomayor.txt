															DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al., PETITIONERS v. THEODORE WESBY, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

															[January 22, 2018]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I agree with the majority that the officers here are entitled to qualified immunity and, for that reason alone, I concur in the Court’s judgment reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  But, I disagree with the majority’s decision to reach the merits of the probable-cause question, which it does apparently only to ensure that, in addition to respondents’

42 U. S. C. §1983 claims, the Court’s decision will resolve respondents’ state-law claims of false arrest and negligent su- pervision.  See ante, at 13, n. 7.  It is possible that our qualified-immunity decision alone will resolve those claims.  See Reply Brief 20, n. 7.  In light of the lack of a dispute on an important legal question and the heavily factbound nature of the probable-cause determination here, I do not think that the Court should have reached that issue.  The lower courts are well equipped to handle the remaining state-law claims in the first instance.
