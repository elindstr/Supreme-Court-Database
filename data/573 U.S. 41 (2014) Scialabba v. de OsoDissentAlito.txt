															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															LORI SCIALABBA, ACTING DIRECTOR, UNITEDSTATES
CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES, et al., PETITIONERS v.
ROSA-LINA CUELLAR DE OSORIO et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 9, 2014]

															     Justice Alito,
dissenting.

															     I agree with many of
Justice Sotomayor’s criticismsof the plurality opinion. I
also agree with The Chief Justice’s critique of the
plurality’s suggestion that, when two halves of a statute
“do not easily cohere with each other,” an agency
administering the statute is free to decide which half it will
obey. Ante, at 14. After all, “[d]irect conflict is not
ambiguity, and the resolution of such conflict is not statutory
construction but legislative choice.” Ante, at 2 (Roberts,
C. J., concurring in judgment). While I, like Justice
Sotomayor, would affirm the Court of Appeals, my justification for
doing so differs somewhat from hers.

															     As I see it, the
question before us is whether there is or is not an
“appropriate category” to which the petitions for
respondents’ children may be converted. If there is, the
agency was obligated by the clear text of 8 U. S. C.
§1153(h)(3) to convert the petitions and leave the children
with their original priority dates. Any such conversion would be
“automatic,” because the agency’s obligation to
convert the petitions follows inexorably, and without need for any
additional action on the part of either respondents or their
children, from the fact that the children’s ages have been
calculated to be 21 or older.[1] If there is not an appropriate category, then the
agency was not required to convert the petitions.

															     By the time respondents
became legal permanent residents and filed new petitions for their
children (if not sooner), there existed an appropriate category to
which the original petitions could be converted. That is because at
that point the children all qualified for F2B preference status, as
unmarried, adult children of legal permanent residents.
Accordingly, the agency should have converted respondents’
children’s petitions and allowed them to retain their
original priority dates.[2]

															     Section 1153(h)(3) is
brief and cryptic. It may well contain a great deal of ambiguity,
which the Board of Immigration Appeals in its expertise is free to
resolve, so long as its resolution is a “permissible
construction of the statute.” Chevron U. S. A. Inc.
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843
(1984) . But the statute is clear on at least one point: “If
the age of an alien is determined under [§1153(h)(1)] to be 21
years of age or older . . . , the alien’s petition
shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and
the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon
receipt of the original petition” (emphasis added). The Board
was not free to disregard this clear statutory command.

Notes
1
 I do not believe the term
“converted” demands the interpretationthe plurality
gives it, for the reasons advanced in ’s dissenting
opinion.
2
 The Government does not
argue that respondents’ children were ineligible for relief
because, as a factual matter, their ages were never
“determined . . . to be 21 years of age or
older,” §1153(h)(3), after an appropriate category
became available. I therefore do not opine on this
issue.
