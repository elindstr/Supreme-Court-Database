															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															WILLIAM P. BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL, et al., PETITIONERS v. AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF POLITICAL CONSULTANTS, INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[July 6, 2020]

															

															Justice Sotomayor, concurring in the judgment.

															I agree with much of the partial dissent’s explanation that strict scrutiny should not apply to all content-based distinctions.  Cf. post, at 5–9 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment with respect to severability and dissenting in part).  In my view, however, the government-debt exception in

47 U. S. C. §227(b) still fails intermediate scrutiny because it is not “narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.”  Ward v. Rock Against Racism,

491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Even under intermediate scrutiny, the Government has not explained how a debt-collection robocall about a government-backed debt is any less intrusive or could be any less harassing than a debt-collection robocall about a privately backed debt.  As the Fourth Circuit noted, the government-debt exception is seriously underinclusive because it permits “many of the intrusive calls that the automated call ban was enacted to prohibit.”  American Assn. of Political Consultants, Inc. v. FCC, 923 F.3d 159, 168 (2019) (case below).  The Government could have employed far less restrictive means to further its interest in collecting debt, such as “secur[ing] consent from the debtors to make debt-collection calls” or “plac[ing] the calls itself.”  Id., at 169, n. 10; see also §227(b)(1)(A).  Nor has the Government “sufficiently justified the differentiation between government-debt collection speech and other important categories of robocall speech, such as political speech, charitable fundraising, issue advocacy, commercial advertising, and the like.”  Ante, at 9.

															Nevertheless, I agree that the offending provision is severable.  See ante, at 2; post, at 11–12 (opinion of Breyer, J.); see also City of Ladue v. Gilleo,

512 U.S. 43, 51–53 (1994) (explaining that an appropriate “solution” to a law that covers “too little speech because its exemptions discriminate on the basis of [the speaker’s] messages” could be to “remove” the discrimination).

															With those understandings, I concur in the judgment.
