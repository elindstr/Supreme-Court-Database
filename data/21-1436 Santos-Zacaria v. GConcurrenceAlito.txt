															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–1436

															_________________

															LEON SANTOS-ZACARIA aka LEON SANTOS-SACARIAS,
PETITIONER v. MERRICK B. GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[May 11, 2023]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring in judgment.

															I agree with the Court that 8 U. S. C.
§1252(d)(1) does not require the filing of a motion for
reconsideration under the circumstances presented here. That
provision requires the exhaustion of those administrative remedies
that are “available to [an] alien as of right,” but the
decision to grant reconsideration is discretionary. 8 CFR
§1003.2(a) (2022). Because that determination disposes of this
case, I would not decide whether §1252(d)(1) is jurisdictional
with respect to the administrative remedies to which it does
apply.
