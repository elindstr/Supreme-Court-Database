															MOAC MALL HOLDINGS LLC, PETITIONER v.
TRANSFORM HOLDCO LLC, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[April 19, 2023]

															

															Justice Jackson delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Under conditions prescribed by Congress, the
Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor (or a trustee) to sell or lease
the bankruptcy estate’s property outside of the ordinary
course of the bankrupt entity’s business. 11
U. S. C. §363(b). Interested parties may file an
objection to such a sale or lease, and may appeal if the court
authorizes a sale or lease of the estate’s property over
their objection. But §363(m) restricts the effect of such an
appeal, if successful.

															Specifically, §363(m) states that

															“[t]he reversal or modification on
appeal of an authorization under [§363(b) or §363(c)] of
a sale or lease of property does not affect the validity of a sale
or lease under such authorization to an entity that purchased or
leased such property in good faith, whether or not such entity knew
of the pendency of the appeal, unless such authorization and such
sale or lease were stayed pending appeal.”

															Accordingly, sometimes, a successful appeal of a
judicial authorization to sell or lease estate property will not
impugn the validity of a sale or lease made under that
authorization.

															In this case, we are called upon to decide
whether §363(m)’s strictures are jurisdictional. If so,
a party may invoke that provision at any time—without fear of
waiver, forfeiture, or similar doctrines interposing. If not,
courts can apply such doctrines when evaluating §363(m)
issues, where appropriate. For the reasons explained below, we
conclude that §363(m) is not a jurisdictional provision.

															I

															This saga began in 2018, when Sears, Roebuck
and Co. (Sears) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That filing
created a bankruptcy estate that included (with exceptions not
relevant here) “interests of the debtor in property.”
§541(a)(1). Such an estate is sometimes administered by a
bankruptcy trustee; other times the debtor itself administers it as
the “debtor in possession.” §§1101, 1107; see
Mission Product Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology, LLC,
587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 2). Sears
self-administered, and as a debtor in possession, Sears had
statutorily qualified powers to dispose of the estate’s
property. §§1101, 1107, 363.

															Early in 2019, Sears exercised one of those
powers: its right to “use, sell, or lease, other than in the
ordinary course of business, property of the estate.”
§363(b)(1). Sears agreed to sell most of its assets to
respondent Transform Holdco LLC (Transform), after which the
Bankruptcy Court issued an order (Sale Order) approving the
agreement.

															Among the assets conveyed in that sale was the
right for Transform to “designate to whom a lease between
Sears . . . and some landlord should be assigned.”
In re Sears Holdings Corp., 616 B.R. 615, 619 (SDNY
2020) (Sears II). The agreement did not actually
designate any assignees; it simply meant that, if Transform duly
designated an assignee, Sears had to assign the lease to the
designee. One of the leases eligible for such assignment was
Sears’s lease with petitioner MOAC Mall Holdings LLC, which
leases spaces to tenants at the Minnesota Mall of America.

															Notably, and as relevant here, §365 of the
Code prohibits assignment of an unexpired lease to anyone without
“adequate assurance of future performance by the
assignee,” §365(f )(2)(B), and further establishes
special adequate-assurance criteria related to “shopping
center[s],” §365(b)(3), a term the parties agree
describes the Mall of America. In that context, adequate assurance
includes assurances that (1) the proposed assignee has a
“similar . . . financial condition and operating
performance” as the debtor “as of the time the debtor
became the lessee under the lease,” and (2) the assignment
will not “disrupt any tenant mix or balance in [the] shopping
center.” §§365(b)(3)(A), (D).

															Later in 2019, Transform designated the Mall of
America lease for assignment to its wholly owned
subsidiary,[1] and MOAC
objected on the ground that Sears had failed to provide the
requisite adequate assurance of future performance by Transform.
The Bankruptcy Court disagreed and approved the assignment to
Transform, in a decision that, like the lower courts, we will call
the “Assignment Order.”

															Here is where §363(m) entered the picture.
MOAC feared that, if it appealed the Assignment Order, Transform
might argue that §363(m)’s restrictions limited or
barred the appeal.[2] Looking
to §363(m)’s safe harbor for certain orders that are
“stayed pending appeal,” MOAC sought to forestall any
such argument by asking for a stay of the Assignment Order. The
Bankruptcy Court denied MOAC’s request for a stay. The court
reasoned that an appeal of the Assignment Order did not qualify as
an appeal of an authorization described in §363(m), and it
emphasized that Transform had explicitly represented that it would
not invoke §363(m) against MOAC’s appeal. Because no
stay was granted, the Assignment Order became effective, and Sears
duly assigned the lease to Transform.

															MOAC then appealed the Assignment Order to the
District Court, which initially sided with MOAC and concluded that
Transform did not satisfy the pertinent §365
adequate-assurance provisions. It thus vacated the Assignment Order
(as relevant) “to the extent it approved” Sears’s
assignment of the lease to Transform. In re Sears Holdings
Corp., 613 B.R. 51, 79 (SDNY 2020) (Sears I). Transform
sought rehearing and—notably—backed away from its
previous disclaimers, arguing for the first time that §363(m)
deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to grant MOAC’s
requested relief. The District Court was “appalled” by
Transform’s gambit of waiting to invoke §363(m) until
after losing the merits of the appeal, but determined that Second
Circuit precedent bound it to treat §363(m) as jurisdictional,
and thus not subject to “waiver [or] judicial
estoppel.” Sears II, 616 B. R., at 624–625.
The District Court held that §363(m) was applicable and
required it to dismiss the appeal, so it did so, leaving the
Assignment Order unscathed. The Second Circuit affirmed, agreeing
with the District Court’s characterization of §363(m) as
jurisdictional, based on Second Circuit precedent.

															We granted MOAC’s petition for certiorari
to resolve the Circuit split that the Second Circuit’s ruling
reinforced. 597 U. S. ___ (2022).[3] Before this Court, Transform not only defends the
Second Circuit’s characterization of §363(m) as
jurisdictional, but also urges us to dismiss this case on mootness
grounds because the lease has already been transferred out of the
estate via the assignment. Brief for Respondent 19–24.

															II

															We first address Transform’s mootness
claim. A “case becomes moot only when it is impossible for a
court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing
party.” Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S.
165, 172 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). The case
remains live “ ‘[a]s long as the parties have a
concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the
litigation.’ ” Ibid.

															Stripped of its baubles, Transform’s
mootness argument is that MOAC’s ultimate relief hinges on
the Bankruptcy Court’s ability to “reconstitut[e the
leasehold] as property of the estate.” Brief for Respondent
19. Transform asserts that such reconstitution is impossible unless
the leasehold transfer is “avoid[ed]” under 11
U. S. C. §549, which permits a debtor in possession
to void certain transfers of estate property made after the
bankruptcy case commences. But, according to Transform, only Sears
can use §549. And, per Transform, not only did Sears waive any
such avoidance claims in the Sale Order, but the time for using
§549 has now expired. The upshot for Transform’s
mootness argument is that no legal vehicle remains available for
undoing the lease transfer, and therefore MOAC cannot possibly
obtain any effectual relief, irrespective of our answer to the
question presented.

															Our cases disfavor these kinds of mootness
arguments. In Chafin, for example, a mother invoking the
Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child
Abduction sought, and received, an order from a Federal District
Court that her child be returned to Scotland from the United
States, where the child was residing with her father. 568
U. S., at 168–171. The father appealed, seeking reversal
and a concomitant “ ‘re-return’ ”
order, id., at 171, 173, but in the interim the mother had
removed the child to Scotland, so the appellate court dismissed the
father’s appeal as moot. Id., at 171. Before us, the
mother defended the mootness holding on the grounds that the
District Court on remand would lack the authority to “issue a
re-return order either under the Convention or pursuant to its
inherent equitable powers.” Id., at 174. We disagreed.
We said her argument went “to the meaning of the Convention
and the legal availability of a certain kind of relief,” and
thus “confuse[d] mootness with the merits.”
Ibid. And, at least where the father’s contrary
re-return argument was not “so implausible that it [was]
insufficient to preserve jurisdiction,” his “prospects
of success [were] therefore not pertinent to the mootness
inquiry.” Ibid. (citing Steel Co. v.
Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S.
83, 89 (1998)).

															So too here. Like the father in Chafin,
MOAC simply seeks “typical appellate relief: that the Court
of Appeals reverse the District Court and that the District Court
undo what it has done.” 568 U. S., at 173. And we cannot
say that the parties have “no ‘concrete
interest,’ ” id., at 176, in whether MOAC
obtains that relief. Transform’s only retort—which MOAC
vigorously disputes—is simply that any ultimate vacatur of
the Assignment Order will not matter. Chafin forecloses this
kind of argument. Here, as elsewhere, we decline to act as a court
of “ ‘first view,’ ” plumbing the
Code’s complex depths in “ ‘the first
instance’ ” to assure ourselves that Transform is
correct about its contention that no relief remains legally
available. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S.
189, 201 (2012).[4]

															III

															With respect to the question that we granted
certiorari to consider—whether §363(m) is a
jurisdictional provision—our answer is no, for the reasons
that follow.

															A

															Congressional statutes are replete with
directions to litigants that serve as “preconditions to
relief.” Fort Bend County v. Davis, 587
U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 7). Filing deadlines are
classic examples. United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575
U.S. 402, 410 (2015). So are preconditions to suit, like exhaustion
requirements. Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,
559 U.S.
154, 157–158, 166, and n. 6 (2010). So, too, are
“statutory limitation[s] on coverage,” or “on a
statute’s scope,” such as the “element[s] of a
plaintiff ’s claim for relief.” Arbaugh v.
Y & H Corp., 546 U.S.
500, 515–516 (2006). Congress can, if it chooses, make
compliance with such rules “important and mandatory.”
Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S.
428, 435 (2011). But knowing that much does not, in itself,
make such rules jurisdictional. Ibid.

															The “jurisdictional” label is
significant because it carries with it unique and sometimes severe
consequences. An unmet jurisdictional precondition deprives courts
of power to hear the case, thus requiring immediate dismissal.
Hamer v. Neighborhood Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583
U.S. 17, ___–___ (2017) (slip op., at 2–3). And
jurisdictional rules are impervious to excuses like waiver or
forfeiture. Boechler v. Commissioner, 596 U. S.
___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 3). Courts must also raise and
enforce them sua sponte. Fort Bend County, 587
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).

															This case exemplifies why the distinction
between nonjurisdictional and jurisdictional preconditions matters.
In light of Transform’s belated invocation of §363(m),
the District Court stated that, “if ever there were an
appropriate situation for the application of judicial estoppel,
this would be it.” Sears II, 616 B. R., at 627.
But not even such egregious conduct by a litigant could permit the
application of judicial estoppel as against a jurisdictional
rule.

															In view of these consequences and our past
sometimes-loose use of the word “jurisdiction,” we have
endeavored “to bring some discipline” to this area.
Henderson, 562 U. S., at 435. We have clarified that
jurisdictional rules pertain to
“ ‘ “the power of the court rather than
to the rights or obligations of the
parties.” ’ ” Reed Elsevier, 559
U. S., at 161. And we only treat a provision as jurisdictional
if Congress “ ‘clearly states’ ”
as much. Boechler, 596 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at
3).

															This clear-statement rule implements
“Congress’ likely intent” regarding whether
noncompliance with a precondition “governs a
court’s adjudicatory capacity.” Henderson, 562
U. S., at 435–436. We have reasoned that Congress
ordinarily enacts preconditions to facilitate the fair and orderly
disposition of litigation and would not heedlessly give those same
rules an unusual character that threatens to upend that orderly
progress. Wilkins v. United States, 598 U. S.
___, ___–___ (2023) (slip op., at 3–4); Hamer,
583 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (jurisdictional character
is an exception “to the ordinary operation of our adversarial
system”); Fort Bend County, 587 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 7) (noting the sometimes
“ ‘[h]arsh’ ” consequences of
enforcement of jurisdictional rules, including waste of judicial
resources and unfairness to the litigants).

															That said, Congress need not use
“ ‘magic words’ ” to convey its
intent that a statutory precondition be treated as jurisdictional.
Boechler, 596 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).
“ ‘[T]raditional tools of statutory
construction’ ” can reveal a clear statement.
Ibid. But the statement must indeed be clear; it is
insufficient that a jurisdictional reading is
“plausible,” or even “better,” than
nonjurisdictional alternatives. Id., at ___ (slip op., at
6).

															B

															We see nothing in §363(m)’s limits
that purports to “gover[n] a court’s adjudicatory
capacity.” Henderson, 562 U. S., at 435.

															Start with the text. Far from addressing
“ ‘a court’s authority,’ ”
or “ ‘refer[ring] in any way to the jurisdiction
of the district courts,’ ” Fort Bend
County, 587 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), §363(m)
takes as a given the exercise of judicial power over any
authorization under §363(b) or §363(c) (hereinafter
called “covered authorizations”). Indeed, §363(m)
plainly contemplates that appellate courts might “revers[e]
or modif[y]” any covered authorization, with a
proviso: Sometimes, the court’s exercise of power may not
accomplish all the appellant wishes, because the reversal or
modification of a covered authorization may not “affect the
validity of a sale or lease under such authorization” to a
good-faith purchaser or lessee under certain prescribed
circumstances. §363(m). Thus, the provision consists of a
caveated constraint on the effect of a reversal or modification.
And the caveat is itself caveated; §363(m)’s constraints
are simply inapplicable where the sale or lease was made to a
bad-faith purchaser or lessee, or if the sale or lease is stayed
pending appeal, or (for that matter) if the court does something
other than “revers[e]” or “modif[y]” the
authorization. Ibid.

															This is not the stuff of which clear statements
are made. Indeed, we treated similar statutory traits as
“significan[t]” evidence of nonjurisdictional
status in Reed Elsevier, 559 U. S., at 165. In Reed
Elsevier, this Court considered a Copyright Act provision that,
“with certain exceptions,” required
copyright-infringement plaintiffs to show, as a condition to suit,
that the work at issue had been registered. Id., at
157–158. We found that the provision was nonjurisdictional,
and thought it key that the provision expressly envisioned courts
adjudicating some claims even absent registration, id., at
165, since it would have been “at least unusual to ascribe
jurisdictional significance to a condition subject to these sorts
of exceptions,” ibid.

															Similarly, given §363(m)’s clear
expectation that courts will exercise jurisdiction over a covered
authorization, it is surely permissible to read its text as merely
cloaking certain good-faith purchasers or lessees with a targeted
protection of their newly acquired property interest, applicable
even when an appellate court properly exercises jurisdiction. See
Scarborough v. Principi, 541
U.S. 401, 414 (2004) (statutory provision was not
jurisdictional, for it did not speak to the
“ ‘classes of cases’ ” the court
was “competent to adjudicate” but to “proceedings
auxiliary to cases already within that court’s adjudicatory
authority”). In other words, §363(m) reads like a
“statutory limitation,” Arbaugh, 546 U. S.,
at 516, that is tied in some instances to the need for a party to
take “certain procedural steps at certain specified
times” (here, seeking a stay), Henderson, 562
U. S., at 435. And we certainly cannot say that
§363(m)’s “jurisdictional nature” is
“clear ex visceribus verborum,” as we once did
of a statutory provision directing that “ ‘[n]o
court shall have jurisdiction over [a covered]
action,’ ” Rockwell Int’l Corp. v.
United States, 549 U.S.
457, 467–468 (2007).

															Statutory context further clinches the case.
Congress separated §363(m) from the Code provisions that
recognize federal courts’ jurisdiction over bankruptcy
matters. See 28 U. S. C. §§1334(a)–(b),
(e), 157, 158; see also Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515
(emphasizing separation as evidence of nonjurisdictional
status).[5] And §363(m)
does not contain any “clear tie” to the Code’s
plainly jurisdictional provisions. Boechler, 596 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 6). Nor does the Code lack for examples of
such ties: Consider 11 U. S. C. §305(c), which
directs that certain judicial orders are “not reviewable by
appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals” under
§158(d) (the Code provision that recognizes the courts of
appeals’ jurisdiction in bankruptcy matters).[6]

															It also does not suffice that §363(m)
issues directions, as Transform occasionally intimates. We
routinely hold that congressional commands are nonjurisdictional
despite emphatic directives.[7]
Transform seems to ignore the possibility that §363(m)’s
particular “statutory limitation[s],” Arbaugh,
546 U. S., at 516, could be “important” directives
and yet not jurisdictional, Henderson, 562
U. S., at 435. But it is hardly clear to us that
§363(m)’s commands do anything more than that.

															C

															Transform offers two creative retorts, neither
of which excavates a clear statement from §363(m)’s
unassuming text.

															1

															Transform insists that §363(b) sales of
estate assets must proceed under a court’s in rem
jurisdiction, and that courts can only exercise in rem
jurisdiction with respect to a res (including interests like the
leasehold here) over which they have actual or constructive
control. Brief for Respondent 2, 39–40, 42. Appealing to
“traditional principles of in rem
jurisdiction,” Transform reasons that the transfer of a res
to a good-faith purchaser removes it from the bankruptcy estate,
and so from the court’s in rem jurisdiction over
the estate. Id., at 24, 39–40. And it thus concludes
that §363(m) is jurisdictional, because it operates to ensure
that (absent a stay) courts cannot disturb a transfer to a
good-faith purchaser, thereby “confirm[ing]” the
traditional in rem truth that “the bankruptcy
court cannot reach the res, and thus has no basis for the
exercise of in rem jurisdiction over it.”
Id., at 39–40.

															This argument teeters on a contorted framing of
contested general background principles rather than
§363(m)’s text and context (which, as we have said, lack
any clear jurisdictional hue). Moreover, even setting aside
MOAC’s credible retort that traditional in rem
jurisdiction did not necessarily cease when the res left a
court’s custody, Reply Brief 6–9, Transform’s
contentions about §363(m)’s relationship to traditional
in rem jurisdiction merely offer a reason to
think Congress intended §363(m) to be jurisdictional. That,
without more, is not enough. See Boechler, 596 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 6). Transform does not (because it cannot)
deny the paucity of textual or contextual clues indicating a clear
statement of jurisdictional intent. See Part III–B,
supra. And whatever else one might say about
Transform’s clear-statement case, it certainly has not shown
that §363(m)’s supposed alignment with allegedly
pre-existing jurisdictional truths is so powerful that it nullifies
these otherwise compelling nonjurisdictional inferences.

															Section §363(m)’s operation further
derails this bankshot argument. Transform’s assertion is that
§363(m) is jurisdictional because it “confirms” a
traditional truth that bankruptcy courts exercising
in rem jurisdiction cannot touch a res that is
transferred out of the estate. Brief for Respondent 39. But that
sits uncomfortably with §363(m)’s express contemplation
that courts can touch—and affect the validity
of—certain sales or leases (e.g., those made to
bad-faith purchasers) due to reversals or modifications of covered
authorizations even though the property concerned has left the
estate. Consequently, even if §363(m) mirrors traditional
in rem jurisdiction, it does not seem to reflect what
Transform wishes to see.

															What is more, to the extent that a lower court
can act with respect to the res at all, surely it can only do so
while exercising congressionally conferred jurisdiction. Celotex
Corp. v. Edwards, 514 U.S.
300, 307 (1995). Applied here, that principle puts Transform on
the horns of a dilemma. If a court, consistent with §363(m),
issues a judgment affecting a consummated sale’s validity
that draws on any in rem jurisdiction the Code confers
in §1334, that conferral authorizes the exercise of
in rem power with respect to a res that has left the
estate. Section 363(m) could hardly “confirm” a
supposed traditional truth that its concept of jurisdiction
rejects. But if that hypothetical judgment draws on a
non-in rem source of jurisdiction, then
§363(m)’s power source is even further disconnected from
Transform’s contested claims about traditional
in rem jurisdiction.[8] Either way, §363(m) tells a jurisdictional tale
inconsistent with the one Transform needs.

															In the end, then, Transform’s claims about
traditional in rem jurisdiction are red herrings.
Section 363(m) is what matters, and Congress has not clearly stated
that the provision is a limit on judicial power, rather than a mere
restriction on the effects of a valid exercise of that power when a
party successfully appeals a covered authorization.

															2

															Transform’s second major salvo fares no
better. It points to former Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure
805, which was promulgated in 1976,[9] and characterizes that Rule as
“ ‘declaratory of ’ ” a
historic practice in which some appellate courts dismissed appeals
“challenging the validity of a consummated sale
. . . without considering the merits,” which
Transform equates with jurisdictional treatment. Brief for
Respondent 43–44. Transform vigorously maintains that
Congress fully transplanted Rule 805 into §363(m), and that
§363(m) therefore imbibed the jurisdictional character that
Rule 805 incorporated from the historic practice.

															This argument relies on a supposed pre-1976
lower court jurisdictional consensus that Rule 805 formalized and
Congress then built into §363(m). But Transform trips over the
first hurdle: Rule 805’s supposedly jurisdictional character.
We rejected this sort of use of old lower court cases in
Boechler, because “almost all” of those lower
court cases “predate[d] this Court’s effort to
‘bring some discipline’ to the use of the term
‘jurisdictional.’ ” 596 U. S., at
___–___ (slip op., at 7–8). The facts here are even
worse for Transform: Every case it cites to prove that Rule
805 was jurisdictional predates §363(m)’s initial 1978
enactment, and thus long predates our modern efforts on
jurisdictional nomenclature. If numerous recent lower court
opinions (some as recent as 2005) treating the provision at issue
as jurisdictional were not enough in Reed Elsevier, 559
U. S., at 160, n. 2, 169, Transform’s weaker
proffer will not do.

															*  *  *

															Nothing in Transform’s creative arguments
in this case persuades us that §363(m) is jurisdictional under
our clear-statement precedents. Because the Second Circuit’s
judgment rested on the mistaken belief that §363(m) is
jurisdictional, we vacate that judgment and remand the case for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.[10]

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 This corporate
distinction is immaterial for present purposes, so we refer
collectively to Transform and its subsidiary as
“Transform.”
2
 Whether this fear was
justified under a proper interpretation of §363(m) is a
question we need not, and so do not, decide today.
3
 Compare, e.g.,
In re Stanford, 17 F. 4th 116, 122 (CA11 2021)
(§363(m) is not jurisdictional), and In re Energy
Future Holdings Corp., 949 F.3d 806, 820 (CA3 2020) (same),
with In re WestPoint Stevens, Inc., 600 F.3d 231, 248
(CA2 2010) (§363(m) is jurisdictional).

 MOAC, naturally, disputes
Transform’s contentions. And MOAC’s arguments about
legally available forms of relief are not “so implausible
that [they are] insufficient to preserve jurisdiction.”
Chafin, 568 U. S., at 174 (citing Steel Co. v.
Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S.
83, 89 (1998)). We need not take a definitive position on the
correct resolution of Transform’s elaborate mootness argument
to be confident that MOAC’s disagreement is not frivolous.
Id., at 89 (explaining that an argument is implausible, in
the relevant sense, when it is “ ‘wholly
insubstantial and frivolous . . . so insubstantial,
implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or
otherwise completely devoid of
merit’ ”).
5
 Section 1334 grants
bankruptcy jurisdiction to the district courts in the first
instance, and those courts may “refe[r]” such
jurisdiction to bankruptcy courts under prescribed circumstances.
Wellness Int’l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575
U.S. 665, 670–671 (2015).
6
 To be clear, we do not
hold here that 11 U. S. C. §305(c) is
jurisdictional. The point is only that, as jurisdictional
cross-references go, §363(m) is not the Code’s clearest
case.

 See, e.g.,
Musacchio v. United States, 577 U.S. 237, 246 (2016)
(a federal criminal statute commanding that “ ‘no
person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any
offense’ ” unless the charging document is filed
