															EFRAIN LORA, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[June 16, 2023]

															

															Justice Jackson delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															When a federal court imposes multiple prison
sentences, it can typically choose whether to run the sentences
concurrently or consecutively. See 18 U. S. C.
§3584. An exception exists in subsection (c) of §924,
which provides that “no term of imprisonment imposed on a
person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other
term of imprisonment.” §924(c)(1)(D)(ii).

															In this case, we consider whether
§924(c)’s bar on concurrent sentences extends to a
sentence imposed under a different subsection: §924(j). We
hold that it does not. A sentence for a §924(j) conviction
therefore can run either concurrently with or consecutively to
another sentence.

															In 2002, members of a drug-dealing group from
the Bronx assassinated a rival drug dealer. The Government accused
petitioner Efrain Lora of being one of the group’s leaders
and acting as a scout during the fatal shooting. After a jury
trial, Lora was convicted of aiding and abetting a violation of
§924(j)(1), which penalizes “[a] person who, in the
course of a violation of subsection (c), causes the death of a
person through the use of a firearm,” where “the
killing is a murder.” See also §2(a) (an aider and
abettor is punishable “as a principal”). Lora was also
convicted of conspiring to distribute drugs, in violation of 21
U. S. C. §§841 and 846.

															At sentencing, the District Court rejected two
of Lora’s arguments about his §924(j) conviction. Most
pertinent here, Lora argued that the District Court had discretion
to run the §924(j) sentence concurrently with the drug-
distribution-conspiracy sentence. The District Court held it lacked
such discretion. Applying Circuit precedent, it held that
§924(c)(1)(D)(ii)’s bar on concurrent sentences governs
§924(j) sentences, such that Lora’s two sentences had to
run consecutively. See United States v. Barrett, 937
F.3d 126, 129, n. 2 (CA2 2019). Lora also argued that a
§924(j) conviction is not subject to the mandatory minimum
sentences specified in §924(c). Disagreeing once again, the
District Court applied the five-year mandatory minimum under
§924(c)(1)(A) to Lora’s sentencing calculation.

															The District Court ultimately sentenced Lora to
30 years of imprisonment: 25 years on the drug-distribution-
conspiracy count and—consecutively—five years on the
§924(j) count. Lora also received five years of supervised
release.

															The Court of Appeals affirmed, adhering to its
precedent barring §924(j) sentences from running concurrently
with other sentences. That decision reinforced a conflict among the
Courts of Appeals over whether §924(c)(1)(D)(ii)’s
concurrent-sentence bar governs §924(j) sentences.[1] We granted certiorari to resolve the
conflict. 598 U. S. ___ (2022).

															II

															A

															This case concerns federal laws that
criminalize the use, carrying, and possession of firearms in
connection with certain crimes. The relevant parts of that scheme
are spread across two subsections of 18 U. S. C.
§924.

															Subsection (c) lays out a set of offenses and
their corresponding penalties. It begins by making it a crime
either to “us[e] or carr[y] a firearm” “during
and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking
crime,” or to “posses[s] a firearm” “in
furtherance of any such crime.” §924(c)(1)(A). The
provision then prescribes “a term of imprisonment” for
that offense: a minimum of five years. §924(c)(1)(A)(i).

															Other (more serious) offense elements and
“term[s] of imprisonment” follow within subsection (c).
If the firearm is “brandished,” the “term of
imprisonment” jumps to a minimum of seven years.
§924(c)(1)(A)(ii). If the firearm is “discharged,”
the minimum becomes 10 years; if the firearm is a
“machinegun,” 30 years; and so on.
§§924(c)(1)(A)–(C), (c)(5).

															Subsection (c) also provides that “no term
of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run
concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the
person.” §924(c)(1)(D)(ii). In other words, the sentence
must run consecutively, not concurrently, in relation to other
sentences. This concurrent-sentence bar (or consecutive-sentence
mandate) is at issue in this case.

															Subsection (j) was added decades after
subsection (c) and its consecutive-sentence mandate.[2] Subsection (j) likewise lays out offense
elements and corresponding penalties. It provides:

															“A person who, in the course of a
violation of subsection (c), causes the death of a person through
the use of a firearm, shall—

															“(1) if the killing is a murder (as
defined in section 1111), be punished by death or by imprisonment
for any term of years or for life; and

															“(2) if the killing is manslaughter (as
defined in section 1112), be punished as provided in that
section.” §924(j).

															Subsection (j) contains no consecutive-sentence
mandate.

															B

															Here, Lora was convicted of a subsection (j)
offense. The parties dispute whether the sentence for that offense
can run concurrently with another sentence, or whether it is
subject to subsection (c)’s consecutive-sentence mandate. We
hold the former.

															Subsection (c)’s consecutive-sentence
requirement applies to a “term of imprisonment imposed on a
person under this subsection”—i.e.,
subsection (c). §924(c)(1)(D)(ii) (emphasis added). By those
plain terms, Congress applied the consecutive-sentence mandate only
to terms of imprisonment imposed under that subsection. And
Congress put subsection (j) in a different subsection of the
statute.

															Drilling into the details confirms that
straightforward reasoning. To begin, subsection (c) sets forth a
host of offenses and the corresponding “term[s] of
imprisonment” to be imposed. §§924(c)(1), (5);
supra, at 3. Those are the “term[s] of imprisonment
imposed . . . under this subsection” that the
consecutive-sentence mandate references. §924(c)(1)(D)(ii).
That is, by echoing the phrase “term of imprisonment”
and referring inwards to “this subsection,”
§924(c)(1)(D)(ii) points to the terms of imprisonment
prescribed within subsection (c).

															A sentence imposed under subsection (j) does not
qualify. To state the obvious again, subsection (j) is not located
within subsection (c). Nor does subsection (j) call for imposing
any sentence from subsection (c). Instead, subsection (j) provides
its own set of penalties. See §§924(j)(1)–(2).

															To be sure, subsection (j) references
subsection (c). But it does so only with respect to offense
elements, not penalties. Subsection (j)’s offense elements
include causing death “in the course of a violation of
subsection (c).” §924(j). And to define that phrase, one
must consult subsection (c)’s offense elements (i.e.,
what it takes to violate that subsection). But that is where
subsection (c)’s role in subsection (j) stops. One need not
consult subsection (c)’s sentences in order to sentence a
subsection (j) defendant.

															Thus, a defendant who is sentenced under
subsection (j) does not receive a “term of imprisonment
imposed . . . under [subsection (c)].”
Consequently, §924(c)(1)(D)(ii)’s consecutive-sentence
mandate does not apply.

															III

															A

															The Government tries to deflect this
conclusion by blending subsections (c) and (j) together. It claims
that “Congress incorporated Section 924(c) as a whole
into Section 924(j).” Brief for United States 15. Under that
view, a subsection (j) defendant faces subsection (j)’s
penalties plus subsection (c)’s
penalties—including subsection (c)’s mandatory minimum
sentences and its consecutive-sentence mandate.

															The actual statute bears no resemblance to the
Government’s vision. Subsection (j) nowhere
mentions—let alone incorporates—subsection (c)’s
penalties. Instead, as just explained, subsection (j)’s only
reference to subsection (c) is limited to offense elements.
Supra this page.

															Moreover, a sentencing court cannot follow both
subsection (c) and subsection (j) as written. Combining the two
subsections would set them on a collision course; indeed, in some
cases, the maximum sentence would be lower than the minimum
sentence. Take voluntary manslaughter using a machinegun in the
course of a subsection (c)(1) violation, for example. Subsection
(c), because of the machinegun, would command that “the
person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less
than 30 years.” §924(c)(1)(B)(ii). Subsection (j),
because of the voluntary manslaughter, would command that, per
§1112, the person “shall be . . . imprisoned
not more than 15 years.” §§924(j)(2), 1112(b). To
fashion a sentence “not less than 30 years” and
“not more than 15 years”—that is, to obey both
subsections (c) and (j)—is impossible. And Congress has not
required that unachievable result. Instead, subsection (j) supplies
its own comprehensive set of penalties that apply instead of
subsection (c)’s.

															To avert potential conflict between subsections
(c) and (j), the Government tries to knit the two provisions
together in a very particular way. In the Government’s view,
a court sentencing a subsection (j) defendant should jump to
subsection (c), apply the penalties listed there, then jump back to
subsection (j) and add the penalties listed there, then jump back
to subsection (c) and impose the consecutive- sentence mandate
listed in that subsection. But nothing in subsection (j) calls for
such calisthenics.

															To assuage that concern, the Government
maintains that Congress has done this elsewhere; it says that
another provision, §924(c)(5), operates this way. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 27, 31. Even if §924(c)(5) does work in that
fashion—which we do not decide—the Government’s
argument only underscores that subsection (j) does not.

															Under §924(c)(5), a person who, inter
alia, uses armor piercing ammunition during and in relation to
a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime:

															“shall . . .

															“(A) be sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of not less than 15 years; and

															“(B) if death results from the use of
such ammunition—

															“(i) if the killing is murder (as defined
in section 1111), be punished by death or sentenced to a term of
imprisonment for any term of years or for life; and

															“(ii) if the killing is manslaughter (as
defined in section 1112), be punished as provided in section
1112.” (Emphasis added.)

															According to the Government, §924(c)(5)
adds two penalties together when death results: Someone convicted
of murder resulting from the use of such ammunition faces a 15-year
mandatory minimum sentence under §924(c)(5)(A) plus an
additional sentence for murder under §924(c)(5)(B)(i). Tr. of
Oral Arg. 27, 31.

															But subsection (j) is cast from a different
mold. Section 924(c)(5) groups the two penalties together and joins
them with the word “and.” In contrast, several
unrelated subsections separate subsections (c) and (j)
structurally, and nothing joins their penalties textually. So even
if those features of §924(c)(5) make it operate as the
Government contends, those aspects of §924(c)(5) are missing
from subsection (j).

															In the Government’s own telling, then,
§924(c)(5) shows how Congress could have constructed penalties
that might ultimately add together. Yet Congress did not implement
that design in subsection (j).

															Equally unavailing is the Government’s
invocation of double jeopardy principles. According to the
Government’s brief, “Section 924(j) amounts to the
‘same offense’ as Section 924(c) for purposes of the
Double Jeopardy Clause,” so “a defendant may be
punished for either a Section 924(c) offense or a
Section 924(j) offense, but not both.” Brief for
United States 22–26 (emphasis added; alterations and some
internal quotation marks omitted). The Government argues that this
conception of double jeopardy confirms subsection (j) incorporates
all of subsection (c). Ibid.

															We express no position on the Government’s
view of double jeopardy, because even assuming it, arguendo,
the Government’s view does not refute our holding on the
question presented. The Government says someone cannot receive both
subsection (c) and subsection (j) sentences for the same conduct.
But that aligns with our conclusion here: If a defendant receives a
sentence under subsection (j), he does not receive a
sentence “imposed . . . under [subsection
(c)]” that would trigger the consecutive-sentence mandate.
§924(c)(1)(D)(ii). Accordingly, the Government’s view of
double jeopardy can easily be squared with our view that subsection
(j) neither incorporates subsection (c)’s penalties nor
triggers the consecutive-sentence mandate.

															B

															The Government protests that it is
“implausible” that Congress imposed the harsh
consecutive-sentence mandate under subsection (c) but not
subsection (j), which covers more serious offense conduct. Brief
for United States 9, 28–35. Yet that result is consistent
with other design features of the statute.

															Congress plainly chose a different approach to
punishment in subsection (j) than in subsection (c). Subsection
(c), first enacted in 1968, is full of mandatory penalties.
It contains mandatory minimum years of imprisonment and mandatory
consecutive sentences. In fact, when subsection (j) was enacted in
1994, subsection (c) specified not just mandatory minimums, but
exact mandatory terms of imprisonment. 18 U. S. C.
§924(c)(1) (1994 ed.) (e.g., exactly five years of
imprisonment for the base subsection (c) offense).

															Subsection (j), by contrast, generally eschews
mandatory penalties in favor of sentencing flexibility. Unlike
subsection (c), subsection (j) contains no mandatory minimums. Even
for murder, subsection (j) expressly permits a sentence of
“any term of years.” §924(j)(1) (emphasis
added). This follows the same pattern as several other provisions
enacted alongside subsection (j) in the Federal Death Penalty Act
of 1994, 108 Stat. 1959. In those provisions, as in
§924(j)(1), Congress authorized the death penalty, but also a
flexible range of lesser sentences for “any term of
years,” with no mandatory minimum or consecutive-sentence
mandate.[3] In the same law,
Congress also enacted a provision allowing judges to go below the
otherwise-mandatory minimum sentence in certain cases.[4] Given those choices to favor
sentencing flexibility over mandatory penalties, it is not
“implausible,” as the Government asserts, that
subsection (j) permits flexibility to choose between concurrent and
consecutive sentences.

															Nor is that flexibility incompatible with the
seriousness of subsection (j) offenses. Subsection (j) merely
reflects the seriousness of the offense using a different approach
than subsection (c)’s mandatory penalties. For murder,
subsection (j) authorizes the harshest maximum penalty possible:
death. §924(j)(1). And for manslaughter, subsection (j)
imposes the same harsh punishment that the Federal Criminal Code
prescribes for other manslaughters. See §924(j)(2) (aligning
penalties with §1112).[5]

															Congress could certainly have designed the
penalty scheme at issue here differently. It could have mandated
harsher punishment under subsection (j) than under subsection (c).
It could have added a consecutive-sentence mandate to subsection
(j). It could have written subsection (c)’s
consecutive-sentence mandate more broadly. It could have placed
subsection (j) within subsection (c).[6]

															But Congress did not do any of these things. And
we must implement the design Congress chose.

															*  *  *

															Because the consecutive-sentence mandate in
§924(c)(1)(D)(ii) does not govern §924(j) sentences, the
District Court had discretion to impose Lora’s §924(j)
sentence concurrently with another sentence. We vacate the judgment
of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

															

															It is so ordered.

 When Congress enacted
subsection (j), it actually imposed higher maximum penalties for
manslaughter under subsection (j) than what subsection (c) had
authorized for the base offense. A base subsection (c) violation
triggered a fixed five-year sentence, while subsection (j)(2)
authorized more: up to 10 years for voluntary manslaughter and six
years for involuntary manslaughter. 18 U. S. C.
§§924(c)(1), (i)(2), 1112 (1994 ed.); see 110 Stat. 3505
(redesignating subsection (i) as subsection (j)). This reinforces
that Congress designed subsection (j)’s penalties to account
for the seriousness of the offense by themselves, without
incorporating penalties from subsection (c).
6
 Congress specifically
considered and rejected that last possibility. The 1994 Congress
had before it a proposal to add, within subsection (c), a provision
authorizing the death penalty when a subsection (c) violation
results in homicide. See 140 Cong. Rec. 11165, 24066. Congress
rejected that option and enacted a different version of that crime
bill—which created subsection (j).
