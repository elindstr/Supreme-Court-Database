															REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA, PETITIONER v. NML
CAPITAL, LTD.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[June 16, 2014]

															

															     Justice Ginsburg,
dissenting.

															     The Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U. S. C. §§1330,
1602 et seq., if one of several conditions is met, permits
execution of a judgment rendered in the United States against a
foreign sovereign only on “property in the United States
. . . used for a commercial activity.”
§1610(a). Accordingly, no inquiry into a foreign
sovereign’s property in the United States that is not
“used for a commercial activity” could be ordered; such
an inquiry,as the Court recognizes, would not be
“ ‘relevant’ to execution in the first
place.” Ante, at 10 (citing Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 26(b)(1)). Yet the Court permits unlimited inquiry into
Argentina’s property outside the United States, whether or
not the property is “used for a commercial activity.”
By what authorization does a court in the United States become a
“clearinghouse for information,” ante,at 3 (internal
quotation marks omitted), about any and all property held by
Argentina abroad? NML may seek such information, the Court reasons,
because “NML does not yet know what property Argentina has
[outside the United States], let alone whether it is executable
under the relevant jurisdiction’s law.” Ante, at 10.
But see Société Nationale Industrielle
Aérospatiale v. United States Dist. Court for Southern Dist.
of Iowa, 482 U. S. 522, 542 (1987) (observing that other
jurisdictions generally allow much more limited discovery than is
available in the United States).

															     A court in the United
States has no warrant to indulge the assumption that, outside our
country, the sky may be the limit for attaching a foreign
sovereign’s property in order to execute a U. S. judgment
against the foreign sovereign. Cf. §1602 (“Under
international law, . . . th[e] commercial property [of a
state] may be levied upon for the satisfaction of judgments
rendered against [the state] in connection with [its] commercial
activities.” (emphasis added)). Without proof of any kind
that other nations broadly expose a foreign sovereign’s
property to arrest, attachment or execution, a more modest
assumption is in order. See EM Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 695
F. 3d 201, 207 (CA2 2012) (recognizing that postjudgment
discovery “must be calculated to assist in collecting on a
judgment” (citing Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 26(b)(1),
69(a)(2))).

															     Unless and until the
judgment debtor, here, NML, proves that other nations would allow
unconstrained access to Argentina’s assets, I would be guided
by the one law we know for sure—our own. That guide is all
the more appropriate, as our law coincides with the international
norm. See §1602. Accordingly, I would limit NML’s
discovery to property used here or abroad “in connection with
. . . commercial activities.” §§1602,
1610(a). I therefore dissent from the sweeping examination of
Argentina’s worldwide assets the Court exorbitantly approves
today.
