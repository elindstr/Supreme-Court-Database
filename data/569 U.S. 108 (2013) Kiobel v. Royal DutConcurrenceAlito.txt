															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															ESTHER KIOBEL, individually and on behalf of
her late husband, Dr. BARINEM KIOBEL, et al., PETI- TIONERS
v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO. et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[April 17, 2013]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring.

															I concur in the judgment and join the opinion of
the Court as far as it goes. Specifically, I agree that when Alien
Tort Statute (ATS) “claims touch and concern the territory of
the United States, they must do so with sufficient force to
displace the presumption against extraterritorial
application.” Ante, at 14. This formulation obviously
leaves much unanswered, and perhaps there is wisdom in the
Court’s preference for this narrow approach. I write
separately to set out the broader standard that leads me to the
conclusion that this case falls within the scope of the
presumption.

															In Morrison v. National Australia Bank
Ltd., 561 U. S. ___ (2010), we explained that “the
presumption against extraterritorial application would be a craven
watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel whenever some
domestic activity is involved in the case.” Id., at
___ (slip op., at 17). We also reiterated that a cause of action
falls out- side the scope of the presumption—and thus is not
barred by the presumption—only if the event or relationship
that was “the ‘focus’ of congressional
concern” under the relevant statute takes place within the
United States. Ibid. (quoting EEOC v. Arabian
American Oil Co., 499 U.S.
244, 255 (1991)). For example, because “the focus of the
[Securities] Exchange Act [of 1934] is not upon the place where the
deception originated, but upon purchases and sales of securities in
the United States,” we held in Mor-rison that
§10(b) of the Exchange Act applies “only” to
“transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges, and
domestic transactions in other securities.” 561 U. S.,
at ___–___ (slip op., at 17–18).

															The Court’s decision in Sosa v.
Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S.
692 (2004), makes clear that when the ATS was enacted,
“congressional concern” was
“ ‘focus[ed],’ ” Morrison,
supra, at ___ (slip op., at 17), on the “three
principal offenses against the law of nations” that had been
identified by Blackstone: violation of safe conducts, infringement
of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy, Sosa, 542
U. S., at 723–724. The Court therefore held that
“federal courts should not recognize private claims under
federal common law for violations of any international law norm
with less definite content and acceptance among civilized nations
than the historical paradigms familiar when [the ATS] was
enacted.” Id., at 732. In other words, only conduct
that satisfies Sosa’s requirements of definiteness and
ac-ceptance among civilized nations can be said to have been
“the ‘focus’ of congressional concern,”
Morrison, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 17), when
Congress enacted the ATS. As a result, a putative ATS cause of
action will fall within the scope of the presumption against
extraterritoriality—and will therefore be barred—unless
the domestic conduct is sufficient to violate an international law
norm that satisfies Sosa’s requirements of
definiteness and acceptance among civilized nations.
