U.S. Supreme Court
Woodward v. Brown, 38 U.S. 13 Pet. 1 1
(1839)
Woodward v. Brown
38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 1
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
UNITED STATES FOR
THE COUNTY OF WASHINGTON IN THE
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
Syllabus

															Where, by a misprision of the clerk of the circuit court, the
judgment in a case brought up by a writ of error had not been
entered according to the declaration, the Supreme Court allowed an
amendment to be made by the entry of the judgment without awarding
a certiorari to the circuit court. This was done in a case which
had been brought up by a writ of error to the previous term of the
Court.

															It is a well established principle of law, that a tenant cannot
dispute the title of his landlord, and where the Marshal of the
District of Columbia, having a writ of habere facias
possessionem for the west half of a lot in the City of
Washington, took possession of the east half of the lot, and the
tenant of the persons who claimed to be the owners of the lot
attorned to the plaintiffs in the writ, such attornment was without
authority and was void.

															A tenant who disclaims his landlord's title is not entitled to
notice to quit and deliver up possession.

															In an action of ejectment, the day of the ouster need not be
alleged, and it is sufficient if it is laid after the demise.

															The specific date under a videlicet is not necessary in
a declaration in ejectment, and may be rejected as surplusage if it
sufficiently appears on the face of the declaration that the ouster
was after the entry under the several demises.

															The rule is well established that when the right of entry is by
ouster of the title of the wife, the demise may be laid in the name
of the husband or in the names of the husband and wife.

															Mr. Brent, for the defendants in error, moved for a writ of
certiorari to the Clerk of the Circuit Court of the County of
Washington on the allegation of a diminution of the record of the
cause in that court. The clerk had, by a misprision, made an error
in not entering the judgment according to the declaration.

															Coxe, for the plaintiff in error, objected to the allowance of
the motion. The case came up to the last term of this Court, and it
is now too late to issue the certiorari asked for. The error cannot
be

															Page 38 U. S. 2

															amended without an application to the circuit court for
authority to make the amendment. The clerk cannot, therefore, send
up an amended record.

															Mr. Brent -- In a writ of error in the King's Bench in England,
amendments of the record can be made after the writ issued. He
cited 5 Burrow 2730. 2 Strange 908.

															The court allowed the amendment to be made in this Court. The
case as stated in the opinion of the court was as follows.

															"An action of ejectment was commenced by the defendants in error
against the plaintiffs, to recover possession of the eastern half
of lot numbered 2, in square numbered 348 in the City of
Washington. Several distinct demises were laid in the declaration
of different dates and for different periods of time."

															"One of the demises was in the name of Jane Stinger, while she
was single, but now Sarah Jane Brown, wife of the said James Brown,
and another in the names of James Brown and Sarah Jane Brown, his
wife."

															"The general issue was pleaded, and the jury found a general
verdict of guilty."

															"On the trial the plaintiffs proved that up to 22 Nov., 1834,
the defendant was the tenant of Sarah Jane Stinger, who
intermarried with the plaintiff Brown in the fall of the year 1835.
That after November, 1834, he refused to pay rent, and claimed to
hold possession of the premises as tenant of the Bank of the United
States. That at the time the premises were rented to the defendant,
the said Sarah Jane was seized and possessed of the same in fee
simple. And that about the time of his refusal to pay rent, notice
was given to the defendant to quit, and also afterwards in January,
1835."

															"Upon this evidence the plaintiffs rested their case, and the
defendant's counsel moved the court to instruct the jury that they
were not entitled to recover on the evidence, which instruction the
court refused to give, and the defendant excepted to this opinion
of the court."

															"And the defendant proved that the deputy marshal, having a writ
of habere facias possessionem against the defendant for
the west half of said lot, but supposing the writ to be for the
east half, of which the defendant was in possession, he was
required by the deputy marshal to surrender the possession of the
east half of the lot to the agent of the Bank of the United States,
and he did surrender the possession to him, and the defendant
agreed to hold possession under the bank. But the court overruled
this evidence, to which opinion of the court the defendant also
excepted."

															The writ of error was prosecuted by the defendant in the circuit
court.

															MR. JUSTICE McLEAN delivered the opinion of the Court.

															After stating the case:

															The counsel for the plaintiffs contend that the ruling of the
court was erroneous and that the declaration is essentially
defective.

															It appears from the bill of exceptions that the plaintiffs not
only proved title, but also that the defendant entered into the
possession of the premises under their title as tenant. These facts
being proved, the court very properly refused to instruct the jury,
as stated in the first bill of exceptions, that the plaintiffs were
not entitled to recover.

															And there is no doubt that the court properly excluded the
evidence stated in the second bill of exceptions.

															The writ of possession, which is admitted to have been issued in
pursuance of the judgment, did not call for the east half of the
lot, of which the defendant was in possession, and the marshal had
no right to change his possession of this lot. And the attornment
to the agent of the bank was voluntary, and without authority. The
well established principle, therefore, that a tenant shall not be
permitted to dispute his landlord's title excludes the defendant
from setting up the title of the bank.

															The objection as to the sufficiency of the notice of the
defendant cannot be sustained. He had disclaimed his landlord's
title and attorned to the bank. Under such circumstances, he was
not entitled to notice. 28 U. S. 3 Pet.
48; 1 Wheaton's Selwyn 585. But if notice to quit had been
necessary, it was given, and, as appears from the bill of
exceptions, all objection to its "sufficiency and legality" was
waived by the defendant.

															The declaration, it is insisted, is defective in several
particulars.

															Page 38 U. S. 5

															That the demises are inconsistent, and that the ouster is
alleged two years before the last demise.

															On the part of the plaintiff it is intimated that as the case is
brought up on bills of exceptions, the defects in the declaration
are not before the Court for consideration. The assignment of
errors is not limited to the bills of exceptions, but may embrace
any errors which appear on the face of the record.

															The last demise is stated to have been made in eighteen hundred
and thirty-six, and the ouster alleged,

															"by virtue of which said several demises, the said Richard
entered into and singular the premises aforesaid, with the
appurtenances thereunto belonging, and was thereof possessed, and
the said Richard being so thereof possessed, the said John Doe
afterwards, to-wit, on the twenty-fourth day of November, in the
year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four, with
force and arms,"

															&c.

															The day of the ouster need not be alleged, and it is sufficient
if laid after the demise. 2 Chitt. 881. 1 Wheaton's Selwyn 590.

															In this declaration it is averred that the plaintiff entered
under the said several demises, and being in possession, the said
John Doe afterwards, to-wit; on, &c. The specific date under a
videlicet was unnecessary, and may be rejected as
surplusage, it sufficiently appearing on the face of the
declaration that the ouster was after the entry under the several
demises.

															There is no repugnancy in the several demises laid; one, in the
name of Jane Stinger, was before the marriage, and the last demise
being subsequent to the marriage, it is well laid in the names of
the husband and wife. The rule is well established that where the
right of entry is by virtue of the title of the wife, the demise
may be laid in the name of the husband or in the names of both
husband and wife. 2 Chitt. 878.

															It is not perceived how the demises as laid in this declaration
can prejudice the rights of the defendant in an action for the
mesne profits. They will enable the lessor of the plaintiff to
recover the profits from the time the defendant refused to pay the
rent, and this he is entitled to. Upon the whole, we think there is
no error in the proceedings of the circuit court, and the judgment
is therefore

															Affirmed with costs.
