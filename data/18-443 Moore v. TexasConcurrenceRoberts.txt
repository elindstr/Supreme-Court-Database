															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															BOBBY JAMES MOORE v. TEXAS

															on petition for writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of texas

															No. 18–443. Decided February 19, 2019

															

															Chief Justice Roberts, concurring.

															When this case was before us two years ago, I wrote in dissent that the majority’s articulation of how courts should enforce the requirements of Atkins v. Virginia,

536 U.S. 304 (2002), lacked clarity.  Moore v. Texas, 581 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2017) (slip op., at 10–11).  It still does.  But putting aside the difficulties of applying Moore in other cases, it is easy to see that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals misapplied it here.  On remand, the court re- peated the same errors that this Court previously condemned—if not quite in haec verba, certainly in substance.  The court repeated its improper reliance on the factors articulated in Ex parte Briseno, 135 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), and again emphasized Moore’s adaptive strengths rather than his deficits.  That did not pass muster under this Court’s analysis last time.  It still doesn’t.  For those reasons, I join the Court’s opinion reversing the judgment below.
