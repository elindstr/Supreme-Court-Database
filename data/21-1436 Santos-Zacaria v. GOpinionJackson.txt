															LEON SANTOS-ZACARIA aka LEON SANTOS-SACARIAS,
PETITIONER v. MERRICK B. GARLAND, ATTORNEY GENERAL

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[May 11, 2023]

															

															Justice Jackson delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															Under 8 U. S. C. §1252(d)(1), a
noncitizen who seeks to challenge an order of removal in court must
first exhaust certain administrative remedies. This case presents
two questions regarding that statutory provision. For the reasons
explained below, we hold that §1252(d)(1) is not
jurisdictional. We hold further that a noncitizen need not request
discretionary forms of administrative review, like reconsideration
of an unfavorable Board of Immigration Appeals determination, in
order to satisfy §1252(d)(1)’s exhaustion
requirement.[1]

															I

															Petitioner Leon Santos-Zacaria (who goes by
the name Estrella) fled her native Guatemala in her early teens.
She has testified that she left that country, and fears returning,
because she suffered physical harm and faced death threats as a
transgender woman who is attracted to men.

															Santos-Zacaria eventually sought refuge in the
United States. Her first stay in the country was brief, and she was
removed by immigration authorities in 2008. In 2018, she returned
and was apprehended again by immigration authorities.

															At that point, Santos-Zacaria sought protection
from removal, including withholding of removal based on the
likelihood she would be persecuted in Guatemala. See 8
U. S. C. §1231(b)(3)(A). An Immigration Judge within
the Department of Justice entered an order reinstating
Santos-Zacaria’s prior removal order and denying the
protection she sought.

															On appeal within the Department, the Board of
Immigration Appeals upheld the Immigration Judge’s denial of
withholding of removal. The Board agreed with Santos-Zacaria in
part, determining that she had suffered past persecution in
Guatemala and was therefore entitled to a presumption of future
persecution. But the Board found that this presumption was rebutted
(which was an issue that the Immigration Judge had not
reached).

															Santos-Zacaria then filed a petition for review
in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit under 8
U. S. C. §1252. Her petition contended, among other
things, that when the Board concluded that the presumption of
future persecution was rebutted, it had impermissibly engaged in
factfinding that only the Immigration Judge could perform.

															In a 2-to-1 decision, the Court of Appeals
dismissed Santos-Zacaria’s impermissible-factfinding
challenge for lack of jurisdiction, on the ground that she had
failed to exhaust administrative remedies under §1252(d)(1).
22 F. 4th 570, 573 (2022). The Government had not raised
exhaustion, but the Court of Appeals did so sua sponte
because it characterized §1252(d)(1) as establishing a
jurisdictional requirement. The court further held that, because
Santos-Zacaria had not raised the impermissible-factfinding
challenge in a motion for reconsideration before the Board prior to
filing her petition with the court, she had not satisfied
§1252(d)(1)’s exhaustion requirement.

															There is disagreement among the Courts of
Appeals concerning the two issues presented in this case: (1)
whether §1252(d)(1)’s exhaustion requirement is
jurisdictional,[2] and (2)
whether §1252(d)(1) requires seeking discretionary
administrative review, like reconsideration by the Board of
Immigration Appeals.[3] We
granted certiorari to resolve these conflicts. 598 U. S. ___
(2022).

															II

															Section 1252(d)(1) provides: “A court
may review a final order of removal only if . . . the
alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the
alien as of right.” The first question before us is whether
this provision ranks as jurisdictional. We hold that it does
not.

															A

															A “jurisdictional” prescription
sets the bounds of the “court’s adjudicatory
authority.” Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S.
443, 455 (2004). By contrast, nonjurisdictional rules govern
how courts and litigants operate within those bounds.
Claim-processing rules, for example, “seek to promote the
orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take
certain procedural steps at certain specified times.”
Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S.
428, 435 (2011).

															“Harsh consequences attend the
jurisdictional brand.” Fort Bend County v.
Davis, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 7)
(alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). For example,
because courts are not able to exceed limits on their adjudicative
authority, they cannot grant equitable exceptions to jurisdictional
rules. See Boechler v. Commissioner, 596 U. S.
___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 3). Jurisdictional objections also
can be raised at any time in the litigation. Hamer v.
Neighborhood Housing Servs. of Chicago, 583 U.S. 17,
___–___ (2017) (slip op., at 2–3). Moreover, and most
relevant here, courts must enforce jurisdictional rules sua
sponte, even in the face of a litigant’s forfeiture or
waiver. Ibid.

															We treat a rule as jurisdictional “only if
Congress ‘clearly states’ that it is.”
Boechler, 596 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (quoting
Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546
U.S. 500, 515 (2006)). And “[w]here multiple plausible
interpretations exist—only one of which is
jurisdictional—it is difficult to make the case that the
jurisdictional reading is clear.” 596 U. S., at ___
(slip op., at 5). We adopted this clear-statement principle in
Arbaugh “to leave the ball in Congress’
court,” ensuring that courts impose harsh jurisdictional
consequences only when Congress unmistakably has so instructed. 546
U. S., at 515–516; see Wilkins v. United
States, 598 U.S. 152, 157–158 (2023).

															B

															Two aspects of §1252(d)(1), taken
together, persuade us that this statutory provision lacks the clear
statement necessary to qualify as jurisdictional.

															First, §1252(d)(1) imposes an exhaustion
requirement, which is a quintessential claim-processing rule. When
faced with a type of statutory requirement that “ordinarily
[is] not jurisdictional,” we naturally expect the ordinary
case, not an “exceptional one.” Sebelius v.
Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568
U.S. 145, 154–155 (2013); see also, e.g.,
United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 575 U.S. 402, 410
(2015). So it is here. We routinely “trea[t] as
nonjurisdictional . . . threshold requirements that
claimants must complete, or exhaust, before filing a
lawsuit.” Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick,
559 U.S.
154, 166, and n. 6 (2010).[4] Indeed, we have yet to hold that any statutory
exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional when applying the
clear-statement rule that we adopted in Arbaugh.

															Exhaustion is typically nonjurisdictional for
good reason. Jurisdictional treatment of an exhaustion requirement
could undo the benefits of exhaustion. That is, exhaustion promotes
efficiency, including by encouraging parties to resolve their
disputes without litigation. See Jones v. Bock,
549
U.S. 199, 219 (2007); McCarthy v. Madigan,
503 U.S.
140, 145 (1992). But jurisdictional treatment can result in the
opposite: If exhaustion is jurisdictional, litigants must slog
through preliminary nonjudicial proceedings even when, for example,
no party demands it or a court finds it would be pointless,
wasteful, or too slow. Similarly, an exhaustion objection raised
late in litigation (as jurisdictional objections can be) might
derail “many months of work on the part of the attorneys and
the court.” Henderson, 562 U. S., at
434–435 (jurisdictional rules risk “the waste of
judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants”).
Thus, jurisdictional treatment could disserve the very interest in
efficiency that exhaustion ordinarily advances. See Wilkins,
598 U. S., at 158 (“Given th[e] risk of disruption and
waste that accompanies the jurisdictional label, courts will not
lightly apply it to procedures Congress enacted to keep things
running smoothly and efficiently”).

															It would therefore be aberrant for the
exhaustion requirement in §1252(d)(1) to be characterized as
jurisdictional. Of course, “Congress is free to attach”
jurisdictional consequences to a requirement that usually exists as
a claim- processing rule. Henderson, 562 U. S., at 435.
But to be confident Congress took that unexpected tack, we would
need unmistakable evidence, on par with express language addressing
the court’s jurisdiction. Nothing close appears here.

															Instead, a second feature of the statute
compounds our doubt that §1252(d)(1) qualifies as a
jurisdictional rule: That provision’s language differs
substantially from more clearly jurisdictional language in related
statutory provisions. Elsewhere in the laws governing immigration
cases, Congress specified that “no court shall have
jurisdiction” to review certain matters.[5] Over and over again, Congress used that
language in provisions that were enacted at the same time—and
even in the same section—as §1252(d)(1).[6] But Congress eschewed such plainly
jurisdictional language in §1252(d)(1).

															The contrast between the text of
§1252(d)(1) and the “unambiguous jurisdictional
terms” in related provisions “show[s] that Congress
would have spoken in clearer terms if it intended” for
§1252(d)(1) “to have similar jurisdictional
force.” Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S.
134, 143 (2012); accord, Henderson, 562 U. S., at
438–439. And, here, there is good reason to infer that the
linguistic contrast between §1252(d)(1) and neighboring
provisions is meaningful, not haphazard: Unlike other provisions,
§1252(d)(1) concerns exhaustion, and its language tracks
exhaustion’s usual nonjurisdictional status.

															Taken together, these two features of
§1252(d)(1)—its content as an exhaustion requirement and
its contrast with related, plainly jurisdictional
provisions—make interpreting §1252(d)(1) as a
claim-processing rule credible enough that we cannot deem it
clearly jurisdictional. Thus, we conclude that §1252(d)(1) is
a non-jurisdictional rule “ ‘merely prescrib[ing]
the method by which the jurisdiction granted the courts by Congress
is to be exercised.’ ” Kontrick, 540
U. S., at 454 (quoting 12 C. Wright, A. Miller, & R.
Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure §3141, p. 485 (2d ed.
1997)).

															C

															The Government offers several reasons why
§1252(d)(1) should nonetheless be characterized as
jurisdictional. Given our clear-statement rule, none is
persuasive.

															First, the Government insists that
§1252(d)(1) is jurisdictional because it is addressed to the
“court” and limits “review.” But that
language does not necessarily refer to the court’s
jurisdiction. Claim-processing rules can also be addressed
to courts. After all, one purpose of such rules is to
“instruct the court on the limits of its discretion” in
handling claims. Kontrick, 540 U. S., at 456.
Provisions limiting “review” can be directions about
the mode or manner of review that are likewise nonjurisdictional in
nature. Examples abound, including elsewhere in the same title and
section as §1252(d)(1). See, e.g., §1252(b)(2)
(“The court of appeals shall review the proceeding on a
typewritten record and on typewritten briefs”);
§1535(a)(3) (“The Court of Appeals shall . . .
review questions of law de novo”); 5 U. S. C.
§706 (“[T]he court shall review the whole record or
those parts of it cited by a party”).

															Moreover, when taking other aspects of the
statute into account, it becomes apparent that §1252(d)(1) is
not using “court” and “review” in a
jurisdictional manner. Section 1252(d)(1) is not even focused
solely on the court. It also requires that “the alien
has exhausted” certain remedies, §1252(d)(1) (emphasis
added), so it “speak[s] to a party’s procedural
obligations” as well, just like a nonjurisdictional
claim-processing rule, Fort Bend County, 587 U. S., at
___ (slip op., at 9) (alteration and internal quotation marks
omitted). In addition, as previously mentioned, Congress had
expressly jurisdictional language close at hand. Supra, at
6–7. Its use of more ambiguous phrasing to impose a
quintessential nonjurisdictional requirement is hardly the
requisite clear statement that §1252(d)(1) is
jurisdictional.

															Second, the Government seeks to advance a theory
that is based on a prior version of §1252(d)(1)’s
exhaustion requirement. A statute that existed before
§1252(d)(1) provided that an “order of deportation
. . . shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has
not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him.”
8 U. S. C. §1105a(c) (1958 ed., Supp. III).
According to the Government, that predecessor provision was
jurisdictional, and Congress merely carried forward that
understanding in §1252(d)(1). But at each step of that theory,
we find doubt, not clarity.

															To begin, the Government has not established
that the predecessor provision was actually jurisdictional. Its
text, standing alone, did not clearly govern the court’s
jurisdiction. So the Government turns to precedent. No precedent of
this Court, however, established that the predecessor exhaustion
provision was jurisdictional (in the sense that we now use the
term).

															The Government principally invokes Stone
v. INS, 514 U.S.
386 (1995), and Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S.
418 (2009). Both cases described portions of the Immigration
and Nationality Act that contained §1252(d)(1)’s
predecessor as “jurisdictional.” Stone, 514
U. S., at 399, 405; Nken, 556 U. S., at 424. But
“[j]urisdiction, the Court has observed, is a word of many,
too many, meanings,” and courts “have more than
occasionally” used it to describe rules beyond those
governing a court’s adjudicatory authority. Fort Bend
County, 587 U. S., at ___–___, and n. 4 (slip
op., at 5–6, and n. 4) (internal quotation marks
omitted).

															Neither Stone nor Nken attends to
the distinction between “jurisdictional” rules (as we
understand them today) and nonjurisdictional but mandatory ones.
Indeed, Stone predates our cases, starting principally with
Arbaugh in 2006, that “bring some discipline to the
use of th[e] term” “jurisdictional.”
Henderson, 562 U. S., at 435. Nken came later,
but it never addressed the Arbaugh line of cases. And in
both Stone and Nken, whether the provisions were
jurisdictional “was not central to the case.” Reed
Elsevier, 559 U. S., at 161. On top of all that, neither
case addressed the exhaustion requirement specifically. Instead,
both merely mentioned the section of the Immigration and
Nationality Act that housed the exhaustion requirement.
Stone, 514 U. S., at 399, 405; Nken, 556
U. S., at 424. Stone and Nken therefore cannot
be read to establish the predecessor exhaustion requirement as
jurisdictional.

															The Government also points to pre-Arbaugh
decisions by lower courts characterizing the predecessor exhaustion
provision as jurisdictional. Brief for Respondent 21, n. 6
(collecting cases). We have held, however, that pre-Arbaugh
lower court cases interpreting a related provision are not enough
to make clear that a rule is jurisdictional. MOAC Mall Holdings
LLC v. Transform Holdco LLC, 598 U. S. ___, ___
(2023) (slip op., at 14); Wilkins, 598 U. S., at 165;
Boechler, 596 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7–8);
Reed Elsevier, 559 U. S., at 167–169.

															Further weakening the Government’s
reliance on the claimed jurisdictional status of
§1252(d)(1)’s predecessor is the fact that when it
enacted §1252(d)(1), Congress did not even recodify that prior
provision exactly. Instead, Congress altered the formulation that,
according to the Government, had been understood as a
jurisdictional rule. Compare 8 U. S. C. §1105a(c)
(1958 ed., Supp. III) (a deportation order “shall not be
reviewed by any court if ”) with 8 U. S. C.
§1252(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. II) (“[a] court may review
a final order of removal only if ”). And having gone to
the trouble of rewriting the provision, Congress still chose
not to use the more expressly jurisdictional formulation that it
utilized elsewhere. Supra, at 6–7. All of this is
inconsistent with the Government’s theory that Congress
understood the predecessor provision to be jurisdictional and
carried that forward in §1252(d)(1).

															Finally, the Government suggests that
§1252(d)(1) is jurisdictional simply because it falls within
§1252. Section 1252 is the exclusive source of jurisdiction
for immigration cases like this one, the Government contends, so
each of §1252’s limits must be jurisdictional. Brief for
Respondent 17–18.[7] This
logical leap falls short. Any foreclosure of sources of
jurisdiction outside §1252 does not tell us which
provisions within §1252 are essential jurisdictional
prerequisites. And even if some provisions in a statutory section
qualify as jurisdictional, that does not suffice to establish that
all others are. Sebelius, 568 U. S., at 155;
Gonzalez, 565 U. S., at 146–147. This argument,
like the Government’s others, fails to demonstrate that it is
“clea[r]” that Congress made §1252(d)(1)’s
exhaustion requirement jurisdictional. Arbaugh, 546
U. S., at 515.

															*  *  *

															Because §1252(d)(1)’s exhaustion
requirement is not jurisdictional, it is subject to waiver and
forfeiture. See Nutraceutical Corp. v. Lambert, 586
U. S. ___, ___–___ (2019) (slip op., at 3–4). The
Court of Appeals erred in holding otherwise.

															III

															The Government now suggests that even if
§1252(d)(1) is not jurisdictional, the Court of Appeals’
sua sponte requirement that Santos-Zacaria comply with
§1252(d)(1) can be justified on alternative grounds. Brief for
Respondent 26, n. 7. We do not reach that issue. Instead, we
hold that, even if §1252(d)(1) were applied here,
Santos-Zacaria has done enough to satisfy it. That is,
§1252(d)(1) does not require that Santos-Zacaria seek
reconsideration from the Board, as the Court of Appeals
believed.

															A

															Under the plain language of §1252(d)(1),
a noncitizen must “exhaus[t] all administrative remedies
available to the alien as of right.” The parties here dispute
whether, to fulfill this requirement, Santos-Zacaria had to seek a
certain form of review of her legal claim: reconsideration by the
Board of Immigration Appeals. Whether exhaustion for
§1252(d)(1) purposes requires seeking Board reconsideration
turns on the meaning of “remedies available . . .
as of right,” which, in turn, relates to the specifics of the
Board’s reconsideration process.

															Pursuant to that process, after the Board
renders a final decision, it can provide additional review via
reconsideration and its close cousin, reopening. Reconsideration
addresses “errors of law or fact in the previous
order,” while reopening accounts for “new facts.”
§§1229a(c)(6)–(7); see 8 CFR §1003.2
(2022).[8]

															Meanwhile, it is well established that a remedy
is not available “as of right” if it is discretionary.
“As of right” is a familiar phrase in the law, meaning
“[b]y virtue of a legal entitlement.” Black’s Law
Dictionary 141 (11th ed. 2019). And in the context relevant
here—review of a legal claim—the phrase means review
that is guaranteed, not contingent on permission or discretion. An
“appeal as of right” is one over which the court
“has no discretion to deny review.” Id., at 121.
By contrast, “discretionary review” is review
“that is not a matter of right” and instead requires
“permission.” Id., at 1579. Under the Federal
Rules, for instance, an appeal “as of right,” Fed. Rule
App. Proc. 3, stands in contrast to an appeal “within
the [court’s] discretion,” Fed. Rule App. Proc. 5.
To take another example, this Court’s certiorari review is
“not a matter of right, but of judicial discretion.”
Supreme Court Rule 10. Thus, because §1252(d)(1) requires
exhausting only remedies available “as of right,” it
does not require exhausting discretionary review.

															Board reconsideration and reopening are
discretionary. By regulation, today and at the time of
§1252(d)(1)’s enactment, “[t]he decision to grant
or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the discretion
of the Board.” 8 CFR §1003.2(a) (2022); 8 CFR §3.2
(1996); 61 Fed. Reg. 18904 (1996); see Dada v.
Mukasey, 554 U.S.
1, 12–13 (2008) (tracing history of discretion to reopen
back to 1916). That means a noncitizen can request
reconsideration. But only if “the motion to reconsider is
granted” does the Board proceed to make the “decision
upon such reconsideration” as to whether to “affirm,
modify, or reverse the original decision.” 8 CFR
§1003.2(i). And, again, whether to grant the motion to
reconsider, and thus proceed to such review, is up to the Board in
its discretion. §1003.2(a); In re O-S-G-, 24
I. & N. Dec. 56, 57 (BIA 2006) (“[W]e have
authority to deny a motion to reconsider as a matter of
discretion”); cf. §1003.2(a) (“The Board has
discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has
made out a prima facie case for relief ”).

															Because Board reconsideration (like reopening)
is a discretionary form of review, it is not available to the
noncitizen “as of right.” Section 1252(d)(1) therefore
does not require a noncitizen to pursue it.

															B

															The Government acknowledges that because
§1252(d)(1) requires only exhaustion of remedies
“available . . . as of right,” “a
noncitizen need not exhaust ‘discretionary’
remedies.” Brief for Respondent 39. It also acknowledges that
Board reconsideration is discretionary. Id., at 41,
n. 11; Brief in Opposition 15–16. Still, the Government
tries to squeeze reconsideration into the statutory requirement of
remedies available “as of right.” We are
unpersuaded.

															According to the Government, §1252(d)(1)
requires seeking reconsideration because a noncitizen has the
“right” to file a motion to reconsider. But that
is a peculiar understanding of a remedy available “as of
right.” The Government identifies no other provision that
uses “as of right” to describe the right to file a
motion that appeals to the decisionmaker’s discretion. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 35. A discretionary appeal, for example, is not “as
of right” just because a litigant has a right to file a
petition for permission to appeal. See, e.g., 28
U. S. C. §1292(b); Fed. Rule Civ.
Proc. 23(f ).

															That understanding of “as of right”
is so unnatural that even the Government does not fully embrace it,
as its view of other forms of relief reveals. Cancellation of
removal, voluntary departure, and adjustment of status are
discretionary types of immigration relief available to noncitizens
only as a matter of grace, not entitlement. 8 U. S. C.
§§1229b, 1229c, 1255; see Kucana v. Holder,
558 U.S.
233, 247–248 (2010). And the Government accordingly
volunteers them as examples of remedies “not
‘available’ to [a noncitizen] ‘as of
right.’ ” Brief for Respondent 39 (quoting
§1252(d)(1)). Yet eligible noncitizens can file requests for
those forms of relief. See §§1229b, 1229c, 1255; 8 CFR
§§1240.20, 1240.26, 1245.1. Even the Government does not
say these are remedies available “as of right” just
because noncitizens have a right to request them.

															The Government’s reading has a further
flaw. Understanding the motion for reconsideration as a
remedy “available . . . as of right” does not
just read “as of right” unnaturally; it reads it out of
§1252(d)(1) altogether. Under the Government’s view,
there is a remedy that is “available . . . as of
right” here because the noncitizen is entitled to request
reconsideration by filing a motion. See Brief for Respondent
38–39. But if a noncitizen could not request
reconsideration, there would be no remedy “available”
for the noncitizen to exhaust. The statute’s additional
requirement that the remedy be available “as of right”
would be entirely superfluous. Instead, we read the phrase
“as of right” to do its usual work in the context of
review of a legal claim: distinguishing between discretionary and
nondiscretionary review.

															Switching gears, the Government suggests that
§1252(d)(1) excludes only remedies made discretionary by
statute, while reconsideration and reopening are made
discretionary by regulation. Id., at 39–40.
True, Congress elsewhere focused on discretion specified by
statute. We considered such a provision in Kucana v.
Holder, addressing administrative actions
“ ‘the authority for which is specified under
this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney
General.’ ” 558 U. S., at 237 (quoting
§1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)). But §1252(d)(1) draws no such line.
It simply covers remedies that are “available
. . . as of right.” Whether that
characteristic is established by statute or regulation makes no
difference.

															It is especially implausible that
§1252(d)(1) treats reconsideration and reopening as
“available . . . as of right” just
because the discretion whether to grant them is not specified by
statute. As we noted previously, when Congress enacted
§1252(d)(1), regulation and historical practice had already
firmly established Board reconsideration and reopening as
discretionary. Supra, at 13; 8 CFR §3.2 (1996);
Dada, 554 U. S., at 12–13. We have no reason to
think §1252(d)(1) categorizes those well-understood
discretionary forms of review as “available . . .
as of right.”

															The Government also posits that reconsideration
and reopening are “available . . . as of
right” because in certain cases, denying the
noncitizen’s motion would be reversible as an abuse of
discretion. See Brief for Respondent 41, n. 11; Tr. of Oral
Arg. 39. All this shows is that the agency’s discretion has
limits. That is no surprise. “Traditionally, . . .
decisions on matters of discretion are reviewable for abuse of
discretion.” Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health
Management System, Inc., 572 U.S.
559, 563 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). They remain
“matters of discretion” all the same.

															Finally, not only do the Government’s
theories fail on their own terms, but they also share a common
problem: They would render the statutory scheme incoherent. The
Government urges that reconsideration (or at least a motion to
reconsider) is an “administrative remed[y] available
. . . as of right,” §1252(d)(1). Yet
§1252(d)(1) requires “exhaus[ting] all” such
remedies, without exception. So if the Government is correct,
noncitizens would need to seek reconsideration from the Board
before obtaining judicial review in every case. But that obligation
is incompatible with the rest of the statute’s design.

															In particular, elsewhere, the statute provides
for a process that does not require reconsideration before
judicial review. Noncitizens are authorized to seek judicial review
of an agency order and, additionally, to seek administrative review
of the agency’s decision via a “motion to reopen or
reconsider the order.” See §1252(b)(6). The statute
gives noncitizens the same 30-day window from the agency
order to seek judicial review and administrative reconsideration.
§§1252(b)(1), 1229a(c)(6)(B). The statute is thus
designed around pursuing judicial review and agency reconsideration
in parallel, not waiting to seek judicial review until after
reconsideration is complete. With respect to a prior version of
this scheme, we observed that, if a noncitizen seeks
reconsideration, the statute plainly “contemplates”
that “two separate petitions for [judicial] review will exist
in the normal course”: one from the agency’s initial
order and a later one from its decision on the reconsideration
motion. Stone, 514 U. S., at 393–395.

															If reconsideration were required for exhaustion,
however, only one petition—the later one—would
pass muster. The first petition would be premature. So the
Government’s interpretation of remedies “available
. . . as of right” would not just flood the Board
with reconsideration motions that noncitizens otherwise would not
file; it would also flood the courts with pointless premature
petitions—petitions that the statutory scheme would provide
for noncitizens to file, on the one hand, yet deem unexhausted, on
the other. We decline to interpret the statute to be so at war with
itself.

															C

															Conceding that it “would be inconsistent
with” the design of the statute to require noncitizens to
always file a motion to reconsider for exhaustion purposes,
the Government instead would require such a motion only
sometimes: when the noncitizen is raising an issue not
previously presented to the agency. Brief for Respondent
36–37. According to the Government, a noncitizen must give
the agency an opportunity to consider an issue before raising it in
court. So in the Government’s view, a motion to reconsider is
required when it is the only remaining mechanism for presenting a
new issue, but not when the noncitizen has already presented every
issue to the agency in other ways.[9]

															That is not the scheme Congress adopted. Section
1252(d)(1) does not require noncitizens to give the agency an
opportunity to consider an objection using every mechanism
available. It requires exhausting only administrative remedies
“available . . . as of right.” And we do not
see how seeking reconsideration can qualify sometimes and not
others. Instead, for the reasons already explained, it does not
qualify at all. Supra, at 12–16.

															Nor would the Government’s approach cure
the inconsistency identified above: The statutory scheme would
still produce pointless, unexhausted petitions for review. See
supra, at 16–17. Consider, for example, a noncitizen
whose only issue for judicial review is one she had not raised
previously because the Board’s decision introduced the issue.
Under the Government’s view, §1252(d)(1) bars judicial
review until after she pursues reconsideration. Yet, elsewhere, the
statutory scheme contemplates that she immediately petition for
judicial review of the Board’s initial, prereconsideration
decision. See ibid.; §§1252(b)(1), (6),
1229a(c)(6)(B). Any such petition is a worthless exercise, however,
if it is unexhausted by definition, as the Government
maintains.

															The Government’s approach would also
introduce practical difficulties. If motions to reconsider are
required only sometimes, what cases qualify? In this very case, the
members of the Court of Appeals panel disagreed about whether a
motion to reconsider was required under the Government’s
rule, largely because they differed over whether Santos-Zacaria had
asserted adequately to the Board earlier that new factfinding would
be impermissible. Compare 22 F. 4th, at 573 (majority opinion),
with id., at 575 (Higginson, J., dissenting). And how are
noncitizens—already navigating a complex bureaucracy, often
pro se and in a foreign language—to tell the
difference? The Government’s position presents a world of
administrability headaches for courts, traps for unwary
noncitizens, and mountains of reconsideration requests for the
Board (filed out of an abundance of caution by noncitizens unsure
of the need to seek reconsideration). For the reasons discussed, we
are confident that Congress did not adopt such a scheme.[10]

															*  *  *

															Section 1252(d)(1)’s exhaustion
requirement is not jurisdictional and does not oblige a noncitizen
to seek discretionary review, like reconsideration before the Board
of Immigration Appeals. We vacate the portion of the judgment of
the Court of Appeals dismissing Santos-Zacaria’s petition for
review and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

															It is so ordered.

 There are many examples.
To name a few, we deemed exhaustion requirements nonjurisdictional
in Fort Bend County v. Davis, 587 U. S. ___, ___
(2019) (slip op., at 9) (Title VII, 42 U. S. C.
§§2000e–5(e)(1), (f )(1)), EPA v.
EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 572 U.S.
489, 511–512 (2014) (Clean Air Act, 42 U. S. C.
§7607(d)(7)(B)), Union Pacific R. Co. v.
Locomotive Engineers, 558 U.S.
67, 82 (2009) (Railway Labor Act, 45 U. S. C. §152),
and Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S.
81, 101 (2006) (Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42
U. S. C. §1997e(a); see also Jones v.
Bock, 549 U.S.
199, 211–217 (2007)). And we have repeatedly observed
that exhaustion is usually nonjurisdictional. See, e.g.,
Patchak v. Zinke, 583 U. S. ___, ___ (2018)
(plurality opinion) (slip op., at 7) (naming “an exhaustion
requirement” as a typical claim-processing rule);
Jones, 549 U. S., at 212 (exhaustion is
“usual[ly]” regarded “as an affirmative
defense”).

 For the proposition that
§1252 is the exclusive source of jurisdiction, the Government
relies on two provisions. Section 1252(a)(5) states that “a
petition for review filed . . . in accordance with this
section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review
of ” certain removal orders. Section 1252(b)(9) states
that “[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact
. . . arising from” removal proceedings
“shall be available only in judicial review of a final order
under this section,” and, with certain exceptions, “no
court shall have jurisdiction” under other
provisions.
8
 Reconsideration and
reopening are related forms of relief, and the parties’
arguments about §1252(d)(1) address both. But reconsideration
is the pertinent one here because Santos-Zacaria alleges the Board
committed an error of law.
9
 Here, for example,
Santos-Zacaria objects that the Board conducted impermissible
factfinding. Because that issue arose in the Board’s
decision, the Government says, Santos-Zacaria had not previously
raised her objection to the Board but she could have done so in a
motion to reconsider. In the Government’s view, she needed to
take that option.
10  Under
our holding, §1252(d)(1) does not require a noncitizen to seek
discretionary Board review to raise issues that she had not raised
to the Board before. To that limited extent, we reject the
Government’s contention that Congress “preclud[ed] the
courts from considering any issue that had not been presented to
the Board in the first instance,” Brief for Respondent 31.
But beyond that, we do not address more generally what obligations
noncitizens have to present specific issues when appearing before
the agency.
