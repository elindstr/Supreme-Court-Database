															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 20–157

															_________________

															EDWARD A. CANIGLIA, PETITIONER v.  ROBERT F. STROM, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit

															[May 17, 2021]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion in full.  I write separately to underscore and elaborate on The Chief Justice’s point that the Court’s decision does not prevent police officers from taking reasonable steps to assist those who are inside a home and in need of aid.  See ante, at 1 (Roberts, C. J., concurring).  For example, as I will explain, police officers may enter a home without a warrant in circumstances where they are reasonably trying to prevent a potential suicide or to help an elderly person who has been out of contact and may have fallen and suffered a serious injury.

															Ratified in 1791 and made applicable to the States in 1868, the
 
Fourth Amendment protects the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”  As the constitutional text establishes, the “ultimate touchstone of the
 
Fourth Amendment is reasonableness.”  Riley v. California,

573 U.S. 373, 381 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court has said that a warrant supported by probable cause is ordinarily required for law enforcement officers to enter a home.  See U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.  But drawing on common-law analogies and a commonsense appraisal of what is “reasonable,” the Court has recognized various situations where a warrant is not required.  For example, the exigent circumstances doctrine allows officers to enter a home without a warrant in certain situations, including: to fight a fire and investigate its cause; to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence; to engage in hot pursuit of a fleeing felon or prevent a suspect’s escape; to address a threat to the safety of law enforcement officers or the general public; to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant; or to protect an occupant who is threatened with serious injury.  See Mitchell v. Wisconsin, 588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 6); City and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan,

575 U.S. 600, 612 (2015); Kentucky v. King,

563 U.S. 452, 460, 462 (2011); Michigan v. Fisher,

558 U.S. 45, 47 (2009) (per curiam); Brigham City v. Stuart,

547 U.S. 398, 403 (2006); Minnesota v. Olson,

495 U.S. 91, 100 (1990); Michigan v. Clifford,

464 U.S. 287, 293, and n. 4 (1984) (plurality opinion); Mincey v. Arizona,

437 U.S. 385, 392–394 (1978); Michigan v. Tyler,

436 U.S. 499, 509–510 (1978); United States v. Santana,

427 U.S. 38, 42–43 (1976); Warden, Md. Penitentiary v. Hayden,

387 U.S. 294, 298–299 (1967); Ker v. California,

374 U.S. 23, 40–41 (1963) (plurality opinion).

															Over the years, many courts, like the First Circuit in this case, have relied on what they have labeled a “community caretaking” doctrine to allow warrantless entries into the home for a non-investigatory purpose, such as to prevent a suicide or to conduct a welfare check on an older individual who has been out of contact.  But as the Court today explains, any such standalone community caretaking doctrine was primarily devised for searches of cars, not homes.  Ante, at 3–4; see Cady v. Dombrowski,

413 U.S. 433, 447–448 (1973).

															That said, this
 
Fourth Amendment issue is more labeling than substance.  The Court’s
 
Fourth Amendment case law already recognizes the exigent circumstances doctrine, which allows an officer to enter a home without a warrant if the “exigencies of the situation make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that the warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the
 
Fourth Amendment.”  Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also ante, at 3.  As relevant here, one such recognized “exigency” is the “need to assist persons who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury.”  Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 403; see also ante, at 1 (Roberts, C. J., concurring).  The
 
Fourth Amendment allows officers to enter a home if they have “an objectively reasonable basis for believing” that such help is needed, and if the officers’ actions inside the home are reasonable under the circumstances.  Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 406; see also Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U. S., at 47–48.

															This case does not require us to explore all the contours of the exigent circumstances doctrine as applied to emergency-aid situations because the officers here disclaimed reliance on that doctrine.  But to avoid any confusion going forward, I think it important to briefly describe how the doctrine applies to some heartland emergency-aid situations.

															As Chief Judge Livingston has cogently explained, although this doctrinal area does not draw much attention from courts or scholars, “municipal police spend a good deal of time responding to calls about missing persons, sick neighbors, and premises left open at night.”  Livingston, Police, Community Caretaking, and the
 
Fourth Amendment, 1998 U. Chi. Leg. Forum 261, 263 (1998).  And as she aptly noted, “the responsibility of police officers to search for missing persons, to mediate disputes, and to aid the ill or injured has never been the subject of serious debate; nor has” the “responsibility of police to provide services in an emergency.”  Id., at 302.

															Consistent with that reality, the Court’s exigency precedents, as I read them, permit warrantless entries when police officers have an objectively reasonable basis to believe that there is a current, ongoing crisis for which it is reasonable to act now.  See, e.g., Sheehan, 575 U. S., at 612; Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U. S., at 48–49; Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 406–407.  The officers do not need to show that the harm has already occurred or is mere moments away, because knowing that will often be difficult if not impossible in cases involving, for example, a person who is currently suicidal or an elderly person who has been out of contact and may have fallen.  If someone is at risk of serious harm and it is reasonable for officers to intervene now, that is enough for the officers to enter.

															A few (non-exhaustive) examples illustrate the point.

															Suppose that a woman calls a healthcare hotline or 911 and says that she is contemplating suicide, that she has firearms in her home, and that she might as well die.  The operator alerts the police, and two officers respond by driving to the woman’s home.  They knock on the door but do not receive a response.  May the officers enter the home?  Of course.

															The exigent circumstances doctrine applies because the officers have an “objectively reasonable basis” for believing that an occupant is “seriously injured or threatened with such injury.”  Id., at 400, 403; cf. Sheehan, 575 U. S., at 612 (officers could enter the room of a mentally ill person who had locked herself inside with a knife).  After all, a suicidal individual in such a scenario could kill herself at any moment.  The
 
Fourth Amendment does not require officers to stand idly outside as the suicide takes place.[1]

															Consider another example.  Suppose that an elderly man is uncharacteristically absent from Sunday church services and repeatedly fails to answer his phone throughout the day and night.  A concerned relative calls the police and asks the officers to perform a wellness check.  Two officers drive to the man’s home.  They knock but receive no response.  May the officers enter the home?  Of course.

															Again, the officers have an “objectively reasonable basis” for believing that an occupant is “seriously injured or threatened with such injury.”  Brigham City, 547 U. S., at 400, 403.  Among other possibilities, the elderly man may have fallen and hurt himself, a common cause of death or serious injury for older individuals.  The
 
Fourth Amendment does not prevent the officers from entering the home and checking on the man’s well-being.[2]

															To be sure, courts, police departments, and police officers alike must take care that officers’ actions in those kinds of cases are reasonable under the circumstances.  But both of those examples and others as well, such as cases involving unattended young children inside a home, illustrate the kinds of warrantless entries that are perfectly constitutional under the exigent circumstances doctrine, in my view.

															With those observations, I join the Court’s opinion in full.
Notes
1
 In 2019 in the United States, 47,511 people committed suicide.  That number is more than double the number of annual homicides.  See Dept. of Health and Human Servs., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, D. Stone, C. Jones, & K. Mack, Changes in Suicide Rates––United States, 2018–2019, 70 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Rep. 261, 263 (2021) (MMWR); Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Report, Crime in the United States, 2019, p. 2 (2020). 

2
 In 2018 in the United States, approximately 32,000 older adults died from falls.  Falls are also the leading cause of injury for older adults.  B. Moreland, R. Kakara, & A.
