															CHARLES BORDEN, Jr., PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[June 10, 2021]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

															This case forces us to choose between aggravating a past error and committing a new one.  I must choose the former.  Although I am “reluctant to magnify the burdens that our [erroneous] jurisprudence imposes,” Ring v. Arizona,

536 U.S. 584, 610 (2002) (Scalia, J., concurring), I conclude that the particular provision at issue here does not encompass petitioner’s conviction for reckless aggravated assault, even though the consequences of today’s judgment are at odds with the larger statutory scheme.  The need to make this choice is yet another consequence of the Court’s vagueness-doctrine cases like Johnson v. United States,

576 U.S. 591 (2015).

															I

															The Armed Career Criminal Act provides enhanced penalties for criminals convicted of certain firearms offenses who have at least “three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.”

18 U. S. C. §924(e)(1).  As relevant here, the Act defines a “violent felony” as a “crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year” that either “has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another” (the elements clause) or “involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another” (the residual clause).  §924(e)(2)(B).[1]

															The question presented here is whether the elements clause encompasses petitioner’s conviction under Tennessee law for reckless aggravated assault.  It does not.  The plurality focuses on the latter part of the operative language: “against the person of another.”  I rest my analysis instead on a separate phrase: “use of physical force.”  As I have explained before, a crime that can be committed through mere recklessness does not have as an element the “use of physical force” because that phrase “has a well-understood meaning applying only to intentional acts designed to cause harm.”  Voisine v. United States,

579 U.S. 686, ___, ___ (2016) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2, 16).  The elements clause does not encompass petitioner’s conviction because the statute under which he was convicted could be violated through mere recklessness.

															But although the Court’s conclusion that petitioner’s conviction does not satisfy the elements clause is sound, the implication that he is something other than an “armed career criminal” is not.  The state law here prohibits “[r]ecklessly . . . [c]aus[ing] serious bodily injury to another.”  Tenn. Code Ann. §39–13–102(a)(2)(A) (2003).  That offense would satisfy the residual clause because it “involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”  §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  So although the elements clause does not make petitioner an armed career criminal, the residual clause would.

															The problem is that Johnson held that the residual clause is “unconstitutionally vague” and thus unenforceable.  576 U. S., at 597.  This left prosecutors and courts in a bind.  Many offenders had committed violent felonies, but Johnson foreclosed invoking the residual clause to establish that fact.  The workaround was to read the elements clause broadly.  But the text of that clause cannot bear such a broad reading.

															II

															There is a straightforward solution to this dilemma—overrule Johnson.[2]  Johnson declared the residual clause not just too vague as applied in that case but also facially vague—meaning that the residual clause could never be employed consistent with the Constitution.  That decision was wrong for at least two reasons.

															First, to “pronounce that the statute is unconstitutional in all applications . . . seems to me no more than an advisory opinion—which a federal court should never issue at all.”  Chicago v. Morales,

527 U.S. 41, 77 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Courts have no authority to “ ‘strik[e] down’ ” statutory text.  See United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6); see also Mitchell, The Writ-of-Erasure Fallacy, 104 Va. L. Rev. 933, 936 (2018).  Nor may courts resolve “general questions of legality” by “provid[ing] relief beyond the parties to the case.”  Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U. S. ___, ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 6, 8).  A court may only “ ‘adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.’ ”  United States v. Raines,

362 U.S. 17, 21 (1960).  When faced with a criminal statute too vague for the case at hand, the right answer likely is to apply the rule of lenity and “declin[e] to apply [the statute] on a case-by-case basis.”  Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4).  By, instead, purporting to decide theoretical cases for theoretical parties not before the Court, Johnson departed from foundational limits on the judicial power.

															Second, even assuming that the petitioner’s plea for facial relief was cognizable, Johnson deviated from the usual legal standard.  To obtain facial relief, a plaintiff normally “must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.”  E.g., United States v. Salerno,

481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987).  That is because a facial challenge, if successful, has the same effect as “nullify[ing]” a statute.  Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.,

546 U.S. 320, 329 (2006).  The petitioner in Johnson did not satisfy that standard.  Indeed, the Johnson majority acknowledged that “there will be straightforward cases under the residual clause, because some crimes clearly pose a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.”  576 U. S., at 602.

															These errors show that this Court in Johnson not only misapplied the Due Process Clause but also exercised the legislative role.  Legislatures alone have authority “to prescribe general rules for the government of society.”  Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 136 (1810).  Courts, by contrast, have authority to provide only those “remed[ies that are] tailored to redress the plaintiff ’s particular injury.”  Gill v. Whitford, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 21).  Simply put, where enforcement of a law would conflict with the Constitution, a court has authority under the Supremacy Clause to enjoin enforcement, but a court cannot, consistent with separation of powers, enjoin enforcement of a statute where enforcement would be lawful.  Johnson, however, conducted the “quintessentially legislative work” of altering the legal rules that would apply in cases where the residual clause could lawfully be enforced.  See Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U. S., at 329–330.

															III

															I hesitate to give petitioner the benefit of Johnson, because his crime is a “violent felony” as Congress defined the term.  Indeed, in other contexts, I have resisted exacerbating similar errors.  See Pepper v. United States,

562 U.S. 476, 518–520 (2011) (dissenting opinion) (declining to apply this Court’s erroneous holding that the Sentencing Guidelines are never mandatory).  Yet I reluctantly conclude that I must accept Johnson in this case because to do otherwise would create further confusion and division about whether state laws prohibiting reckless assault satisfy the elements clause.[3]  See Vance v. Ball State Univ.,

570 U.S. 421, 450–451 (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring).  I therefore concur in the judgment.
Notes
1
 The definition also covers any felony that “is burglary, arson, or extortion” or “involves use of explosives.”  §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). 

2
  Johnson has already upended many statutes.  United States v. Davis, 588 U. S. ___ (2019); Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U. S. ___ (2018); Welch v. United States,

578 U.S. 120 (2016) (making Johnson retroactive).  And the parties agree that more are likely to follow. 

3
 Voting to affirm petitioner’s sentence here would lead to a 5 to 4 judgment that petitioner’s sentence is correct even though five Justices conclude that Tennessee reckless aggravated assault does not satisfy the elements clause.  That kind of fractured reasoning would be difficult for lower courts to apply.
