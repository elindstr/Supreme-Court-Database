															This case was argued on the 20th and 23d of November, 1855, and decided December 14, 1885.   116 U. S. 116 U.S. 55.  The reasons for setting aside the judgment and dismissing the writ of error are stated in the opinion of the Court.

															MR. JUSTICE BLATCHFORD delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The decision in Snow v. United States, ante, p.  118 U.

															The writ of error is dismissed.
