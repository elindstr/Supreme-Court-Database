To the admission of this evidence the defendant took a bill of exceptions, and brought a writ of error.  March 1st. The transcript of the record was submitted to the Court without argument, who affirmed the judgment, with ten per cent damages and costs, observing that the meaning of the agreement was, that each party should procure the work to be done, and not that they should do it personally.
