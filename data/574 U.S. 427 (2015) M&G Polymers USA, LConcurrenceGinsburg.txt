															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															M&G POLYMERS USA, LLC, etÂ al., PETITIONERS
v.HOBERT FREEL TACKETT etÂ al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the sixth circuit

															[January 26, 2015]

															Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor,
and Justice Kagan join,concurring.

															Todayâ€™s decision rightly holds that courts
must apply ordinary contract principles, shorn of presumptions, to
determine whether retiree health-care benefits survive the
expiration of a collective-bargaining agreement. Under the
â€œcardinal principleâ€ of contract
interpretation, â€œthe intention of the parties,
to be gathered from the whole instrument, must
prevail.â€ 11 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts
Â§30:2, p. 27 (4th ed. 2012) (Williston). To determine
what the contracting parties intended, a court must examine the
entire agreement in light of relevant industry-specific
â€œcustoms, practices, usages, and
terminology.â€ Id., Â§30:4, at
55â€“58. When the intent of the parties is
unambiguously expressed in the contract, that expression controls,
and the courtâ€™s inquiry should proceed no
further. Id., Â§30:6, at
98â€“104. But when the contract is ambiguous, a
court may consider extrinsic evidence to determine the intentions
of the parties. Id., Â§30:7, at
116â€“124.

															Contrary to M&Gâ€™s assertion, Brief for
Petitioner 25, no rule requires â€œclear and
expressâ€ language in order to show that parties
intended health-care benefits to vest.
â€œ[C]onstraints upon the employer after the
expiration date of a collective-bargaining agreement,â€
we have observed, may be derived from the
agreementâ€™s â€œexplicit
terms,â€ but they â€œmay arise as well
from . . . implied terms of the expired agreement.â€
Litton Financial Printing Div., Litton Business Systems,
Inc. v. NLRB,501 U. S. 190,203,207 (1991).

															On remand, the Court of Appeals should examine the entire
agreement to determine whether the parties intended retiree
health-care benefits to vest. 11 Williston Â§30:4, at
55â€“57. Because the retirees have a vested,
lifetime right to a monthly pension, App. 366, a provision stating
that retirees â€œwill receiveâ€
health-care benefits if they are â€œreceiving a
monthly pensionâ€ is relevant to this examination.
Id., at 415. So is a â€œsurvivor
benefitsâ€ clause instructing that if a retiree dies,
her surviving spouse will â€œcontinue to receive
[the retireeâ€™s health-care] benefits . . .
until death or remarriage.â€ Id., at 417. If,
after considering all relevant contractual language in light of
industry practices, the Court of Appeals concludes that the
contract is ambiguous, it may turn to extrinsic
evidenceâ€”for example, the
partiesâ€™ bargaining history. The Court of
Appeals, however, must conduct the foregoing inspection without
Yard-Manâ€™s â€œthumb on
the scale in favor of vested retiree benefits.â€
Ante, at 10; see International Union, United Auto,
Aerospace, & Agricultural Implement Workers of Am. v.
Yard-Man, Inc., 716 F.Â 2d 1476 (1983).

															Because I understand the Courtâ€™s opinion to
be consistent with these basic rules of contract interpretation, I
join it.
