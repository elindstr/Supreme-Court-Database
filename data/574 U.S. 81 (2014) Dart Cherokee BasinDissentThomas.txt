															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															DART CHEROKEE BASIN OPERATING COMPANY, LLC, etÂ al.,
PETITIONERS v. BRANDON W. OWENS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the tenth circuit

															[December 15, 2014]

															Justice Thomas, dissenting.

															I agree with Justice Scalia that the merits of the District
Courtâ€™s decision are not properly before the
Court. I write only to point out another, more fundamental, defect
in the Courtâ€™s disposition: We lack jurisdiction
to review even the Court of Appealsâ€™ denial of
permission to appeal.

															Congress has granted this Court jurisdiction to review
â€œ[c]ases in the courts of appealsâ€
by writ of certiorari.28 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§1254. Purporting to act pursuant to this grant of
jurisdiction, the majority today reviews the decision of the Court
of Appeals to deny an application for permission to appeal a remand
order. But such an application is not a case: It
â€œÂ â€˜does not
assert a grievance against anyone, does not seek remedy or redress
for any legal injury, and does not even require a
â€œpartyâ€ on the other
side.â€™Â â€
Miller-El v. Cockrell,537 U. S. 322,355 (2003)
(Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting Hohn v. United
States,524 U. S. 236,256 (1998) (Scalia, J., dissenting)).

															To justify its action here, the majority quietly extends an
opinion of this Court holding that applications for certificates of
appealability (COAs) in the federal habeas context are
â€œcases.â€ Hohn, supra.
Hohn was wrongly decided, and the
majorityâ€™s uncritical extension of its holding
only compounds the error. Hohn rests tenuously on the
conclusion that the determination that must be made on an
application for a COA is more like a threshold determination than a
separate judicial proceeding. See id., at
246â€“248. The basis for that conclusion, if any
exists, must rest on features unique to the COA:
â€œThe COA determination
.Â .Â . requires an overview of the
claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their
merits.â€ Miller-El, supra, at 336
(emphasis added). The best argument one could make in favor of
Hohn is that, because a courtâ€™s decision
on an application for a COA turns on the strength of the
applicantâ€™s grievance and his entitlement to
relief, the application absorbs the case-like qualities of the
underlying merits case. See Hohn, supra, at 248.

															No such osmosis could transform an application for permission to
appeal a remand order into a â€œcase.â€
As Justice Scalia explains, the decision whether to permit such an
appeal requires no assessment of the merits of a remand order. See
ante, at 2 (dissenting opinion). The application here is
nothing more than a request for discretionary permission to seek
review. See Miller-El, supra, at 355 (Thomas, J.,
dissenting). The Tenth Circuit having denied that permission, no
â€œcaseâ€ ever arrived
â€œin the court of appeals.â€ I would
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
