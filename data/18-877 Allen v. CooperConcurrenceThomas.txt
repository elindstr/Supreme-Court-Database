															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 18–877

															_________________

															FREDERICK L. ALLEN, et al., PETITIONERS v. ROY A. COOPER, III, GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															[March 23, 2020]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I agree with the Court’s conclusion that the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act of 1990,

17 U. S. C. §501 et seq., does not validly abrogate States’ sovereign immunity.  But I cannot join the Court’s opinion in its entirety.  I write separately to note two disagreements and one question that remains open for resolution in a future case.

															First, although I agree that Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank,

527 U.S. 627 (1999), is binding precedent, I cannot join the Court’s discussion of stare decisis.  The Court claims we need “ ‘special justification[s]’ ” to overrule precedent because error alone “cannot overcome stare decisis.”  Ante, at 9–10.  That approach “does not comport with our judicial duty under Article III.”  Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 2).  If our decision in Florida Prepaid were demonstrably erroneous, the Court would be obligated to “correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent.”  587 U. S., at ___–___ (same) (slip op., at 8–9).

															Here, adherence to our precedent is warranted because petitioners have not demonstrated that our decision in Florida Prepaid “is incorrect, much less demonstrably erroneous.”  Gamble, 587 U. S., at ___ (same) (slip op., at 17).  The Court in Florida Prepaid correctly concluded that “Congress may not abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to its Article I powers,” including its powers under the Intellectual Property Clause.  527 U. S., at 636 (citing Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,

517 U.S. 44, 72–73 (1996)).  Petitioners’ claims to the contrary are unpersuasive.[1]*

															Second, I do not join the Court’s discussion regarding future copyright legislation.  In my view, we should opine on “only the case before us in light of the record before us.”  Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 15).  We should not purport to advise Congress on how it might exercise its legislative authority, nor give our blessing to hypothetical statutes or legislative records not at issue here.

															Finally, I believe the question whether copyrights are property within the original meaning of the
 
Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause remains open.  The Court relies on Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal,

286 U.S. 123 (1932), to conclude that “[c]opyrights are a form of property.”  Ante, at 11.  But Fox Film Corp. addressed “property” in the context of state tax laws, not the Due Process Clause.  286 U. S., at 128.  And although we stated in Florida Prepaid that patents are “property” for due process purposes, we did not analyze the
 
Fourteenth Amendment’s text, and neither of the cases we cited involved due process.  527 U. S., at 642 (citing Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183, 197 (1857); Consolidated Fruit-Jar Co. v. Wright,

94 U.S. 92, 96 (1877)); see also Merrill, The Landscape of Constitutional Property, 86 Va. L. Rev. 885, 887 (2000) (noting that the “Court has not always been attentive to the ‘property’ threshold” of the Due Process Clauses).  Because the parties agree that petitioners’ copyrights are property, and because the
 
Fourteenth Amendment does not authorize this statute’s abrogation of state sovereign immunity either way, we need not resolve this open question today.  I would, however, be willing to consider the matter in an appropriate case.

															For these reasons, I join all of the Court’s opinion except for the final paragraph in Part II–A and the final paragraph in Part II–B.
Notes
1
*Because I adhere to our precedents regarding Article I and state sovereign immunity, I continue to believe that Central Va. Community College v. Katz,

546 U.S. 356 (2006), was wrongly decided.  See id., at 379–385 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  The Court today rightfully limits that de-cision to the Bankruptcy Clause context, calling it a “good-for-one-clause-only holding.”  Ante, at 9.  I would go a step further and recognize that the Court’s decision in Katz is not good for even that clause.
