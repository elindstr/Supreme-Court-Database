															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															HALLIBURTON CO., et al., PETITIONERS v.
ERICA P. JOHN FUND, INC., fka ARCHDIOCESE OF MILWAUKEE SUPPORTING
FUND, INC.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 23, 2014]

															

															     Justice Ginsburg,
with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor join,
concurring.

															     Advancing price impact
consideration from the merits stage to the certification stage may
broaden the scope of discovery available at certification. See Tr.
of Oral Arg. 36–37. But the Court recognizes that it is
incumbent upon the defendant to show the absence of price impact.
See ante, at 17–18. The Court’s judgment, therefore,
should impose no heavy toll on securities-fraud plaintiffs with
tenable claims. On that understanding, I join the Court’s
opinion.
