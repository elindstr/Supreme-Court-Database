															AIR WISCONSIN AIRLINES CORPORATION,PETITIONER v. WILLIAM L.
HOEPER

															ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF COLORADO

															[January 27, 2014]

															Â Â Â Â  Justice
Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court.

															Â Â Â Â  In 2001,
Congress created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)
to assess and manage threats against air travel. Aviation and
Transportation Security Act (ATSA),49
U.Â S.Â C. Â§44901
etÂ seq. To ensure that theTSA would be informed of
potential threats, Congress gave airlines and their employees
immunity against civil liability for reporting suspicious behavior.
Â§44941(a). But this immunity does not attach to
â€œany disclosure made with actual knowledge that
the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or misleadingâ€ or
â€œany disclosure made with reckless disregard as
to the truth or falsity of that disclosure.â€
Â§44941(b).

															Â Â Â Â  The
question before us is whether ATSA immunity may be denied under
Â§44941(b) without a determination that a disclosure was
materially false. We hold that it may not. Because the state courts
made no such determination, and because any falsehood in the
disclosure here would not have affected a reasonable security
officerâ€™s assessment of the supposed threat, we
reverse the judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court.

															I

															A

															Â Â Â Â  William
Hoeper joined Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation as a pilot in
1998. But by late 2004, Air Wisconsin had stopped operating flights
from Denver, Hoeperâ€™s home base, on any type of
aircraft for which he was certified. To continue flying for Air
Wisconsin out of Denver, Hoeper needed to gain certification on the
British Aerospace 146 (BAe-146), an aircraft he had not flown.

															Â Â Â Â  Hoeper
failed in his first three attempts to pass a proficiency test.
After the third failure, as he later acknowledged at trial, his
employment was â€œat [Air
Wisconsinâ€™s] discretion.â€ App. 193.
But he and Air Wisconsin entered into an agreement to afford him
â€œone more opportunity to pass [the] proficiency
check.â€ Id., at 426. The agreement left little doubt
that Hoeper would lose his job if he failed again.

															Â Â Â Â  In December
2004, Hoeper flew from Denver to Virginia for simulator training as
part of this final test. During the training, Hoeper failed to cope
with a challenging scenario created by the instructor, Mark
Schuerman, and the simulator showed the engines
â€œflam[ing] outâ€ due to a loss of
fuel. App. 203. As Schuerman began to tell Hoeper that he
â€œshould know better,â€ ibid., Hoeper
responded angrily. He later described what happened:

															â€œAt this point, thatâ€™s it.
I take my headset off and I toss it up on the glare shield.
.Â .Â . [Schuerman] and I exchanged words at
the same elevated decibel level. Mine went something like this:
This is a bunch of shit. Iâ€™m sorry. You are
railroading the situation and itâ€™s not
realistic.â€ Id., at 203â€“204.

															When Hoeper announced that he wanted to call the legal
department of the pilotsâ€™ union, Schuerman ended
the session so that Hoeper could do so. Schuerman then re-ported
Hoeperâ€™s behavior to Patrick Doyle, the
Wisconsin-based manager of the BAe-146 fleet. Doyle booked Hoeper
on a United Airlines flight back to Denver.

															Â Â Â Â  Several
hours after Schuermanâ€™s report, Doyle discussed
the situation at Air Wisconsinâ€™s headquarters
with the airlineâ€™s Vice President of Operations,
Kevin LaWare; its Managing Director of Flight Operations, Scott
Orozco; and its Assistant Chief Pilot, Robert Frisch. LaWare later
ex-plained the accretion of his concerns about what Hoeper might do
next. He regarded Hoeperâ€™s behavior in the
simulator as â€œa fairly significant
outburst,â€ of a sort that he
â€œhadnâ€™t seen
.Â .Â . before.â€ Id., at 276. And
he knew â€œit was a given that
.Â .Â . Hoeperâ€™s
employment was .Â .Â . going to be
terminatedâ€ as a result of his failure to complete the
simulator training. Id., at 278.

															Â Â Â Â  Then,
LaWare testified, Orozco mentioned that Hoeper was a Federal Flight
Deck Officer (FFDO). The FFDO program allows the Government to
â€œdeputize volunteer pilots of air carriers
.Â .Â . to defend the flight decks of
aircraft .Â .Â . against acts of criminal
violence or air piracy.â€ Â§44921(a). FFDOs
are permitted â€œto carry a firearm while engaged
in providing air transportation.â€
Â§44921(fÂ )(1). Hoeper had become an FFDO
earlier in 2004 and had been issued a firearm. He was not allowed
to carry the firearm during his trip to the training facility,
because he was not â€œengaged in providing air
transportation,â€ ibid. But according to one official at
the meeting, the Denver airportâ€™s security
procedures made it possible for crew members to bypass screening,
so that Hoeper could have carried his gun despite the rule. Indeed,
Frisch later testified that he was â€œaware of
oneâ€ incident in which an Air Wisconsin pilot had come
to training with his FFDO weapon. App. 292. On the basis of this
information, LaWare concluded, there was â€œno way
.Â .Â . to confirmâ€ whether
â€œHoeper had his weapon with him, even though
.Â .Â . by policy, [he was] not supposed to
have it with him.â€ Id., at 279.

															Â Â Â Â  Finally,
LaWare testified, he and the other Air Wisconsin officials
discussed two prior episodes in which disgruntled airline employees
had lashed out violently. Id., at 280. In one incident, a FedEx
flight engineer under investigation for misconduct
â€œentered the cockpitâ€ of a FedEx
flight â€œand began attacking the crew with a
hammerâ€ before being subdued. United States v.
Calloway, 116 F.Â 3d 1129, 1131 (CA6 1997). In another,
a recently fired ticket agent brought a gun onto a Pacific
Southwest Airlines flight and shot his former supervisor and the
crew, leading to a fatal crash. Malnic, Report Confirms That Gunman
Caused 1987 Crash of PSA Jet, L.Â A. Times,Jan. 6, 1989,
p.Â 29.

															Â Â Â Â  In light of
all thisâ€”Hoeperâ€™s anger, his
impending termination, the chance that he might be armed, and the
history of assaults by disgruntled airline
employeesâ€”LaWare decided that the airline
â€œneed[ed] to make a call to the
TSA,â€ to let the authorities know
â€œthe statusâ€ of the situation. App.
282.

															Â Â Â Â  Doyle
offered to make the call. According to the jury, he made two
statements to the TSA: first, that Hoeper â€œwas
an FFDO who may be armedâ€ and that the airline was
â€œconcerned about his mental stability and the
whereabouts of his firearmâ€; and second, that an
â€œ[u]nstable pilot in [the] FFDO program was
terminated today.â€ App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a. (The
latter statement appears in the record as the subject line of an
internal TSA e-mail, summarizing the call from Doyle. App.
414.)

															Â Â Â Â  The TSA
responded to the call by ordering that Hoeperâ€™s
plane return to the gate. Officers boarded the plane, re-moved
Hoeper, searched him, and questioned him about the location of his
gun. When Hoeper stated that the gun was at his home in Denver, a
Denver-based federal agent went there to retrieve it.

															Â Â Â Â  Later that
day, Hoeper boarded a return flight to Denver. Air Wisconsin fired
him the following day.

															B

															Â Â Â Â  Hoeper sued
Air Wisconsin in Colorado state court on several claims, including
defamation.[1] Air Wisconsin moved for summary
judgment on the basis of ATSA immunity,[2] but
the trial court denied it, ruling that the jury was entitled to
find the facts pertinent to immunity. The case went to trial, and
the court denied Air Wisconsinâ€™s motion for a
directed verdict on the same basis. It submitted the question of
ATSA immunity to the jury, with the
instructionâ€”following the language of
Â§44941(b)â€”that immunity would not
apply if Hoeper had proved thatAir Wisconsin
â€œmade the disclosure [to the TSA] with ac-tual
knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate, or
misleadingâ€ or â€œwith reckless
disregard as to its truth or falsity.â€ App. 582. The
jury instructions did not state that ATSA immunity protects
materially true statements.

															Â Â Â Â  The jury
found for Hoeper on the defamation claim and awarded him $849,625
in compensatory damages and $391,875 in punitive damages. The court
reduced the latter award to $350,000, for a total judgment of just
under $1.2 million, plus costs.

															Â Â Â Â  The
Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed. 232 P.Â 3d 230
(2009). It held â€œthat the trial court properly
submitted the ATSA immunity issue to the jury,â€ that
â€œthe record supports the
juryâ€™s rejection of immunity,â€ and
that the evidence was sufficient to support the
juryâ€™s defamation verdict. Id., at 233.

															Â Â Â Â  The
Colorado Supreme Court affirmed. 2012 WL 907764 (Mar. 19, 2012). It
began by holding, contrary to the lower courts,
â€œthat immunity under the ATSA is a question of
law to be determined by the trial court before trial.â€
Id., at *4. But it concluded that the trial
courtâ€™s error in submitting immunity to the jury
was â€œharmless because Air Wisconsin is not
entitled to immunity.â€ Id., at *6. In a key footnote,
the court stated: â€œIn our determination of
immunity under the ATSA, we need not, and therefore do not, decide
whether the statements were true or false. Rather, we conclude that
Air Wisconsin made the statements with reckless disregard as to
their truth or falsity.â€ Id., at *16, n. 6. The court
thus appears tohave labored under the assumption that even true
statements do not qualify for ATSA immunity if they are made
recklessly.

															Â Â Â Â  Applying
this standard, and giving â€œno weight to the
juryâ€™s finding[s],â€ ibid.,
n.Â 5, the court held that
â€œ[a]l-though the events at the training may have
warranteda report to TSA,â€ Air
Wisconsinâ€™s statements
â€œoverstated those events to such a degree that
they were made with reckless disregard of their truth or
falsity.â€ Id., at *7. The court opined that Air
Wisconsin â€œwould likely be immune under the ATSA
if Doyle had reported that Hoeper was an Air Wisconsin employee,
that he knew he would be terminated soon, that he had acted
irrationally at the training three hours earlier and
â€˜blew upâ€™ at test
administrators, and that he was an FFDO pilot.â€ Id., at
*8. But because Doyle actually told TSA â€œ(1)
that he believed Hoeper to be mentally unstable; (2) that Hoeper
had been terminated earlier that day; and (3) that Hoeper may have
been armed,â€ id., at *7, the court determined that his
statements â€œwent well beyondâ€ the
facts and did not qualify for immunity, id., at *8. The court went
on to conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the
juryâ€™s defamation verdict.

															Â Â Â Â  Justice
Eid, joined by two others, dissented in part. She agreed with the
majorityâ€™s holding that immunity is an issue for
the court, not the jury. But she reasoned that Air Wisconsin was
entitled to immunity â€œbecause [its] statements
to the TSA were substantially true.â€ Id., at *11.

															Â Â Â Â  We granted
certiorari to decide â€œ[w]hether ATSA immunity
may be denied without a determination that the air
carrierâ€™s disclosure was materially
false.â€ 570 U.Â S. ___ (2013).

															II

															A

															Â Â Â Â  Congress
patterned the exception to ATSA immunity after the actual malice
standard of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,376 U.Â S.
254 (1964), and we have long held that actual malice requires
material falsity. Because we presume that Congress meant to
incorporate the settled meaning of actual malice when it
incorporated the language of that standard, we hold that a
statement otherwise eligible for ATSA immunity may not be
deniedimmunity unless the statement is materially false.

															Â Â Â Â  In New York
Times, we held that under the First Amendment, a public official
cannot recover â€œfor a defamatory falsehood
relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the
statement was made with â€˜actual
maliceâ€™â€”that is, with
knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether
it was false or not.â€ Id., at
279â€“280. Congress borrowed this exact language
in denying ATSA immunity to â€œ(1) any disclosure
made with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false,
inaccurate, or misleading; or (2) any disclosure made with
recklessdisregard as to the truth or falsity of that
disclosure.â€ Â§44941(b).

															Â Â Â Â  One could
in principle construe the language of the actual malice standard to
cover true statements made recklessly. But we have long held, to
the contrary, that actual malice entails falsity. See, e.g.,
Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps,475 U.Â S.
767,775 (1986) (â€œ[A]s one might expect given the
language of the Court in New York Times, a public-figure plaintiff
must show the falsity of the statements at issue in order to
prevail in a suit for defamationâ€ (citation omitted));
Garrison v. Louisiana,379 U.Â S. 64,74 (1964)
(â€œWe held in New York Times that a public
official might be allowed the civil remedy only if he establishes
that the utterance was falseâ€).

															Â Â Â Â  Indeed, we
have required more than mere falsity to establish actual malice:
The falsity must be â€œmaterial.â€
Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc.,501 U. S. 496,517 (1991). As we
explained in Masson, â€œ[m]inor inaccuracies do
not amount to falsity so long as â€˜the substance,
the gist, the sting, of the libelous charge be
justified.â€™Â â€ Ibid. A
â€œstatement is not considered false unless it
â€˜would have a different effect on the mind of
the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have
produced.â€™Â â€ Ibid.
(quoting R. Sack, Libel, Slander, and Related Problems 138
(1980)).

															Â Â Â Â  These
holdings were settled when Congress enacted the ATSA, and we
therefore presume that Congress meant to adopt the material falsity
requirement when it incorporated the actual malice standard into
the ATSA immunity exception. â€œ[I]t is a cardinal
rule of statutory construction that, when Congress employs a term
of art, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that
were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from
which it is taken.â€ FAA v. Cooper, 566
U.Â S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 6) (internal
quotation marks omitted). The actual malice standard does not cover
materially true statements made recklessly, so we presume that
Congress did not mean to deny ATSA immunity to such statements.

															Â Â Â Â  Other
indicia of statutory meaning could rebut this presumption, but
here, they do not. First, the ATSAâ€™stext favors
a falsity requirement. The first subsection of
Â§44941(b) requires falsity, as a true disclosure cannot
have been made â€œwith actual
knowledgeâ€ that it â€œwas
false.â€ The only question is whether the second
subsectionâ€”which denies immunity to
â€œany disclosure made with reckless disregard as
to [its] truth or falsityâ€â€”similarly
requires falsity. We conclude that it does. The second subsection
simply extends the immunity exception from knowing falsehoods to
reckless ones, ensuring that an air carrier cannot avoid liability
for a baseless report by sticking its head in the sand to avoid
â€œactual knowledgeâ€ that its
statements are false. â€œ[T]he defense of truth
.Â .Â . , even if not explicitly recognized,
.Â .Â .is implicit in
.Â .Â . a standard of recovery that rests on
knowing or reckless disregard of the truth.â€ Cox
Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn,420 U. S. 469â€“499
(1975) (Powell, J., concurring).

															Â Â Â Â  A material
falsity requirement also serves the purpose of ATSA immunity. The
ATSA shifted from airlines to the TSA the responsibility
â€œfor assessing and investigating possible
threats to airline security.â€ 2012 WL 907764, *14 (Eid,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In directing the
TSA to â€œreceive, assess, and distribute
intelligence information related to transportation
security,â€49 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§114(f)(1), Congress wanted to ensure that air carriers
and their employees would not hesitate to provide the TSA with the
information it needed. This is the purpose of the immunity
provision, evident both from its context and from the title of the
statutory section that contained it:
â€œencouraging airline employees to report
sus-picious activities.â€ ATSA
Â§125,115Stat.631 (capitali-zation and boldface type
omitted). It would defeat this purpose to deny immunity for
substantially true reports, on the theory that the person making
the report had not yet gathered enough information to be certain of
its truth. Such a rule would restore the pre-ATSA state of affairs,
in which air carriers bore the responsibility to investigate and
verify potential threats.

															Â Â Â Â  We
therefore hold that ATSA immunity may not be denied under
Â§44941(b) to materially true statements. This
interpretation of the statute is clear enough that Hoeper
effectively concedes it. See Brief for Respondent 30 (acknowledging
that if the Colorado Supreme Court actually said
â€œÂ â€˜an airline may
be denied ATSA immunity .Â .Â . for reporting
true information,â€™Â â€
then â€œthe court was likely wrongâ€).
Hoeper does point out in a footnote that given
Congressâ€™ desire to deny immunity to
â€œÂ â€˜bad
actors,â€™Â â€ and
â€œgiven that the vast majority of reckless
statements will not turn out to be true[,] . . . Congress could
have quite reasonably chosen to deny the special privilege of ATSA
immunity to all reckless speakers,â€ even those whose
statements turned out to be true. Id., at 30, n.Â 12.
But although Congress could have made this choice, nothing about
the statuteâ€™s text or purpose suggests that it
actually did. Instead, Congress chose to model the exception to
ATSA immunity after a standard we have long construed to require
material falsity.

															B

															Â Â Â Â  We are not
persuaded by Hoeperâ€™s arguments thatwe should
affirm the judgment of the Colorado Supreme Court notwithstanding
its misapprehension of the ATSA immunity standard.

															Â Â Â Â  Hoeper
first argues that Air Wisconsin forfeited the claim that it is
entitled to immunity because its statements were materially true.
His premise is that AirWisconsin argued the truth of its statements
only in challenging the evidentiary basis for the defamation
verdict, not in asserting immunity. But Air
Wisconsinâ€™s brief before the Colorado Supreme
Court argued that the exception to ATSA immunity
â€œappears to incorporate the New York Times
actual malice standard,â€ whichâ€”as we
have explainedâ€”requires material falsity.
Petitionerâ€™s Opening Brief in No. 09SC1050, p.
24.

															Â Â Â Â  Hoeper next
argues that the Colorado Supreme Court performed the requisite
analysis of material falsity, albeit in the context of finding the
record sufficient to support the juryâ€™s
defamation verdict. For several reasons, however, this analysis
does not suffice for us to affirm the denialof ATSA immunity.
First, to the extent that the immunity determination belongs to the
courtâ€”as the Colorado Supreme Court
heldâ€”a courtâ€™s deferential
review of jury findings cannot substitute for its own analysis of
the record. Second, the jury here did not find that any falsity in
Air Wisconsinâ€™s statements was material, because
the trial court instructed it only to determine whether
â€œ[o]ne or more of th[e] statements was
false,â€ App. 580, without addressing materiality.
Third, applying the material falsity standard to a defamation claim
is quite different from applying it to ATSA immunity. In both
contexts,a materially false statement is one that
â€œÂ â€˜would have a
different effect on the mind of the reader [or listener] from that
which the .Â .Â . truth would have
produced.â€™Â â€ Masson, 501
U.Â S., at 517. But the identity of the relevant reader
or listener varies according to the context. In determining whether
a falsehood is material to a defamation claim, we care whether it
affects the subjectâ€™s reputation in the
community. In the context of determining ATSA immu-nity, by
contrast, we care whether a falsehood affects the
authoritiesâ€™ perception of and response to a
given threat.[3]

															III

															Â Â Â Â  Finally,
the Colorado Supreme Courtâ€™s analysis of
material falsity was erroneous. We turn next to explaining why, by
applying the ATSA immunity standard to the facts of this
case.[4]

															A

															Â Â Â Â  We begin by
addressing how to determine the material-ity of a false statement
in the ATSA context. As we noted earlier, a materially false
statement is generally one that
â€œÂ â€˜would have a
different effect on the mind of the reader [or listener] from that
which the .Â .Â . truth would have
produced.â€™Â â€ Ibid. The
parties quibble over whether ATSA immunity requires some special
version of this standard, but they more or less
agreeâ€”as do weâ€”that the usual
standard suffices as long as the hypothetical reader or listener is
a security officer.

															Â Â Â Â  A further
question is what it means for a statement to produce
â€œÂ â€˜a different
effect on the mind ofâ€™Â â€
a security officer from that which the truth would have produced.
In defamation law, the reputational harm caused by a false
statement is its effect on a readerâ€™s or
listenerâ€™s mind. But contrary to the position of
Hoeperâ€™s counsel at oral argument, Tr. of Oral
Arg. 32â€“33, courts cannot decide whether a false
statement produced
â€œÂ â€˜a different
effect on the mind ofâ€™Â â€
a hypothetical TSA officer without considering the effect of that
statement on TSAâ€™s behavior. After all, the
whole reason the TSA considers threat reports is to deter-mine and
execute a response.

															Â Â Â Â  A plaintiff
seeking to defeat ATSA immunity need not show
â€œprecisely what a particular official or federal
agency would have done in a counterfactual scenario.â€
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27. Such a showing would
be â€œimpossible .Â .Â .
given the need to maintain se-crecy regarding airline security
operations.â€ Brief for Re-spondent 42. But any
falsehood cannot be material, for purposes of ATSA immunity, absent
a substantial likelihood that a reasonable security officer would
consider it important in determining a response to the supposed
threat. Cf. TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.,426
U.Â S. 438,449 (1976) (an omission in a proxy
solicitation â€œis material if there is a
substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider
it important in deciding how to voteâ€). This standard
â€œis an objectiveone, involving the
[hypothetical] significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to
a reasonableâ€ security official, rather than the actual
significance of that fact to a particular security official. Id.,
at 445.

															B

															Â Â Â Â  We apply
the material falsity standard to the facts of this case. In doing
so, we neither embrace nor reject the Colorado Supreme
Courtâ€™s unanimous holding
â€œthat immunity under the ATSA is a question of
law to be determined by the trial court before trial.â€
2012 WL 9097764, *4; see id., at *11 (Eid, J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part) (agreeing with majority). Rather, we
conclude that even if a jury were to find the historical facts in
the manner most favorable to Hoeper, Air Wisconsin is entitled to
ATSA immunity as a matter of law.

															Â Â Â Â  We begin
with Air Wisconsinâ€™s statement that Hoeper
â€œwas an FFDO who may be armed.â€ App.
to Pet. for Cert. 111a. Hoeper cannot dispute the literal truth of
this statement: He was an FFDO, and because FFDOs possess weapons,
any FFDO â€œmay be armed.â€ Hoeper
argues only that to avoid any misinterpretation, Air Wisconsin
should have qualified the statement by adding that it had no reason
to think he was actually carrying his gun during the trip to
Virginia, especially because he was not allowed to do so under
Â§44921(fÂ )(1).[5] We
agree that Air Wisconsinâ€™s statement could have
been misinterpreted by some, but we reject
Hoeperâ€™s argument for two reasons. First, any
confusion of the nature that Hoeper suggests would have been
immaterial: A reasonable TSA officer, having been told only that
Hoeper was an FFDO and that he was upset about losing his job,
would have wanted to investigate whether Hoeper was carrying his
gun. Second, to accept Hoeperâ€™s demand for such
precise wording would vitiate the purpose of ATSA immunity: to
encourage air carriers and their employees, often in fast-moving
situations and with little time to fine-tune their diction, to
provide the TSA immediately with information about potential
threats. Baggage handlers, flight attendants, gate agents, and
other airline employees who report suspicious behavior to the TSA
should not face financial ruin if, in the heat of a potential
threat, they fail to choose their words with exacting
care.[6]

															Â Â Â Â  We next
consider Air Wisconsinâ€™s statement that Hoeper
â€œwas terminated today.â€ App. to Pet.
for Cert. 111a. When Air Wisconsin made that statement, Hoeper had
not yet been fired. But everyone knew the firing was almost
certainly imminent. Hoeper acknowledged that his employment was
â€œat [Air Wisconsinâ€™s]
discretionâ€ after his third failed test, App. 193, and
the agreement between him and Air Wisconsin stated that his
â€œfourth .Â .Â .
attemptâ€ to pass the test would be his
â€œfinalâ€ one, id., at 426. No
reasonable TSA officer would care whether an angry, po-tentially
armed airline employee had just been fired or merely knew he was
about to meet that fate.

															Â Â Â Â  Finally, we
consider Air Wisconsinâ€™s statements that Hoeper
was â€œ[u]nstableâ€ and that it was
â€œconcerned about his mental
stability.â€ App. to Pet. for Cert. 111a. Al-though the
details of Hoeperâ€™s behavior during the
simulator session may be disputed, Hoeper himself testified that he
had become visibly angry: He decided
â€œthatâ€™s it,â€ he
removed his headset and â€œtoss[ed]
it,â€ and he accused the
instructorâ€”at an â€œelevated
decibel level,â€ and with an
expletiveâ€”of â€œrailroading the
situation.â€ App. 203â€“204. It would
surely have been correct, then, for Air Wisconsin to report that
Hoeper â€œÂ â€˜blew
upâ€™Â â€ during the test.
2012 WL 907764, *8. The question is whether, from the perspective
of a reasonable security officer, there is any material difference
between a statement that Hoeper had just â€œblown
upâ€ in a professional setting and a statement that
hewas â€œ[u]nstable.â€ We think
not.

															Â Â Â Â  We are no
more troubled by Air Wisconsinâ€™s related
statement that it was â€œconcerned about
[Hoeperâ€™s] mental stability.â€ Hoeper
is correct that many of the Air Wisconsin officials who attended
the meeting at headquarters might not have framed their concerns in
terms of â€œmen-tal stability.â€
LaWare, for instance, testified that â€œ[t]hose
werenâ€™t the words that [he] would have
anticipatedâ€ when he directed Doyle to call the TSA.
App. 272. But the officials who attended the meeting did harbor
concerns about Hoeperâ€™s mental state: They knew
he had just â€œblown up,â€ and they
worried about what he might do next. It would be inconsistent with
the ATSAâ€™s text and purpose to expose Air
Wisconsin to liability because its employee could have chosen a
slightly better phrase than â€œmental
stabilityâ€ to articulate its concern. Just as
â€œ[m]inor inaccuracies do not amount to
falsityâ€ in the defamation context,
â€œso long as â€˜the substance,
the gist, the sting, of the libelous charge be
justified,â€™Â â€ Masson,
501 U.Â S., at 517, a statement that would otherwise
qualify for ATSA immunity cannot lose that immunity because of some
minor imprecision, so long as â€œthe
gistâ€ of the statement is accurate.
Doyleâ€™s statements to the TSA accu-rately
conveyed â€œthe gistâ€ of the
situation; it is irrelevant whether trained lawyers or judges might
with the luxury of time have chosen more precise words.

															Â Â Â Â 
Hoeperâ€™s overarching factual theory appears to
be that members of the BAe-146 team, including Doyle and
Schuer-man, harbored personal animosity toward him, which caused
them to manipulate the proficiency tests in order to fail him. But
even if Hoeper were correct aboutall this (and we express no view
on that question), we do not see why it would have made him any
less a threat in the eyes of a reasonable security officer. As
between two employeesâ€”one who thinks he is being
fired because of his inadequate skills, another who thinks he is
being fired because his employer hates himâ€”the
latter is presumably more, not less, likely to lash out in
anger.

															Â Â Â Â  The partial
dissent argues that Doyleâ€™s reference to
Hoeperâ€™s â€œmental
stabilityâ€ was so egregious as to make his report to
the TSA the basis of a $1.2 million defamation judgment. We
disagree. While lawyers and judges may in some contexts apply the
label â€œmentally unstableâ€ to people
suffering from serious mental illnesses, see post, at 4 (Scalia,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), that is hardly the
only manner in which the label is used. A holding that Air
Wisconsin lost its ATSA immunity by virtue of
Doyleâ€™s failure to be aware of every connotation
of the phrase â€œmental stabilityâ€
would eviscerate the immunity provision. All of us from time to
time use words that, on reflection, we might modify. If such slips
of the tongue could give rise to major financial liability, no
airline would contact the TSA (or permit its employees to do so)
without running by its lawyers the text of its proposed
disclosureâ€”exactly the kind of hesitation that
Congress aimed to avoid.

															Â Â Â Â  The partial
dissent further argues that Hoeperâ€™s
â€œdisplay of angerâ€ made him no more
a threat than â€œmillions of perfectly harmless
air travelers.â€ Post, at 4. But Hoeper did not just
lose his temper; he lost it in circumstances that he knew would
lead to his firing, which he regarded as the culmination of a
vendetta against him. And he was not just any passenger; he was an
FFDO, which meant that he could plausibly have been carrying a
firearm. In short, Hoeper was not some traveling businessman who
yelled at a barista in a fit of pique over a badly brewed cup of
coffee.

															Â Â Â Â  Finally,
the partial dissent relies on an expertâ€™s
testimony â€œthat Hoeperâ€™s
behavior did not warrant any report to the TSA.â€ Post,
at 4 (citing App. 356). But the expert appears to have based that
statement on an outdated understanding of reporting obligations
that is flatly at odds with the ATSA. Prior to the ATSA,
â€œairlines were responsible for assessing and
investigating possible threats to airline security.â€
2012 WL 907764, *14 (Eid, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part). But the ATSA shifted that responsibility to the TSA,
creating a policy â€œknown as
â€˜when in doubt, report.â€™
â€ Ibid.; see supra, at 9. The expert who believed that
Hoeperâ€™s conduct did not warrant a report to the
TSA also believed that airlines have â€œan
obligation .Â .Â . to filter out
.Â .Â . the low noise from
.Â .Â . whatâ€™s
significantâ€ in reporting threats. App. 356. That
understanding does not comport with the policy that Congress chose
to enact.

															Â Â Â Â  The
Colorado Supreme Court recognized that even if the facts are viewed
in the light most favorable to Hoeper, Air Wisconsin
â€œwould likely be immuneâ€ had it
â€œreported that Hoeper
.Â .Â . knew he would be terminated soon,
that he had acted irrationally at the training three hours earlier
and â€˜blew upâ€™ at test
administrators, and that he was an FFDO pilot.â€ 2012 WL
907764, *8. But the court erred in parsing so finely the
distinctions between these hypothetical statements and the ones
that Air Wisconsin actually made. The minor differences are, for
the reasons we have explained, immaterial as a matter of law in
determining Air Wisconsinâ€™s ATSA immunity.

															Â Â Â Â  By
incorporating the actual malice standard into
Â§44941(b), Congress meant to give air carriers the
â€œÂ â€˜breathing
spaceâ€™Â â€ to report
potential threats to security officials without fear of civil
liability for a few inaptly chosen words. New York Times, 376
U.Â S., at 272. To hold Air Wisconsin liable for minor
misstatements or loose wording would undermine that purpose and
disregard the statutory text.

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															Â Â Â Â  The
judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado is therefore reversed,
and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1Â Air Wisconsin agrees that it
bears responsibility for Doyleâ€™s statements.
2012 WL 907764, *2, *16, n.Â 2 (Colo., Mar. 19,
2012).
2Â The ATSA immunity provision
specifies that â€œ[a]ny air carrier
.Â .Â . or any employee of an air carrier
.Â .Â . who makes a voluntary disclosureof
any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law
or regulation, relating to air piracy, a threat to aircraft or
passenger safety, or terrorism, .Â .Â . to
any employee or agent of the Department of Transportation, the
Department of Justice, any Federal, State, or local law enforcement
officer, or any airport or airline security officer shall not be
civilly liable to any person under any law or regulation of the
United States, any constitution, law, or regulation of any State or
political subdivision of any State, for such
disclosure.â€.
3Â These are very different
inquiries. Suppose the TSA receives the following tip:
â€œMy adulterous husband is carrying a gun onto a
flight.â€ Whether the husband is adulterous will
presumably have no effect on the TSAâ€™s
assessment of any security risk that he poses. So if the word
â€œadulterousâ€ is false, the caller
may still be entitled to ATSA immunity. But any falsity as to that
word obviously would affect the husbandâ€™s
reputation in the community, so it would be material in the context
of a defamation claim.
4Â We
â€œrecognize the prudence
.Â .Â . of allowing the lower courts
â€˜to undertake [a fact-intensive inquiry] in the
first instance.â€™Â â€ v. ,.
Here, however, we conclude that another prudential
considerationâ€”the need for clear guidance on a
novel but important question of federal
lawâ€”weighs in favor of our applying the ATSA
immunity standard. Cf. v. ,
(â€œ[TÂ ]his Courtâ€™s
role in marking out the limits of [a ] standard through the process
of case-by-case adjudication is of special
importanceâ€).
5Â See Tr. of Oral Arg.
42â€“43 (concession by Hoeperâ€™s
counsel that â€œit would have been true for [Air
Wisconsin] to say, look, weâ€™re calling to let
you know, because Mr. Hoeperâ€™s an FFDO, we
donâ€™t have any reason to believe that he has gun
with him, but we canâ€™t tell for sure, so we just
thought we would tell you, in case you have any questions and want
to investigate furtherâ€).
6Â Hoeper also takes issue with
Air Wisconsinâ€™s statement that it was
â€œconcerned about .Â .Â .
the whereabouts of his firearm,â€ App. to Pet. for Cert.
111a. But his arguments concerning this statement are the same as
those concerning the statement that he â€œmay
[have] been armed,â€ ,and we reject them for the same
reasons.
