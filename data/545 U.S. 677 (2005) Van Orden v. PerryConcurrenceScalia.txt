SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-1500

															THOMAS VAN ORDEN, PETITIONER v. RICK
PERRY, in his official capacity as GOVERNOR OF TEXAS and CHAIRMAN,
STATE PRESERVATION BOARD, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 27, 2005]

															   Justice Scalia, concurring.

															   I join the opinion of The Chief
Justice because I think it accurately reflects our current
Establishment Clause jurisprudence—or at least the
Establishment Clause jurisprudence we currently apply some of the
time. I would prefer to reach the same result by adopting an
Establishment Clause jurisprudence that is in accord with our
Nation’s past and present practices, and that can be
consistently applied—the central relevant feature of which is
that there is nothing unconstitutional in a State’s favoring
religion generally, honoring God through public prayer and
acknowledgment, or, in a nonproselytizing manner, venerating the
Ten Commandments. See McCreary County v. American
Civil Liberties Union of Ky., post, at 1–11
(Scalia, J., dissenting).
