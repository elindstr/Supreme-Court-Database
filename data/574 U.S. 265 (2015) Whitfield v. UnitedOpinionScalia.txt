															LARRY WHITFIELD, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the fourth circuit

															[January 13, 2015]

															Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

															Federal law establishes enhanced penalties for anyone who
â€œforces any person to accompany himâ€
in the course of committing or fleeing from a bank robbery.18
U.Â S.Â C. Â§2113(e). We consider
whether this provision applies when a bank robber forces someone to
move with him over a short distance.

															I

															Petitioner Larry Whitfield, fleeing police after a botched bank
robbery, entered the home of 79-year-old Mary Parnell through an
unlocked door. Once inside, he encountered a terrified Parnell and
guided her from the hallway to a computer room (which Whitfield
estimates was between four and nine feet away. Brief for Petitioner
5). There, Parnell suffered a fatal heart attack. Whitfield fled,
and was found hiding nearby.

															A grand jury indicted Whitfield for, among other things,
violating Â§2113(e) by forcing Parnell to accompany him
in the course of avoiding apprehension for a bank robbery. That
section provides:

															â€œWhoever, in committing any offense defined
in this section, or in avoiding or attempting to avoid apprehension
for the commission of such offense .Â .Â .
forces any person to accompany him without the consent of such
person, shall be imprisoned not less than ten years, or if
death results shall be punished by death or life
imprisonment.â€ (Emphasis added.)

															Whitfield pleaded not guilty to the offense but a jury convicted
him.

															On appeal, Whitfield challenged the sufficiency of the evidence,
arguing that Â§2113(e) requires
â€œsubstantialâ€ movement, and that his
movement with Parnell did not qualify. Brief for Appellant in No.
10â€“5217 (CA4),pp. 50â€“52. The
Fourth Circuit disagreed, holding that,
â€œ[a]lthough Whitfield required Mrs. Parnell to
accompany him for only a short distance within her own home, and
for a brief period, no more is required to prove that a forced
accompaniment occurred.â€ 695 F.Â 3d 288, 311
(2012). After further proceedings in the District Court and Court
of Appeals, 548 Fed. Appx. 70 (2013), we granted certiorari, 573
U.Â S. ___ (2014).

															II

															Congress enacted the forced-accompaniment provision in 1934
after â€œan outbreak of bank robberies committed
by John Dillinger and others.â€ Carter v.
United States,530 U.Â S. 255,280 (2000)
(Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Section 2113 has been amended
frequently, but the relevant
phraseâ€”â€œforces any person to
accompany him without the consent of such
personâ€â€”has remained unchanged, and
so presumptively retains its original meaning. Vermont Agency of
Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens,529
U.Â S. 765,783, n.12 (2000).

															In 1934, just as today, to
â€œaccompanyâ€ someone meant to
â€œgo withâ€ him. See Oxford English
Dictionary 60 (1st ed. 1933) (defining
â€œaccompanyâ€ as:
â€œTo go in company with, to go along
withâ€). The word does not, as Whitfield contends,
connote movement over a substantial distance. It was, and still is,
perfectly natural to speak of accompanying someone over a
relatively short distance, for example: from one area within a bank
â€œto the vaultâ€;[1]
â€œto the altarâ€ at a
wedding;[2] â€œup the
stairwayâ€;[3] or into, out of, or
across a room.[4] English literature is replete
with examples. See, e.g., C. Dickens, David Copperfield 529
(Modern Library ed. 2000) (Uriah â€œaccompanied me
into Mr. Wickfieldâ€™s roomâ€); J.
Austen, Pride and Prejudice 182 (Greenwich ed. 1982) (Elizabeth
â€œaccompanied her out of the
roomâ€).

															It is true enough that accompaniment does not embrace minimal
movementâ€”for example, the movement of a bank
tellerâ€™s feet when the robber grabs her arm. It
must constitute movement that would normally be described as from
one place to another, even if only from one spot withina room or
outdoors to a different one. Here, Whitfield forced Parnell to
accompany him for at least several feet, from one room to another.
That surely sufficed.

															In an attempt to support his position that
â€œaccompanyâ€ should be read to mean
â€œaccompany over a substantial
distance,â€ Whitfield observes that a
forced-accompaniment conviction carries severe penalties: a
mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, and a maximum sentence of
life imprisonment. In 1934, a forced-accompaniment conviction could
even be punished with death. Act of May 18, 1934, ch. 304,
Â§3,48Stat.783. The severity of these sentences,
Whitfield says, militates against interpreting subsection (e) to
capture forced accompaniment occurring over a small distance.

															But it does not seem to us that the danger of a forced
accompaniment varies with the distance traversed. Consider, for
example, a hostage-takerâ€™s movement of one of
his victims a short distance to a window, where she would be
exposed to police fire; or his use of the victim as a human shield
as he approaches the door. And even if we thought otherwise, we
would have no authority to add a limitation the statute plainly
does not contain. The Congress that wrote this provision may well
have had most prominently in mind John
Dillingerâ€™s driving off with hostages, but it
enacted a provision which goes wellbeyond that. It is simply not in
accord with English usage to give
â€œaccompanyâ€ a meaning that covers
only large distances.

															Whitfield also contends that
â€œaccompanyâ€ must be read narrowly in
light of Â§2113â€™s graduated penalty
scheme. That scheme prescribes: (1) a 20-year maximum sentence for
bank robbers who use â€œforce and
violenceâ€ or
â€œintimidation,â€
Â§2113(a), (2) a 25-year maximum sentence for those who
â€œassaul[t]â€ or
â€œpu[t] in jeopardy the life ofâ€
another â€œby the use of a dangerous weapon or
device,â€ Â§2113(d), and (3) a minimum
sentence of 10 years, and a maximum sentence of life, for forced
accompaniment, Â§2113(e). According to Whitfield, bank
robbers almost always â€œexert some control over
the movement of the bankâ€™s
employ-ees.â€ Brief for Petitioner 22. Therefore, he
says, unless â€œaccompanyâ€ is limited
to forced movement over sub-stantial distances, nearly all
Â§2113 violations will be punishable under subsection
(e), making subsections (a) and(d) pointless.

															We disagree. Even if Whitfield is right that bank robbers always
â€œexert some controlâ€ over others, it
does not follow that they always force others to accompany
them somewhereâ€”that is, to go somewhere
with them. As we have no reason to think that to be the
case, and because subsections (a), (d), and (e) all cover distinct
conduct, our interpretation of
â€œaccompanyâ€ does not make any part
of Â§2113 superfluous.

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															We hold that a bank robber â€œforces [a] person
to accompany him,â€ for purposes of
Â§2113(e), when he forces that person to go somewhere
with him, even if the movement occurs entirely within a single
building or over a short distance. Defined in this manner,
Whitfield forced Parnell to â€œaccompany
him.â€ Â§2113(e). The judgment of the Fourth
Circuit is affirmed.

															It is so ordered.
