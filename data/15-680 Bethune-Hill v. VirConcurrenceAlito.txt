															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															GOLDEN BETHUNE-HILL, et al., APPELLANTS v. VIRGINIA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, et al.

															on appeal from the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia

															[March 1, 2017]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I join the opinion of the Court insofar as it upholds the constitutionality of District 75.  Ante, at 13–16.  The districting plan at issue here was adopted prior to our decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S. ___ (2013), and therefore it is appropriate to apply the body of law in effect at that time.  What is more, appellants have never contested the District Court’s holding that compliance with §5 of the Voting Rights Act was a compelling government interest for covered jurisdictions before our decision in Shelby County.  See 141 F. Supp. 3d 505, 545–547 (ED Va. 2015).

															I concur in the judgment of the Court insofar as it vacates and remands the judgment below with respect to all the remaining districts.  Unlike the Court, however, I would hold that all these districts must satisfy strict scrutiny.  See post, at 1–2 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see also League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry,

548 U. S. 399,
517 (2006)
 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (“[W]hen a legislature intentionally creates a majority-minority district, race is necessarily its predominant motivation and strict scrutiny is therefore triggered”).
