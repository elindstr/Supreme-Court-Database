															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															EDWARD A. CANIGLIA, PETITIONER v.  ROBERT F. STROM, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit

															[May 17, 2021]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Breyer joins, concurring.

															Fifteen years ago, this Court unanimously recognized that “[t]he role of a peace officer includes preventing violence and restoring order, not simply rendering first aid to casualties.”  Brigham City v. Stuart,

547 U.S. 398, 406 (2006).  A warrant to enter a home is not required, we explained, when there is a “need to assist persons who are seriously injured or threatened with such injury.”  Id., at 403; see also Michigan v. Fisher,

558 U.S. 45, 49 (2009) (per curiam) (warrantless entry justified where “there was an objectively reasonable basis for believing that medical assistance was needed, or persons were in danger” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Nothing in today’s opinion is to the contrary, and I join it on that basis.
