															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															RAY WHITE, et al. v. DANIEL T. PAULY, as personal representative of the ESTATE OF SAMUEL PAULY, DECEASED et al.

															on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit

															No. 16–67. Decided January 9, 2017

															

															Justice Ginsburg, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion on the understanding that it does not foreclose the denial of summary judgment to Officers Truesdale and Mariscal.  See 814 F. 3d 1060, 1068, 1073, 1074 (CA10 2016) (Court of Appeals emphasized, repeatedly, that fact disputes exist on question whether Truesdale and Mariscal “adequately identified themselves” as police officers before shouting “Come out or we’re coming in” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Further, as to Officer White, the Court, as I comprehend its opinion, leaves open the propriety of denying summary judgment based on fact disputes over when Officer White arrived at the scene, what he may have witnessed, and whether he had adequate time to identify himself and order Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon before Officer White shot Pauly.  Compare id., at 1080, with ante, at 8.  See also Civ. No. 12–1311 (D NM, Feb. 5, 2014), pp. 7, and n. 5, 9, App. to Pet. for Cert. 75–76, and n. 5, 77 (suggesting that Officer White may have been on the scene when Officers Truesdale and Mariscal threatened to invade the Pauly home).
