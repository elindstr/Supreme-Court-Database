															JOHN ROBERTSON, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES
ex rel. WYKENNA WATSON

															on writ of certiorari to the district of columbia court of appeals

															[May 24, 2010]



															   Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kennedy joins, dissenting.

															
   The Chief Justice would hold that criminal prosecutions, including criminal contempt proceedings, must be brought on behalf of the government.  I join his opinion with the understanding that the narrow holding it proposes does not address civil contempt proceedings or consider more generally the legitimacy of existing regimes for the enforcement of restraining orders.
