															PER CURIAM.

															On January 14, 1946, the petitioner, a Negro, concededly qualified to receive the professional legal education offered by the State, applied for admission to the School of Law of the University of Oklahoma, the only institution for legal education supported and maintained by the taxpayers of the Oklahoma.  Petitioner's application for admission was denied solely because of her color.

															Petitioner then made application for a writ of mandamus in the District Court of Cleveland County, Oklahoma.  The writ of mandamus was refused, and the Supreme Court of the Oklahoma affirmed the judgment of the District Court.  180 P.2d 135.  We brought the case here for review.
