SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 04-698

															BRIAN SCHAFFER, a minor, by his parents and next
friends, JOCELYN and MARTIN SCHAFFER, et al., PETITIONERS
v. JERRY WEAST, SUPERINTEN- DENT, MONTGOMERY COUNTY PUBLIC
SCHOOLS, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the fourth circuit

															[November 14, 2005]

															   Justice Stevens, concurring.

															   It is common ground that no
single principle or rule solves all cases by setting forth a
general test for ascertaining the incidence of proof burdens when
both a statute and its legislative history are silent on the
question. See Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation
v. EPA, 540
U. S. 461, 494, n. 17 (2004); see also ante, at 7;
post, at 1–2 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).
Accordingly, I do not understand the majority to disagree with the
proposition that a court, taking into account
“ ‘policy considerations, convenience, and
fairness,’ ” post, at 1 (Ginsburg, J.,
dissenting), could conclude that the purpose of a statute is best
effectuated by placing the burden of persuasion on the defendant.
Moreover, I agree with much of what Justice Ginsburg has written
about the special aspects of this statute. I have, however, decided
to join the Court’s disposition of this case, not only for
the reasons set forth in Justice O’Connor’s opinion,
but also because I believe that we should presume that public
school officials are properly performing their difficult
responsibilities under this important statute.
