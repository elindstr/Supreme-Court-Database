															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															HERMAN AVERY GUNDY, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

															[June 20, 2019]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment.

															The Constitution confers on Congress certain “legislative [p]owers,” Art. I, §1, and does not permit Congress to delegate them to another branch of the Government.  See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,

531 U.S. 457, 472 (2001).  Nevertheless, since 1935, the Court has uniformly rejected nondelegation arguments and has upheld provisions that authorized agencies to adopt important rules pursuant to extraordinarily capacious standards.  See ibid.

															If a majority of this Court were willing to reconsider the approach we have taken for the past 84 years, I would support that effort.  But because a majority is not willing to do that, it would be freakish to single out the provision at issue here for special treatment.

															Because I cannot say that the statute lacks a discern- able standard that is adequate under the approach this Court has taken for many years, I vote to affirm.
