    Justice Thomas,
dissenting.

															
     Petitioner must rely on Penry
v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302 (1989), to argue that Texas’ special issues
framework unconstitutionally limited the discretion of his
sentencing jury.  I have long maintained, however, that
Penry did “so much violence to so many of this
Court’s settled precedents in an area of fundamental
constitutional law, [that] it cannot command the force of
stare decisis.”  Graham v. Collins,
506 U.S. 461, 497
(1993) (concurring opinion).  I therefore agree with Justice
Scalia that a certificate of appealability cannot be issued
based upon an “insubstantial right … derive[d] from
case law in which this Court has long left the Constitution
behind and embraced contradiction.”  Ante, at 2
(dissenting opinion).  I respectfully dissent.
