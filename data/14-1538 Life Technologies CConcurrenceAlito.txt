															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															LIFE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, et al., PETITIONERS v. PROMEGA CORPORATION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[February 22, 2017]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I join all but Part II–C of the Court’s opinion.  It is clear from the text of

35 U. S. C. §271(f) that Congress intended not only to fill the gap created by Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 

406 U. S. 518 (1972)
—where all of the components of the invention were manufactured in the United States, id., at 524—but to go at least a little further.  How much further is the question in this case, and the genesis of §271(f) sheds no light on that question.

															I note, in addition, that while the Court holds that a single component cannot constitute a substantial portion of an invention’s components for §271(f)(1) purposes, I do not read the opinion to suggest that any number greater than one is sufficient.  In other words, today’s opinion establishes that more than one component is necessary, but does not address how much more.
