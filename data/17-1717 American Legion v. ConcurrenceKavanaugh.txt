															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															I join the Court’s eloquent and persuasive opinion in full.  I write separately to emphasize two points.

															I

															Consistent with the Court’s case law, the Court today applies a history and tradition test in examining and upholding the constitutionality of the Bladensburg Cross.  See Marsh v. Chambers,

463 U.S. 783, 787–792, 795 (1983); Van Orden v. Perry,

545 U.S. 677, 686–690 (2005) (plurality opinion); Town of Greece v. Galloway,

572 U.S. 565, 575–578 (2014).

															As this case again demonstrates, this Court no longer applies the old test articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman,
403 U.S. 602 (1971).  The Lemon test examined, among other things, whether the challenged government action had a primary effect of advancing or endorsing religion.  If Lemon guided this Court’s understanding of the Establishment Clause, then many of the Court’s Establishment Clause cases over the last 48 years would have been decided differently, as I will explain.

															The opinion identifies five relevant categories of Establishment Clause cases: (1) religious symbols on government property and religious speech at government events; (2) religious accommodations and exemptions from generally applicable laws; (3) government benefits and tax exemptions for religious organizations; (4) religious expression in public schools; and (5) regulation of private religious speech in public forums.  See ante, at 15, n. 16.

															The Lemon test does not explain the Court’s decisions in any of those five categories.

															In the first category of cases, the Court has relied on history and tradition and upheld various religious symbols on government property and religious speech at government events.  See, e.g., Marsh, 463 U. S., at 787–792, 795; Van Orden, 545 U. S., at 686–690 (plurality opinion); Town of Greece, 572 U. S., at 575–578.  The Court does so again today.  Lemon does not account for the results in these cases.

															In the second category of cases, this Court has allowed legislative accommodations for religious activity and upheld legislatively granted religious exemptions from generally applicable laws.  See, e.g., Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos,

483 U.S. 327 (1987); Cutter v. Wilkinson,

544 U.S. 709 (2005).  But accommodations and exemptions “by definition” have the effect of advancing or endorsing religion to some extent.  Amos, 483 U. S., at 347 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (quotation altered).  Lemon, fairly applied, does not justify those decisions.

															In the third category of cases, the Court likewise has upheld government benefits and tax exemptions that go to religious organizations, even though those policies have the effect of advancing or endorsing religion.  See, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York,

397 U.S. 664 (1970); Mueller v. Allen,

463 U.S. 388 (1983); Mitchell v. Helms,

530 U.S. 793 (2000) (plurality opinion); Zelman v. Simmons-Harris,

536 U.S. 639 (2002); Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U. S. ___ (2017).  Those outcomes are not easily reconciled with Lemon.

															In the fourth category of cases, the Court has proscribed government-sponsored prayer in public schools.  The Court has done so not because of Lemon, but because the Court concluded that government-sponsored prayer in public schools posed a risk of coercion of students.  The Court’s most prominent modern case on that subject,  Lee v. Weisman,

505 U.S. 577 (1992), did not rely on Lemon.  In short, Lemon was not necessary to the Court’s decisions holding government-sponsored school prayers unconstitutional.

															In the fifth category, the Court has allowed private religious speech in public forums on an equal basis with secular speech.  See, e.g., Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.,

508 U.S. 384 (1993); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette,

515 U.S. 753 (1995); Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,

515 U.S. 819 (1995); Good News Club v. Milford Central School,

533 U.S. 98 (2001).  That practice does not violate the Establishment Clause, the Court has ruled.  Lemon does not explain those cases.

															Today, the Court declines to apply Lemon in a case in the religious symbols and religious speech category, just as the Court declined to apply Lemon in Town of Greece v. Galloway, Van Orden v. Perry, and Marsh v. Chambers.  The Court’s decision in this case again makes clear that the Lemon test does not apply to Establishment Clause cases in that category.  And the Court’s decisions over the span of several decades demonstrate that the Lemon test is not good law and does not apply to Establishment Clause cases in any of the five categories.

															On the contrary, each category of Establishment Clause cases has its own principles based on history, tradition, and precedent.  And the cases together lead to an overarching set of principles: If the challenged government practice is not coercive and if it (i) is rooted in history and tradition; or (ii) treats religious people, organizations, speech, or activity equally to comparable secular people, organizations, speech, or activity; or (iii) represents a permissible legislative accommodation or exemption from a generally applicable law, then there ordinarily is no Establishment Clause violation.[1]*

															The practice of displaying religious memorials, particularly religious war memorials, on public land is not coercive and is rooted in history and tradition.  The Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Cf. Town of Greece,

572 U.S. 565.

															II

															The Bladensburg Cross commemorates soldiers who gave their lives for America in World War I.  I agree with the Court that the Bladensburg Cross is constitutional.  At the same time, I have deep respect for the plaintiffs’ sincere objections to seeing the cross on public land.  I have great respect for the Jewish war veterans who in an amicus brief say that the cross on public land sends a message of exclusion.  I recognize their sense of distress and alienation.  Moreover, I fully understand the deeply religious nature of the cross.  It would demean both believers and nonbelievers to say that the cross is not religious, or not all that religious.  A case like this is difficult because it represents a clash of genuine and important interests.  Applying our precedents, we uphold the constitutionality of the cross.  In doing so, it is appropriate to also restate this bedrock constitutional principle: All citizens are equally American, no matter what religion they are, or if they have no religion at all.

															The conclusion that the cross does not violate the Establishment Clause does not necessarily mean that those who object to it have no other recourse.  The Court’s ruling allows the State to maintain the cross on public land.  The Court’s ruling does not require the State to maintain the cross on public land.  The Maryland Legislature could enact new laws requiring removal of the cross or transfer of the land.  The Maryland Governor or other state or local executive officers may have authority to do so under current Maryland law.  And if not, the legislature could enact new laws to authorize such executive action.  The Maryland Constitution, as interpreted by the Maryland Court of Appeals, may speak to this question.  And if not, the people of Maryland can amend the State Constitution.

															Those alternative avenues of relief illustrate a fundamental feature of our constitutional structure: This Court is not the only guardian of individual rights in America.  This Court fiercely protects the individual rights secured by the U. S. Constitution.  See, e.g., West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette,

319 U.S. 624 (1943); Wisconsin v. Yoder,

406 U.S. 205 (1972).  But the Constitution sets a floor for the protection of individual rights.  The constitutional floor is sturdy and often high, but it is a floor.  Other federal, state, and local government entities generally possess authority to safeguard individual rights above and beyond the rights secured by the U. S. Constitution.  See generally J. Sutton, 51 Imperfect Solutions (2018); Brennan, State Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights, 90 Harv. L. Rev. 489 (1977).
Notes

*That is not to say that challenged government actions outside that safe harbor are unconstitutional.  Any such cases must be analyzed under the relevant Establishment Clause principles and precedents.
