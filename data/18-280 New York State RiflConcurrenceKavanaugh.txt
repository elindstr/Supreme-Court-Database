															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															NEW YORK STATE RIFLE & PISTOL ASSOCIATION, INC., et al., PETITIONERS v. CITY OF NEW YORK, NEW YORK, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit

															[April 27, 2020]

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring.

															I agree with the per curiam opinion’s resolution of the procedural issues before us—namely, that petitioners’ claim for injunctive relief against New York City’s old rule is moot and that petitioners’ new claims should be addressed as appropriate in the first instance by the Court of Appeals and the District Court on remand.

															I also agree with Justice Alito’s general analysis of Heller and McDonald.  Post, at 25; see District of Columbia v. Heller,

554 U.S. 570 (2008); McDonald v. Chicago,

561 U.S. 742 (2010); Heller v. District of Columbia, 670 F.3d 1244 (CADC 2011) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  And I share Justice Alito’s concern that some federal and state courts may not be properly applying Heller and McDonald.  The Court should address that issue soon, perhaps in one of the several
 
Second Amendment cases with petitions for certiorari now pending before the Court.
