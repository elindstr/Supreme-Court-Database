FLORIDA, IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT
on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eleventh circuit
[January 12, 2005]
   Justice O’Connor,
concurring.

															   I join the Court’s opinion.
I write separately to emphasize that, even under the current
statutory scheme, it is possible for the Government to detain
inadmissible aliens for more than six months after they have been
ordered removed. For one thing, the 6-month presumption we
described in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678 (2001), is
just that—a presumption. The Court notes that the Government
has not suggested here any reason why it takes longer to effect
removal of inadmissible aliens than it does to effect removal of
other aliens. It is conceivable, however, that a longer period
is “reasonably necessary,” id., at
689, to effect removal of inadmissible aliens as a class. If the
Government shows that to be true, then detention beyond six months
will be lawful within the meaning we ascribed to 8 U. S. C.
§1231(a)(6) in Zadvydas.

															   Moreover, the Government has other statutory
means for detaining aliens whose removal is not foreseeable and
whose presence poses security risks. Upon certifying that he has
“reasonable grounds to believe” an alien has engaged in
certain terrorist or other dangerous activity specified by statute,
8 U. S. C. §1226a(a)(3) (2000 ed., Supp. II), the
Secretary of Homeland Security may detain that alien for successive
six-month periods “if the release of the alien will threaten
the national security of the United States or the safety of the
community or any person,” §1226a(a)(6).

															   Finally, any alien released as a result of
today’s holding remains subject to the conditions of
supervised release. See 8 U. S. C. §1231(a)(3); 8 CFR
§241.5 (2004). And, if he fails to comply with the conditions
of release, he will be subject to criminal
penalties—including further detention. See 8 U. S. C.
§1253(b); Zadvydas, supra, at 695 (“We
nowhere deny the right of Congress . . . to subject [aliens] to
supervision within conditions when released from detention, or to
incarcerate them where appropriate for violations of those
conditions”).
