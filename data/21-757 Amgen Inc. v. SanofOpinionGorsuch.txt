															AMGEN INC., et al., PETITIONERS v.
SANOFI, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[May 18, 2023]

															

															Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															The development of antibody drugs has yielded
life-changing therapies. Individuals across the world now rely on
antibody drugs to treat conditions ranging from Crohn’s
disease to cancer. This case concerns patents covering antibodies
that help reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
sometimes called LDL cholesterol (for the obvious reason) or bad
cholesterol (because it can lead to cardiovascular disease, heart
attacks, and strokes).

															The case comes to us this way. Several years
ago, petitioners (Amgen) obtained two patents. Together, these
patents claim a monopoly over all antibodies that (1) bind to
specific amino acids on a naturally occurring protein known as
PCSK9, and (2) block PCSK9 from impairing the body’s
mechanism for removing LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Soon
after receiving these patents, Amgen sued respondents (Sanofi) for
infringement. In response, Sanofi argued that the patents were
invalid under §112 of the Patent Act. That provision requires
a patent applicant to describe its invention “in such full,
clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in
the art . . . to make and use the [invention].” 35
U. S. C. §112(a). Sanofi contended that

															

															Amgen’s patents failed to meet this
standard because they sought to claim for Amgen’s exclusive
use potentially millions more antibodies than the company had
taught scientists to make. In the end, both the district court and
Federal Circuit sided with Sanofi. The question we face is whether
to disturb their judgment.

															I

															A

															The immune system produces antibodies as a
defense to foreign agents called antigens. When a particular
antigen—a virus, for example—enters the body, the
immune system generates antibodies to attack it. In a successful
attack, the antibodies target and bind to the antigen, stopping it
from causing harm to the body. See Brief for Sir Gregory Paul
Winter et al. as Amici Curiae 8 (Winter Brief );
M. Lemley & J. Sherkow, The Antibody Patent Paradox,
132 Yale L. J. 994, 1001–1002 (2023).

															Antibodies are incredibly diverse. Some
scientists estimate that there may be as many unique antibodies as
there are stars in the galaxy. See id., at 1003; see also B.
Briney, A. Inderbitzin, C. Joyce, & D. Burton, Commonality
Despite Exceptional Diversity in the Baseline Human Antibody
Repertoire, 566 Nature 393, 397 (No. 7744, Feb. 2019) (estimating
that the immune system could potentially generate up to a
quintillion unique antibodies). This diversity shows up in both
structure and function.

															Start with structure. “When scientists
refer to an antibody’s ‘structure,’ ”
they may have in mind “several related concepts,” each
of which describes “what an antibody is.” Winter
Brief 10. Antibodies are made up of amino acids, and scientists
commonly identify a particular antibody according to its specific
sequence of amino acids—what they call an antibody’s
“ ‘primary structure.’ ”
Id., at 9–10. But antibodies are not just linear
chains of amino acids. As the atoms of the amino acids interact
with each other, they create folds that result in complex
three-dimensional shapes. Ibid. Scientists refer to an
antibody’s intricate topography as its “tertiary
structure.” Id., at 10.

															An antibody’s structure does much to
dictate its function—its ability to bind to an antigen and,
in some instances, to block other molecules in the body from doing
the same. “For an antibody to bind to an antigen, the two
surfaces have to fit together and contact each other at multiple
points.” Id., at 11. But just because an antibody can
bind to an antigen does not mean that it can also block. To bind
and block, the antibody must establish a sufficiently broad,
strong, and stable bond to the antigen. See ibid. Different
antibodies have different binding and blocking capacities based on
the amino acids that compose them and their three-dimensional
shapes. See id., at 11–12.

															Despite recent advances, aspects of antibody
science remain unpredictable. For example, scientists understand
that changing even one amino acid in the sequence can alter an
antibody’s structure and function. See id., at 14. But
scientists cannot always accurately predict exactly how trading one
amino acid for another will affect an antibody’s structure
and function. Ibid. As Amgen’s expert testified at
trial: “ ‘[T]he way in which you get from sequence
to that three-dimensional structure isn’t fully understood
today. It’s going to get a Nobel Prize for somebody at some
point, but translating that sequence into a known three-dimensional
structure is still not possible.’ ” Id., at
14–15.

															B

															While the immune system naturally produces an
army of antibodies to protect us from various harms, scientists are
now able to engineer antibodies to assist in treating diseases.
Some of these lab-made antibodies target not foreign agents but the
body’s own proteins, receptors, and ligands. “While
naturally occurring in our bodies, these [proteins, receptors, and
ligands] can also be involved in inflammatory disorders,
uncontrolled cell growth, or other biological pathways that may be
associated with disease.” Id., at 8.

															One part of this effort has focused on the
creation of antibodies to treat patients with high LDL cholesterol.
A silent killer, LDL cholesterol can contribute to the formation of
plaque in the arteries that may lead to cardiovascular disease,
heart attacks, and strokes. For many people with high LDL
cholesterol, drugs called statins offer an effective treatment. For
others, statins do not work well or come with unwelcome side
effects. In those cases, a relatively new antibody-based treatment
known as a PCSK9 inhibitor may be appropriate. See Amgen
Inc. v. Sanofi, 872 F.3d 1367, 1371 (CA Fed. 2017).

															PCSK9 is a naturally occurring protein that
binds to and degrades LDL receptors. That can pose a problem
because the body produces LDL receptors to perform the beneficial
function of extracting LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. See
ibid. Scientists have understood this much for some time.
But it wasn’t until fairly recently that they began exploring
how antibodies might be used to inhibit PCSK9 from binding to and
degrading LDL receptors as a way to treat patients with high LDL
cholesterol.

															In the mid-2000s, a number of pharmaceutical
companies began looking into the possibility of making antibodies
to target PCSK9. See Brief for Respondents 7; Brief for Arnold
Ventures et al. as Amici Curiae 17–20. More
precisely, they sought to create antibodies that could bind to a
particular region of PCSK9 called the “sweet spot.” See
Brief for Petitioners 10–11. The sweet spot is a sequence of
15 amino acids out of PCSK9’s 692 total amino acids.
Id., at 11. By binding to the sweet spot, scientists found,
an antibody could prevent PCSK9 from binding to and degrading LDL
receptors. See id., at 10–11; Amgen, 872
F. 3d, at 1371.

															Eventually, Amgen developed a PCSK9-inhibiting
drug that it marketed under the name Repatha, and Sanofi produced
one it labeled Praluent. Each drug employs a distinct antibody with
its own unique amino acid sequence. See id., at
1371–1372; Brief for Respondents 8–10. In 2011, Amgen
obtained a patent for the antibody employed in Repatha, and Sanofi
received one covering the antibody used in Praluent. See
id., at 8, 9. Each patent describes the relevant antibody by
its amino acid sequence. See ibid. Neither of these patents
is at issue in this case.

															Instead, our dispute focuses on two additional
patents Amgen obtained in 2014 that relate back to the
company’s 2011 patent. See U. S. Patent No. 8,829,165
(Sept. 9, 2014); U. S. Patent No. 8,859,741
(Oct. 14, 2014). We refer to them as the ’165 and
’741 patents. In particular, this case revolves around claims
19 and 29 of the ’165 patent and claim 7 of the ’741
patent. See 987 F.3d 1080, 1082 (CA Fed. 2021). In these claims,
Amgen did not seek protection for any particular antibody described
by amino acid sequence. Instead, Amgen purported to claim for
itself “the entire genus” of antibodies that
(1) “bind to specific amino acid residues on
PCSK9,” and (2) “block PCSK9 from binding to [LDL
receptors].” Amgen, 872 F. 3d, at 1372.

															As part of its submission to the patent office,
Amgen identified the amino acid sequences of 26 antibodies that
perform these two functions, and it depicted the three-dimensional
structures of two of these 26 antibodies. 987 F. 3d, at 1083.
But beyond that, Amgen only offered scientists two methods to make
other antibodies that perform the binding and blocking functions it
described. The first method is what Amgen calls the
“roadmap.” Brief for Petitioners 13. At a high level,
the roadmap directs scientists to: (1) generate a range of
antibodies in the lab; (2) test those antibodies to determine
whether any bind to PCSK9; (3) test those antibodies that bind
to PCSK9 to determine whether any bind to the sweet spot as
described in the claims; and (4) test those antibodies that
bind to the sweet spot as described in the claims to determine
whether any block PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors. See
id., at 13–14. The second method is what Amgen calls
“conservative substitution.” Id., at 14, 17.
This technique requires scientists to: (1) start with an
antibody known to perform the described functions; (2) replace
select amino acids in the antibody with other amino acids known to
have similar properties; and (3) test the resulting antibody
to see if it also performs the described functions. See id.,
at 14–15.

															C

															Soon after receiving the ’165 and
’741 patents, Amgen sued Sanofi for infringing them. Sanofi
replied that it was not liable to Amgen because the relevant claims
were invalid as a matter of law. Invalid, Sanofi said, because
Amgen had not enabled a person skilled in the art to make and use
all of the antibodies that perform the two functions Amgen
described in its claims. See 987 F. 3d, at 1083–1085.
While Amgen had identified the amino acid sequences of 26
antibodies that bind to PCSK9 and block it from binding to LDL
receptors, Sanofi observed that Amgen’s claims cover
potentially millions more undisclosed antibodies that perform these
same functions. And, Sanofi argued, neither of the two methods
Amgen had outlined for generating additional antibodies with the
same functions enable a person skilled in the art to do so
reliably. Instead, Sanofi submitted, those methods require
scientists to engage in little more than a trial-and-error process
of discovery. See id., at 1085.

															After lengthy proceedings, the district court
granted Sanofi judgment as a matter of law, concluding that the
claims at issue “are not enabled.” 2019 WL 4058927, *13
(Del., Aug. 28, 2019). The Federal Circuit affirmed. 987
F. 3d, at 1088. It determined that “no reasonable
factfinder could conclude” that Amgen had provided
“adequate guidance” to make and use the claimed
antibodies “beyond the narrow scope of the [26] working
examples” it had identified by their amino acid sequences.
Ibid. In response to Amgen’s petition for certiorari,
we agreed to take up the case. 598 U. S. ___ (2022).

															II

															The Constitution vests Congress with the power
to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by
securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive
Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” Art. I,
§8, cl. 8. Right there in the text, one finds the outline
of what this Court has called the patent “bargain.”
Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats,
Inc., 489 U.S.
141, 150 (1989). In exchange for bringing “new designs
and technologies into the public domain through disclosure,”
so they may benefit all, an inventor receives a limited term of
“protection from competitive exploitation.” Id.,
at 151; see also The Federalist No. 43, p. 272 (C. Rossiter
ed. 1961) (J. Madison) (explaining that in such cases “[t]he
public good fully coincides . . . with the claims of
individuals”).

															Congress has exercised this authority from the
start. The Patent Act of 1790 promised up to a 14-year monopoly to
any applicant who “invented or discovered any useful art,
manufacture, . . . or device, or any improvement therein
not before known or used.” Act of Apr. 10, 1790,
§1, 1 Stat. 110. Reflecting the quid-pro-quo
premise of patent law, the statute required the applicant to
deposit with the Secretary of State a “specification
. . . so particular . . . as not only to
distinguish the invention or discovery from other things before
known and used, but also to enable a workman or other person
skilled in the art or manufacture . . . to make,
construct, or use the same.” §2, ibid. The
statute made clear that this disclosure would ensure “the
public may have the full benefit [of the invention or discovery],
after the expiration of the patent term.” Ibid.

															Even as Congress has revised the patent laws
over time, it has left this “enablement” obligation
largely intact. See 35 U. S. C. §§111, 112.
Section 111 of the current Patent Act provides that a patent
application “shall include . . . a
specification as prescribed by section 112.”
§111(a)(2)(A). Section 112, in turn, requires a specification
to include “a written description of the invention, and of
the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear,
concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the
art . . . to make and use the same.”
§112(a). So today, just as in 1790, the law secures for the
public its benefit of the patent bargain by ensuring that,
“upon the expiration of [the patent], the knowledge of the
invention [i]nures to the people, who are thus enabled without
restriction to practice it.” United States v.
Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U.S.
178, 187 (1933); see also Grant v. Raymond, 6
Pet. 218, 247 (1832) (Marshall, C. J.) (“This is
necessary in order to give the public, after the privilege shall
expire, the advantage for which the privilege is allowed, and is
the foundation of the power to issue a patent.”);
Whittemore v. Cutter, 29 F. Cas. 1120, 1122
(No. 17,600) (CC Mass. 1813) (Story, J.) (“If therefore
[the disclosure] be so obscure, loose, and imperfect, that this
cannot be done, it is defrauding the public of all the
consideration, upon which the monopoly is granted.”).

															This Court has addressed the enablement
requirement on many prior occasions. See, e.g., Wood
v. Underhill, 5 How. 1 (1846); O’Reilly v.
Morse, 15 How. 62 (1854); The Incandescent Lamp
Patent, 159 U.S.
465 (1895); Minerals Separation, Ltd. v.
Hyde, 242 U.S.
261 (1916); Holland Furniture Co. v. Perkins Glue
Co., 277 U.S.
245 (1928). While the technologies in these older cases may
seem a world away from the antibody treatments of today, the
decisions are no less instructive for it.

															Begin with Morse. While crossing the
Atlantic Ocean in 1832 aboard a ship named Sully, Samuel
Morse found himself in conversation with other passengers about
“experiments and discoveries” around electromagnetism.
15 How., at 68. “In the course of this discussion, it
occurred to [Morse] that, by means of electricity, signs
representing figures, letters, or words, might be legibly written
down at any distance.” Id., at 69. So clear was the
idea in Morse’s mind that, “[b]efore he landed in the
United States, he had . . . drawn out in his sketch book
. . . the form of an instrument for an electro-magnetic
telegraph.” Ibid.

															Immediately upon his arrival in New York, Morse
showed his brothers his sketches. See id., at 69–70.
He spent the next few years refining his invention. See id.,
at 70–76. The “great difficulty” he faced was
that “the galvanic current, however strong in the beginning,
became gradually weaker as it advanced on the wire[,] and was not
strong enough to produce a mechanical effect, after a certain
distance.” Id., at 107. By 1837, Morse had a solution:
“combining two or more electric or galvanic circuits, with
independent batteries for the purpose of overcoming the diminished
force of electro-magnetism in long circuits.” Id., at
109. Morse demonstrated his telegraph the following year at the
Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, and he displayed it soon after
in Congress. See id., at 76. He received a patent in 1840,
which reissued in 1848. See id., at 81–83.

															The litigation that brought Morse before this
Court concerned a telegraphic system that Henry O’Reilly had
installed between Louisville and Nashville. See id., at 65.
Morse sued O’Reilly for infringement, alleging that
O’Reilly’s system was “identical with”
Morse’s own. Id., at 66. O’Reilly mounted a
number of defenses, including that Morse’s patent was void
because it lacked an adequate specification. See id., at
99–101, 112.

															Morse’s patent included eight claims, and
this Court had no trouble upholding seven of them—those
limited to the telegraphic structures and systems he had designed.
See id., at 85–86, 112, 117. But the Court paused on
the eighth. That claim covered “the essence” of the
invention, which Morse described as “the use of the motive
power of the electric or galvanic current . . . however
developed for marking or printing intelligible characters, signs,
or letters, at any distances.” Id., at 112 (internal
quotation marks omitted). Leaving no doubt about this claim’s
scope, Morse stated plainly: “ ‘I do not propose
to limit myself to the specific machinery or parts of machinery
described in the foregoing specification and
claims.’ ” Ibid.

															The Court held the eighth claim “too
broad, and not warranted by law.” Id., at 113. The
problem was that it covered all means of achieving
telegraphic communication, yet Morse had not described how to make
and use them all. See id., at 113–117; see also 3
Chisum on Patents §7.03[1], pp. 7–18 to 7–19
(2021). “[I]f the eighth claim . . . can be
maintained,” the Court concluded, “there was no
necessity for any specification, further than to say that he had
discovered that, by using the motive power of electro-magnetism, he
could print intelligible characters at any distance.” 15
How., at 119. “[I]t will be admitted on all hands, that no
patent could have issued on such a specification.”
Ibid.

															Consider, too, Incandescent Lamp. For
much of the 19th century, gas lamps helped illuminate streets and
supplemented candles inside homes, factories, offices, and
theaters. But gas lighting had drawbacks. It took effort to ignite
lamps each night and extinguish them each morning. Then there were
the problems of soot and fumes. See R. Stross, The Wizard of Menlo
Park 84–85 (2007) (Stross). By the 1870s, many had
experimented with other forms of lighting, including incandescence
and the arc light. 159 U. S., at 470. But these alternatives
burned unreliably or with unbearable brightness. See id., at
470–471. The latter problem in particular led one
observer to lament this “new sort of urban star,” which
shines “horrible, unearthly, obnoxious” light.
R. L. Stevenson, A Plea for Gas Lamps, in Virginibus Puerisque
and Other Papers 295 (1881).

															Enter Thomas Edison. From his laboratory in
Menlo Park, Edison and a team toiled to improve upon the prevailing
method of incandescent lighting, which tended to employ carbon
filaments. 159 U. S., at 471–473. The problem with
carbon filaments was that they disintegrated rapidly. In a sense,
“carbon contained in itself the elements of its own
destruction.” Id., at 471. Seeking an alternative,
Edison tinkered for a time with platinum, but it was expensive and
difficult to bring to the point of incandescence without melting.
Stross 78, 82. Eventually, Edison dispatched men across the globe
to collect specimens of bamboo. Id., at 109–110. One
sample from Japan worked brilliantly because “[its] fibres
[ran] more nearly parallel than in other species of wood.”
159 U. S., at 473. Satisfied, Edison arranged to have a
Japanese farmer supply all of the bamboo he would ever need. Stross
110.

															But there was a catch. William Sawyer and Albon
Man had obtained a patent for an “ ‘electric
lamp’ ” with an “ ‘incandescing
conductor’ ” made of
“ ‘carbonized fibrous or textile
material,’ ” which they claimed was an improvement
over conductors made of “ ‘mineral or gas
carbon.’ ” 159 U. S., at 466, 468. Sawyer and
Man’s patent had not won them commercial success. They had
designed a lamp with a conductor made of carbonized paper, but the
lamp proved defective and quickly fell out of use. See id.,
at 471–472. Still, their failure did not stop them from
seeking to share in some of Edison’s success. Sawyer and Man
alleged that Edison’s lamp infringed their patent because it
“made use of a fibrous or textile material, covered by the
patent.” Id., at 471. What was that offending
material? Bamboo.

															This Court sided with Edison. It held that
Sawyer and Man’s patent claimed much but enabled little.
“Sawyer and Man supposed they had discovered in carbonized
paper the best material for an incandescent conductor.”
Id., at 472. But “[i]nstead of confining themselves to
carbonized paper, as they might properly have done, and in fact did
in their third claim, they made a broad claim for every fibrous and
textile material.” Ibid. Even that broad claim
“might” have been permissible, the Court allowed, if
Sawyer and Man had disclosed “a quality common” to
fibrous and textile substances that made them
“peculiarly” adapted to incandescent lighting.
Ibid. Had they done so, others would have known how to
select among such materials to make an operable lamp. But the
record showed that most fibrous and textile materials failed to
work. Only through “painstaking experimentation” did
Edison discover that bamboo “answered the required
purpose.” Id., at 475–476. The Court summed up
things this way: “[T]he fact that paper happens to belong to
the fibrous kingdom did not invest [Sawyer and Man] with
sovereignty over this entire kingdom.” Id., at
476.

															The Court returned to these principles in
Holland Furniture. There, the evidence indicated that animal
glue has properties that have long made it excellent for wood
veneering. See 277 U. S., at 247. Seeking a substitute,
Perkins Glue Company had developed and patented a starch glue
similar enough to animal glue that craftsmen could also use it for
wood veneering. See ibid. Yet Perkins’s patent
included a claim that went beyond the specific starch glue it
manufactured. See id., at 250–251. This claim covered
all “starch glue which, [when] combined with about three
parts or less by weight of water, will have substantially the same
properties as animal glue.” Id., at 251.
Perkins’s specification instructed gluemakers to choose a
“starch ingredient” with “such qualities”
that it would yield a product “ ‘as good as animal
glue’ ” for wood veneering “when combined
with three parts of water and with alkali.” Id., at
256.

															The Court held this broad claim invalid for lack
of enablement. Id., at 258. The specification described the
key input—the “starch ingredient”—in terms
of its “use or function” rather than its
“physical characteristics or chemical properties.”
Id., 256. And that left gluemakers in a bind. As the Court
put it: “One attempting to use or avoid the use of
Perkins’ discovery as so claimed and described functionally
could do so only after elaborate experimentation” with
different starches. Id., at 257. To be sure, the Court held,
Perkins was entitled to its patent on the specific starch glue it
had invented. See id., at 255. The specification described
that glue’s “characteristic ingredient” with
“particularity.” Ibid. But just as Morse could
not claim all means of telegraphic communication, and Sawyer and
Man could not claim all fibrous and textile materials for
incandescence, Perkins could not claim all starch glues made from
whatever starch happened to perform as well as animal glue. To hold
otherwise, the Court said, “would extend the monopoly beyond
the invention.” Id., at 258.

															Our decisions in Morse, Incandescent
Lamp, and Holland Furniture reinforce the simple
statutory command. If a patent claims an entire class of processes,
machines, manufactures, or compositions of matter, the
patent’s specification must enable a person skilled in the
art to make and use the entire class. In other words, the
specification must enable the full scope of the invention as
defined by its claims. The more one claims, the more one must
enable. See §112(a); see also Continental Paper Bag Co.
v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., 210 U.S.
405, 419 (1908) (“[T]he claims measure the
invention.”).

															That is not to say a specification always must
describe with particularity how to make and use every single
embodiment within a claimed class. For instance, it may suffice to
give an example (or a few examples) if the specification also
discloses “some general quality . . . running
through” the class that gives it “a peculiar fitness
for the particular purpose.” Incandescent Lamp, 159
U. S., at 475. In some cases, disclosing that general quality
may reliably enable a person skilled in the art to make and use all
of what is

															

															claimed, not merely a subset. See id., at
475–476.[1]

															Nor is a specification necessarily inadequate
just because it leaves the skilled artist to engage in some measure
of adaptation or testing. In Wood, a patent claimed a
process for making bricks by mixing coal dust into clay. 5 How., at
4. The patent included “a general rule” about the
proportion of dust and clay to use and offered two alternative
proportions “where the clay has some peculiarity.”
Id., at 5. The Court upheld the claim, recognizing that
“some small difference in the proportions must occasionally
be required” given the varieties of clay. Ibid.
Similarly, in Minerals Separation, the Court dismissed a
challenge to a claimed process for separating metal from mineral
ores. 242 U. S., at 270. The record showed that
“preliminary tests” were required to adapt the process
to any particular ore. Ibid. Once more, the Court explained
that “the certainty which the law requires in patents is not
greater than is reasonable.” Ibid. And because the
“composition of ores varies infinitely,” it was
“impossible to specify in a patent the precise treatment
which would be most successful and economical in each case.”
Id., at 271.[2]

															Decisions such as Wood and Minerals
Separation establish that a specification may call for a
reasonable amount of experimentation to make and use a patented
invention. What is reasonable in any case will depend on the nature
of the invention and the underlying art. See Minerals
Separation, 242 U. S., at 270–271; see also
Mowry v. Whitney, 14 Wall. 620, 644 (1872)
(“[T]he definiteness of a specification must vary with the
nature of its subject. Addressed as it is to those skilled in the
art, it may leave something to their skill in applying the
invention.”). But in allowing that much tolerance, courts
cannot detract from the basic statutory requirement that a
patent’s specification describe the invention “in such
full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person
skilled in the art” to “make and use” the
invention. §112(a). Judges may no more subtract from the
requirements for obtaining a patent that Congress has prescribed
than they may add to them. See Bilski v. Kappos,
561 U.S.
593, 602–603, 612 (2010).

															III

															With these principles in mind, we return to
claims 19 and 29 of the ’165 patent and claim 7 of the
’741 patent. In doing so, we do not doubt that Amgen’s
specification enables the 26 exemplary antibodies it identifies by
their amino acid sequences. Even Sanofi concedes that description
is enough to allow a person skilled in the art to make and use
those embodiments. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 68. But the claims before
us sweep much broader than those 26 antibodies. And we agree with
the lower courts that Amgen has failed to enable all that it has
claimed, even allowing for a reasonable degree of
experimentation.

															While the technology at the heart of this case
is thoroughly modern, from the law’s perspective
Amgen’s claims bear more than a passing resemblance to those
this Court faced long ago in Morse, Incandescent
Lamp, and Holland Furniture. Amgen seeks to monopolize
an entire class of things defined by their function—every
antibody that both binds to particular areas of the sweet spot of
PCSK9 and blocks PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors. The record
reflects that this class of antibodies does not include just the 26
that Amgen has described by their amino acid sequences, but a
“vast” number of additional antibodies that it has not.
987 F. 3d, at 1085, 1088; see 2019 WL 4058927, *8 (“at
least millions of candidates”); see also Tr. of Oral Arg.
52–53. Much as Morse sought to claim all telegraphic forms of
communication, Sawyer and Man sought to claim all fibrous and
textile materials for incandescence, and Perkins sought to claim
all starch glues that work as well as animal glue for wood
veneering, Amgen seeks to claim “sovereignty over [an] entire
kingdom” of antibodies. Incandescent Lamp, 159
U. S., at 476.

															That poses Amgen with a challenge. For if our
cases teach anything, it is that the more a party claims, the
broader the monopoly it demands, the more it must enable. That
holds true whether the case involves telegraphs devised in the 19th
century, glues invented in the 20th, or antibody treatments
developed in the 21st. To be fair, Amgen does not dispute this
much. It freely admits that it seeks to claim for itself an entire
universe of antibodies. Still, it says, its broad claims are
enabled because scientists can make and use every undisclosed but
functional antibody if they simply follow the company’s
“roadmap” or its proposal for “conservative
substitution.”

															We cannot agree. These two approaches amount to
little more than two research assignments. The first merely
describes step-by-step Amgen’s own trial-and-error method for
finding functional antibodies—calling on scientists to create
a wide range of candidate antibodies and then screen each to see
which happen to bind to PCSK9 in the right place and block it from
binding to LDL receptors. See Part I–B, supra; 987
F. 3d, at 1088; 2019 WL 4058927, *10–*13. The second
isn’t much different. It requires scientists to make
substitutions to the amino acid sequences of antibodies known to
work and then test the resulting antibodies to see if they do
too—an uncertain prospect given the state of the art. See
Parts I–A, I–B, supra; 987 F. 3d, at 1088;
2019 WL 4058927, *10–*13. Whether methods like a
“roadmap” or “conservative substitution”
might suffice to enable other claims in other patents—perhaps
because, as this Court suggested in Incandescent Lamp, the
inventor identifies a quality common to every functional
embodiment, supra, at 13—they do not here. They leave
a scientist about where Sawyer and Man left Edison: forced to
engage in “painstaking experimentation” to see what
works. 159 U. S., at 475. That is not enablement. More nearly,
it is “a hunting license.” Brenner v.
Manson, 383 U.S.
519, 536 (1966).

															Think about it this way. “Imagine a
combination lock with 100 tumblers, each of which can be set to 20
different positions.” Brief for Intellectual Property Law
Professors and Scholars as Amici Curiae 20. “Through
trial and error, imagine that an inventor finds and discloses 26
different successful lock combinations.” Ibid. But
imagine, too, “that the inventor tries to claim much more,
namely all successful combinations,” while instructing others
“to randomly try a large set of combinations and then record
the successful ones.” Id., at 21. Sure enough,
that kind of “roadmap” would produce functional
combinations. Ibid. But it would not enable others to make
and use functional combinations; it would instead leave them to
“random trial-and-error discovery.” Ibid. Like
many analogies, this one may oversimplify a bit, but it captures
the gist of the problem.

															Failing in its primary argument that it has
enabled all of the antibodies it claims, Amgen tries a few
alternative lines of attack. First, it suggests that the Federal
Circuit erred by applying an enablement test unmoored from the
statutory text. As Amgen sees it, that court conflated the question
whether an invention is enabled with the question how long may it
take a person skilled in the art to make every embodiment within a
broad claim. See Brief for Petitioners 24–29; see also
id., at 2, 19–20, 30–36. We do not see it that
way. While we agree with Amgen that enablement is not measured
against the cumulative time and effort it takes to make every
embodiment within a claim, we are not so sure the Federal Circuit
thought otherwise. That court went out of its way to say that it
“do[es] not hold that the effort required to exhaust a genus
is dispositive.” 987 F. 3d, at 1088 (emphasis deleted).
Instead, the court stressed, the problem it saw is the same problem
we see: Amgen offers persons skilled in the art little more than
advice to engage in “trial and error.” Ibid.
(internal quotation marks omitted). In any event, we review
judgments of the lower courts, not statements in their opinions.
See Black v. Cutter Laboratories, 351 U.S.
292, 297 (1956).

															Taking a similar tack, Amgen next argues that
the Federal Circuit erroneously “raise[d] the bar” for
enablement of claims that, like Amgen’s, encompass an entire
“genus” of embodiments defined by their function. Brief
for Petitioners 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). This is
impermissible, Amgen argues, because the Patent Act “provides
a single, universal enablement standard for all
invention[s].” Ibid. (internal quotation marks
omitted). Here, too, we agree with Amgen in principle: There is one
statutory enablement standard. But, once more, we do not understand
the Federal Circuit to have thought differently. Instead, we
understand that court to have recognized only that the more a party
claims for itself the more it must enable. As we have seen, that
much is entirely consistent with Congress’s directive and
this Court’s precedents.

															Finally, Amgen warns that an affirmance risks
“destroy[ing] incentives for breakthrough inventions.”
Id., at 38. But striking the proper balance between
incentivizing inventors and ensuring the public receives the full
benefit of their innovations is a policy judgment that belongs to
Congress. Since 1790, Congress has included an enablement mandate
as one feature among many designed to achieve the balance it
wishes. Our only duty in this case lies in applying that mandate
faithfully.

															*

															Section 112 of the Patent Act reflects
Congress’s judgment that if an inventor claims a lot, but
enables only a little, the public does not receive its benefit of
the bargain. For more than 150 years, this Court has enforced the
statutory enablement requirement according to its terms. If the
Court had not done so in Incandescent Lamp, it might have
been writing decisions like Holland Furniture in the dark.
Today’s case may involve a new technology, but the legal
principle is the same. The judgment is

															Affirmed.
