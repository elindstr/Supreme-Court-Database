															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															LUIS A. NIEVES, et al., PETITIONERS v. RUSSELL P. BARTLETT

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 28, 2019]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															When

42 U. S. C. §1983 was enacted, “the common law recognized probable cause as an important element for ensuring that arrest-based torts did not unduly interfere with the objectives of law enforcement.”  Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 6).  Applying that principle resolves this case: “[P]laintiffs bringing a
 
First Amendment retaliatory-arrest claim under §1983 should have to plead and prove a lack of probable cause.”  Ibid.  The Court acknowledges as much, ante, at 12–13, and I join the portions of the Court’s opinion adopting that rule.[1]  I do not join Part II–D, however, because I do not agree that “a narrow qualification is warranted for circumstances where officers have probable cause to make arrests, but typically exercise their discretion not to do so.”  Ante, at 13–14.  That qualification has no basis in either the common law or our
 
First Amendment precedents.

															As the Court explains, “[w]hen defining the contours of a claim under §1983, we look to ‘common-law principles that were well settled at the time of its enactment.’ ”  Ante, at 12.  Because no common-law tort for retaliatory arrest in violation of the freedom of speech existed when §1983 was enacted, we “look to the common-law torts that ‘provid[e] the closest analogy’ to this claim.”  Lozman, 585 U. S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 4).  Here, those torts are false imprisonment, malicious arrest, and malicious prosecution.  Ibid.

															The existence of probable cause generally excused an officer from liability for these three torts, without regard to the treatment of similarly situated individuals.  For instance, a constable who made an arrest “on reasonable grounds of belief” that a felony had been committed was “excused” from liability for false imprisonment.  T. Cooley, Law of Torts 175 (1879) (Cooley); Lozman, supra, at ___–___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 4–5). And the absence of probable cause was central to both malicious arrest and malicious prosecution.  Cooley 180–181; Lozman, supra, at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 5).  As the Court puts it, “the consistent rule was that officers were not liable for arrests they were privileged to make based on probable cause.”  Ante, at 13.

															Rather than adhere to this rule, the majority carves out an exception to the no-probable-cause requirement for plaintiffs who “presen[t] objective evidence” that they were “arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.”  Ante, at 14.  The common law provides no support for this exception.  Indeed, the majority cites not a single common-law case that supports imposing liability based on an officer’s treatment of similarly situated individuals.  The majority instead suggests that its exception responds to the fact that States today “ ‘permit warrantless misdemeanor arrests’ ” for many “ ‘minor criminal offense[s],’ ” whereas “[w]hen §1983 was adopted, officers were generally privileged to make warrantless arrests for misdemeanors only in limited circumstances.”  Ibid.  But discomfort with the number of warrantless arrests that are privileged today is an issue for state legislatures, not a license for this Court to fashion an exception to a previously “consistent rule.”  Ante, at 13.

															The majority’s exception is also untethered from our
 
First Amendment precedents.  In Hartman v. Moore,

547 U.S. 250 (2006), we expressly declined to create any exceptions to the rule that a plaintiff alleging retaliatory prosecution in violation of the
 
First Amendment must plead and prove the absence of probable cause.  See id., at 264–266, and n. 10.  The majority today imports its “qualification” from our jurisprudence on selective-prosecution claims.  Ante, at 14, 15 (citing United States v. Armstrong,

517 U.S. 456, 465 (1996)).  But “[t]he requirements for a selective-prosecution claim draw on ‘ordinary equal protection standards,’ ” not the
 
First Amendment.  Id., at 465.  That jurisprudence therefore is not relevant here.  Cf. Whren v. United States,

517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996) (“[T]he constitutional basis for objecting to intentionally dis- criminatory application of laws is the Equal Protection Clause . . . ”).

															With no guidance from the common law or relevant precedents, the majority crafts its exception as a matter of policy.  But this “narrow” qualification threatens to derail our retaliation jurisprudence in several ways.  For one, although the majority’s stated concern is with “ ‘warrantless misdemeanor arrests’ ” for “ ‘very minor’ ” offenses like “jaywalking,” ante, at 14, its exception apparently applies to all offenses, including serious felonies.  This overbroad exception thus is likely to encourage protracted litigation about which individuals are “similarly situated,” ibid., while doing little to vindicate
 
First Amendment rights.  Moreover, the majority’s rule risks chilling law enforcement officers from making arrests for fear of liability, thus flouting the reasoning behind the emphasis on probable cause in arrest-based torts at common law.  Lozman, supra, at ___–___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 4–5).  In short, the majority’s exception lacks the support of history, precedent, and sound policy.

															*  *  *

															The requirement that plaintiffs bringing
 
First Amendment retaliatory-arrest claims plead and prove the absence of probable cause is supported by the common law and our
 
First Amendment precedents.  The majority’s new exception has no basis in either.  Accordingly, I join all but Part II–D of the majority opinion.
Notes
1
 Because no party questions whether §1983 claims for retaliatory arrests under the
 
First Amendment are actionable, I assume that §1983 permits such claims.  See Lozman v. Riviera Beach, 585 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2 (2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3, n. 2).
