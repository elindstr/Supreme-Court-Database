															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION,
et al., PETITIONERS v. ABC, INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[June 21, 2012]

															

															Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the
judgment.

															In my view, the Court’s decision in
FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438
U.S. 726 (1978), was wrong when it issued. Time, technological
advances, and the Commission’s untenable rulings in the cases
now before the Court show why Pacifica bears
reconsideration. Cf. FCC v. Fox Television Stations,
Inc., 556 U.S.
502, 532–535 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring).
