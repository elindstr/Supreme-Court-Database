															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															ESTHER KIOBEL, individually and on behalf of
her late husband, Dr. BARINEM KIOBEL, et al., PETI- TIONERS
v. ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM CO. et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the second circuit

															[April 17, 2013]

															

															Justice Kennedy, concurring.

															The opinion for the Court is careful to leave
open a number of significant questions regarding the reach and
interpretation of the Alien Tort Statute. In my view that is a
proper disposition. Many serious concerns with respect to human
rights abuses committed abroad have been addressed by Congress in
statutes such as the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA),
106Stat. 73, note following 28 U. S. C. §1350, and
that class of cases will be determined in the future according to
the detailed statu- tory scheme Congress has enacted. Other cases
may arise with allegations of serious violations of international
law principles protecting persons, cases covered neither by the
TVPA nor by the reasoning and holding of today’s case; and in
those disputes the proper implementation of the pre- sumption
against extraterritorial application may require some further
elaboration and explanation.
