SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 09-530





															NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMIN-
ISTRATION, et al., PETITIONERS v.
ROBERT M. NELSON et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the ninth circuit

															[January 19, 2011]



															   Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.

															
   I agree with Justice Scalia that the Constitution does not protect a right to informational privacy.  Ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment).  No provision in the Constitution mentions such a right.  Cf. Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 605–606 (2003) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (“I can find neither in the Bill of Rights nor any other part of the Constitution a general right of privacy … ” (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).  And the notion that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is a wellspring of unenumerated rights against the Federal Government “strains credulity for even the most casual user of words.”  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 7).
