															TIMOTHY J. SMITH, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eleventh circuit

															[June 15, 2023]

															

															Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															When a conviction is reversed because of a trial
error, this Court has long allowed retrial in nearly all
circumstances. We consider in this case whether the Constitution
requires a different outcome when a conviction is reversed because
the prosecution occurred in the wrong venue and before a jury drawn
from the wrong location. We hold that it does not.

															I

															Timothy Smith is a software engineer and avid
angler from Mobile, Alabama, who spends much of his time fishing,
sailing, and diving in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2018, he discovered
StrikeLines, a company that uses sonar equipment to identify
private, artificial reefs that individuals construct to attract
fish. StrikeLines sells the geographic coordinates of those reefs
to interested parties. This business model irritated Smith, who
believed that StrikeLines was unfairly profiting from the work of
private reef builders.

															Smith used a web application to obtain tranches
of coordinates from the company’s website surreptitiously. He
then announced on a social-media website that he had
StrikeLines’ data and invited readers to message him and
“ ‘see what ree[f ]’ ”
coordinates StrikeLines had discovered. 22 F. 4th 1236, 1239 (CA11
2022) (case below). When contacted by StrikeLines, Smith offered to
remove his social-media posts and fix the company’s security
issues in exchange for “ ‘one
thing’ ”: the coordinates of certain
“ ‘deep grouper spots’ ” that he
had apparently been unable to obtain from the website. Ibid.
The ensuing negotiations over grouper coordinates eventually
failed, leading StrikeLines to contact law-enforcement
authorities.

															Smith was indicted in the Northern District of
Florida for, among other charges, theft of trade secrets. See 18
U. S. C. §1832(a)(1). Before trial, he moved to
dismiss the indictment for lack of venue, citing the
Constitution’s Venue Clause, Art. III, §2,
cl. 3, and its Vicinage Clause, Amdt. 6. He argued that trial
in the Northern District of Florida was improper because he had
accessed the data from Mobile (in the Southern District of Alabama)
and the servers storing StrikeLines’ coordinates were located
in Orlando (in the Middle District of Florida). The District Court
concluded that the jury needed to resolve factual disputes related
to venue, and it therefore denied the motion to dismiss without
prejudice. After the jury returned a verdict of guilty under
§1832(a)(1), Smith moved for a judgment of acquittal based on
improper venue. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29. The District
Court denied the motion, reasoning that StrikeLines felt the
effects of the crime at its headquarters in the Northern District
of Florida.

															On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit held that venue
was improper on the trade secrets charge, but it disagreed with
Smith that this error barred reprosecution. It concluded that the
“remedy for improper venue is vacatur of the conviction, not
acquittal or dismissal with prejudice,” and that the
“Double Jeopardy [C]lause is not implicated by a retrial in a
proper venue.” 22 F. 4th, at 1244.

															We granted certiorari to determine whether the
Constitution permits the retrial of a defendant following a trial
in an improper venue and before a jury drawn from the wrong
district. 598 U. S. ___ (2022).[1]

															II

															A

															Except as prohibited by the Double Jeopardy
Clause, it “has long been the rule that when a defendant
obtains a reversal of a prior, unsatisfied conviction, he may be
retried in the normal course of events.” United States
v. Ewell, 383 U.S.
116, 121 (1966); accord, Bravo-Fernandez v. United
States, 580 U.S. 5, 18–19 (2016). Remedies for
constitutional violations in criminal trials, we have explained,
“should be tailored to the injury suffered from the
constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on
competing interests.” United States v.
Morrison, 449
U.S. 361, 364 (1981). When a conviction is obtained in a
proceeding marred by harmful trial error, “the accused has a
strong interest in obtaining a fair readjudication of his
guilt,” and society “maintains a valid concern for
insuring that the guilty are punished.” Burks v.
United States, 437 U.S.
1, 15 (1978). Therefore, the appropriate remedy for prejudicial
trial error, in almost all circumstances, is simply the award of a
retrial, not a judgment barring reprosecution. See, e.g.,
Morrison, 449 U. S., at 363, 365–367; United
States v. Blue, 384 U.S.
251, 254–255 (1966).[2]

															We have recognized one exception to this general
rule: violations of the Speedy Trial Clause, which we have
described as “generically different” from
“any” other criminal right in the Constitution,
Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S.
514, 519 (1972), preclude retrial. In all other circumstances,
we have found that retrial is the strongest appropriate remedy, and
we have applied this rule to every other Clause of the Sixth
Amendment except for the Vicinage Clause (which we now address
along with the Venue Clause).[3]

															B

															Against this backdrop, we are asked to
consider whether violations of the Venue and Vicinage Clauses are
exceptions to the retrial rule. Text and precedent provide no basis
for that result.

															We start with the Venue Clause, which concerns
the place where a trial must be held. That Clause mandates that the
“Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the
State where the . . . Crimes shall have been
committed.” Art. III, §2, cl. 3.[4] Nothing about the language that frames
this requirement suggests that a new trial in the proper venue is
not an adequate remedy for its violation.

															Smith contends that the purpose of the Venue
Clause supports his argument, but that argument is unpersuasive for
at least two reasons. First, the purpose he attributes to the
Clause is insufficient to justify a departure from the general
retrial rule. Smith primarily argues that the Venue Clause aims to
prevent the infliction of additional harm on a defendant who has
already undergone the hardship of an initial trial in a distant and
improper place. But any criminal trial, whether or not in the right
venue, imposes hardship, and any retrial after a reversal for trial
error adds to that initial harm. Indeed, in some cases, the lost
time, emotional burden, and expense of a flawed initial trial in a
defendant’s home State may exceed the hardship of an initial
trial in a State that is nearby but improper under the Venue
Clause. And the mere burden of a second trial has never justified
an exemption from the retrial rule. See Ewell, 383
U. S., at 121.

															Second, Smith’s argument exaggerates the
connection between the venue right and the hardship of trial in an
improper venue. The most convenient trial venue for a defendant
would presumably be where he lives, and yet the Venue Clause is
keyed to the location of the alleged “Crimes,”
Art. III, §2, cl. 3, “not . . . the
district where the accused resides, or even . . . the
district in which he is personally at the time of committing the
crime,” In re Palliser, 136 U.S.
257, 265 (1890). Thus, the Clause does not allow
“variation . . . for convenience of the
. . . accused.” Johnston v. United
States, 351 U.S.
215, 221 (1956); accord, e.g., Armour Packing Co.
v. United States, 209 U.S.
56, 77 (1908). The State in which a crime is committed may be
far from a defendant’s residence. For example, a resident of
New York charged with committing a crime during a short visit to
Hawaii may be tried in Hawaii under the Venue Clause even though
that trial may be very inconvenient. Equally telling, the Clause
would preclude trial for that crime in New York unless it
somehow extended to the State. See, e.g., Travis v.
United States, 364 U.S.
631, 634–637 (1961) (holding that prosecution was proper
only in Washington, D. C., rather than in the
defendant’s residence in Colorado); United States v.
Lombardo, 241 U.S.
73, 76–78 (1916) (holding the same for a defendant who
resided in Washington State). If avoiding hardship to a defendant
were a “core purpos[e]” of the Venue Clause, Brief for
Petitioner 18, such results would be inexplicable.

															This disconnect between the State where trial
would be least burdensome and the State where a crime was committed
is exacerbated by the fact that many federal crimes occur in
multiple States. We have held that a trial may be held
“ ‘where any part’ ” of a crime
“ ‘can be proved to have been
done.’ ” United States v.
Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U.S.
275, 281 (1999) (quoting Lombardo, 241 U. S., at
77). As a result, the Venue Clause permits a defendant charged with
conspiracy to be tried in any State in which any co-conspirator
took any overt act in furtherance of the endeavor, Hyde v.
United States, 225 U.S.
347, 365–367 (1912), and a defendant charged with
illegally shipping goods may be tried in any State through which
the goods were illegally transported, Armour Packing, 209
U. S., at 76–77. In these cases, as others, we have
repeatedly rejected objections based on the “serious hardship
in . . . prosecutions in places distant from the
[defendant’s] home.” Id., at 77.

															The Vicinage Clause provides no stronger textual
support for petitioner’s argument. That Clause guarantees
“the right to . . . an impartial jury of the State
and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.”
Amdt. 6. The coverage of this Clause “reinforce[s]” the
coverage of the Venue Clause because, in protecting the right to a
jury drawn from the place where a crime occurred, it func- tionally
prescribes the place where a trial must be held.
Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U. S., at 278; Travis, 364
U. S., at 634; see, e.g., Palliser, 136
U. S., at 265. But the Vicinage Clause differs from the Venue
Clause in two ways: it concerns jury composition, not the place
where a trial may be held, and it narrows the place where trial is
permissible by specifying that a jury must be drawn from “the
State and district wherein the crime shall have been
committed.” Amdt. 6 (emphasis added).

															Nothing about these differences dictates a
remedy that is broader than the one awarded when the Venue Clause
is violated. The vicinage right is only one aspect of the
jury-trial rights protected by the Sixth Amendment, and we have
repeatedly acknowledged that retrials are the appropriate remedy
for violations of other jury-trial rights. See, e.g.,
Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___–___
(2020) (slip op., at 22–23) (non-unanimous jury);
Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 580 U.S. 206, 228 (2017)
(racially biased jury); Sheppard v. Maxwell,
384 U.S.
333, 362–363 (1966) (partial jury). Most analogous to the
case before us, we have recognized that retrial is the appropriate
remedy when a defendant is tried by a jury that does not reflect a
fair cross-section of the community. See, e.g.,
Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S.
60, 85–87 (1942). There is no reason to conclude that
trial before a jury drawn from the wrong geographic area demands a
different remedy than trial before a jury drawn inadequately from
within the community.

															C

															Failing to demonstrate that he is entitled to
an acquittal based on text or precedent, Smith appeals to the
historical background of the Venue and Vicinage Clauses. The
history underlying the Clauses cannot justify an exception to the
retrial rule.

															1

															In examining this history, the relevant
starting point, as both parties agree, is the common-law
“vicinage” right, which presumptively entitled
defendants to a jury of the “neighbourhood” where the
crime was allegedly committed. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the
Laws of England 344 (1769) (Blackstone). As a practical matter,
this right imposed a venue requirement: trials needed to be held at
the location where “the matter of fact issuable”
allegedly occurred to allow the “Inhabitants
whereof ” to serve on the jury. 1 E. Coke, Institutes of
the Laws of England §193, at 125 (1628) (Coke).[5]

															Both of these requirements were well settled by
the founding. See, e.g., Rex v. Harris, 3
Burr. 1330, 1334, 97 Eng. Rep. 858, 860 (K. B. 1762) (Wilmot, J.)
(opining that there was “no rule better established”
than “ ‘that all causes shall be tried in the
county, and by the neighbourhood of the place, where the fact is
committed’ ”). Smith contends, however, that the
Constitution not only incorporated this right but
“elevated” it “to an even higher stature in
American law,” and that this enhanced right favors his
preferred remedy. Brief for Petitioner 21. The historical record,
however, does not support this argument.

															There is no question that the founding
generation enthusiastically embraced the vicinage right and wielded
it “as a political argument of the
Revolution.”[6] Prior to
the Revolution, Parliament enacted measures to circumvent local
trials before colonial juries, most notably by authorizing trials
in England for both British soldiers charged with murdering
colonists and colonists accused of treason.[7] The Continental Congress and colonial legislatures
forcefully objected to trials in England before loyalist juries,
characterizing the practice as an affront to the existing
“common law of England, and more especially to the great and
inestimable privilege of being tried by . . . peers of
the vicinage.”[8] The
Declaration of Independence also denounced these laws, under which,
it said, British soldiers were “protect[ed] . . .
by a mock Trial” and colonists were “transport[ed]
. . . beyond the Seas to be tried for pretended
offences.”[9] As States
declared independence, most incorporated some form of a venue or
vicinage clause in their governing documents, but none of these
provisions specified a particular remedy for violations.[10]

															The common-law vicinage right, both as a jury
requirement and as a proxy for venue, remained prominent during
debates over the ratification of the Constitution. As originally
proposed, the Constitution contained only the Venue Clause, which,
as noted, says nothing about jury composition. Appealing to
“ancient common law,” Anti-Federalists objected to this
omission.[11] Federalists
responded that Congress could secure the vicinage right by statute,
analogizing to common law, where “the preservation of this
right [was] in the hands of Parliament.”[12]

															After the ratification of the Constitution,
Congress yielded in part to the Anti-Federalists’ argument
and included a vicinage right in the Sixth Amendment. James
Madison’s initial draft of the Amendment required a jury
“of the vicinage,” 1 Annals of Cong. 435 (1789), but
Congress amended that language so that it guaranteed a jury from
the State of the crime and from any smaller judicial districts that
Congress chose to create.[13]

															This history tells us two important things about
the way in which the Constitution dealt with the common-law
vicinage right. First, the right was highly prized by the founding
generation, and this right undoubtedly inspired the Venue and
Vicinage Clauses. Second, although the Clauses depart in some
respects from the common law—most notably by providing new
specifications about the place where a crime may be
tried—there is no meaningful evidence that the Constitution
altered the remedy prescribed by common law for violations of the
vicinage right.

															2

															With this background in mind, we examine the
remedy at common law for an initial trial in the wrong venue or
before a jury drawn from the wrong vicinage, and we find that this
history does not demand a departure from the retrial rule. By the
time of the founding, compelling evidence supported the conclusion
that pleas of prior acquittal or conviction could not be grounded
on a verdict issued in or returned by a jury from the wrong
vicinage.

															The leading decision at common law was
Arundel’s Case, 6 Co. Rep. 14a, 77 Eng. Rep. 273 (K.
B. 1593), which concerned a vicinage challenge to a jury that had
found the defendant guilty of murder. Id., at 14a–14b,
77 Eng. Rep., at 274. The King’s Bench arrested judgment on
the conviction because the jury was insufficiently local, but it
did not bar retrial. Ibid. Instead, “a new venire
facias [was] awarded to try the issue again.”
Ibid.; see also Vaux’s Case, 4 Co. Rep. 44a,
45a, 76 Eng. Rep. 992, 994 (K. B. 1591) (adopting a similar
rationale for insufficient indictments). Discussing
Arundel’s Case at length, Sir Edward Coke’s
17th-century treatise agreed that juries lacked authority to
convict outside of their vicinage and added that a verdict by an
improperly constituted jury would cause a “mistryall.”
1 Coke §193, at 125; see also 3 id., at 137 (1644);
Rex v. Fenwicke, 1 Keble 546, 83 Eng. Rep. 1104
(K. B. 1662) (recognizing the availability of retrial
“for misawarding of venue”); Rex v.
Talbot, Cro. Car. 311, 312, 79 Eng. Rep. 871, 872 (K. B.
1633) (awarding a new jury venire to remedy a vicinage error).

															Arundel’s remedy remained unchanged
throughout the 18th century. Because “indictments are
local,” one prominent treatise explained, a prior acquittal
on an indictment “laid in an improper county” would not
“bar . . . a subsequent indictment in the proper
county.” 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 526 (6th ed. 1788).
Hale and Blackstone reached similar conclusions. See 2 M. Hale,
History of the Pleas of the Crown 245 (1736) (concluding that a
second prosecution was available for indictments in different
counties because courts “can only inquire touching a
felony” in their own county); 4 Blackstone 368–369
(explaining that a defendant “may be indicted again”
when a judgment of conviction is arrested for failure to adequately
identify “the place” of the crime in the indictment);
see also, e.g., Rex v. Huggins, 2 Ld. Raym.
1574, 1585, 92 Eng. Rep. 518, 525 (K. B. 1730) (approvingly
citing the remedy in Arundel’s Case). In sum, no
common-law principle at the founding precluded retrial following a
trial in an improper venue or before an improper jury.

															Early American practice provides further
confirmation that violations of the Venue and Vicinage Clauses do
not exempt defendants from retrial. Cf. Ramos, 590
U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6); District of Columbia v.
Heller, 554 U.S.
570, 605 (2008); Crawford v. Washington,
541 U.S.
36, 49–50 (2004). Perhaps most relevant here, this Court
embraced the retrial rule for a venue error in United States
v. Jackalow, 1 Black 484 (1862). In that case, the defendant
had been convicted in New Jersey for a crime committed on a ship
located off the coast of New York and Connecticut. Because the
crime occurred outside of New Jersey, trial in that State was
proper under the Venue and Vicinage Clauses only if the crime was
committed outside the limits of any State. See supra,
at 4, n. 3. And because the jury’s special verdict on
the issue of venue did not establish that fact, the Court directed
the lower court “to set aside the special verdict, and grant
a new trial.” Jackalow, 1 Black, at 488.

															This decision did not break new ground. Decades
earlier, Justice Story had concluded that “there are cases
where there may be a new trial; as in cases of a mis-trial by an
improper jury,” United States v. Gibert, 25 F.
Cas. 1287, 1302 (No. 15,204) (CC Mass. 1834) (citing
Arundel’s Case), and Justice Iredell had found it
“unnecessary” to consider a vicinage objection because
a new trial was warranted on other grounds, United States v.
Fries, 3 Dall. 515, 518 (CC Pa. 1799). Other federal
decisions ordered retrials for venue violations, see United
States v. Plympton, 27 F. Cas. 578 (No. 16,057) (CC DC
1833), or otherwise accepted that a retrial would be sufficient to
cure such an error, see, e.g., United States v.
Keen, 26 F. Cas. 686, 690 (No. 15,510) (CC Ind. 1839)
(“It is laid down in all the authorities, that if the court
have not jurisdiction . . . or the jury have not been
legally summoned, the defendant, though tried, cannot be considered
as having been in jeopardy”). State courts had likewise begun
reaching similar conclusions, notwithstanding the existence of
venue and vicinage clauses in their State Constitutions.[14] Given these developments, it is
not surprising that American treatises from this period agreed with
their English counterparts regarding the availability of
retrial.[15]

															Far from justifying an exemption from the
retrial rule, the historical background of the Venue and Vicinage
Clauses supports the opposite inference. We have found—and
Smith points to—no decision barring retrial based on a
successful venue or vicinage objection in either the centuries of
common law predating the founding or in the early years of practice
following ratification. This absence alone is considerable evidence
that the Clauses do not bar retrial of their own force. See,
e.g., Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S.
___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 12). Moreover, courts affirmatively
allowed retrial following trials in an improper venue or before
improperly constituted juries. All told, we have no reason to doubt
that the retrial rule applies.[16]

															III

															Smith argues that even if the Venue and
Vicinage Clauses do not bar retrial of their own force, they are
“inseparably interwoven” with the Double Jeopardy
Clause, which, he claims, precludes retrial here. Tr. of Oral Arg.
23; see Brief for Petitioner 38–39, 44. Smith starts from the
premise that juries in criminal trials often resolve factual
disputes related to venue and, thus, can acquit defendants if venue
is absent. And because a jury’s general verdict of acquittal
categorically precludes retrial for the same offense under the
Double Jeopardy Clause, Smith contends that a judicial ruling that
venue was improper on a motion to acquit should have the same
result. The Eleventh Circuit rejected this argument and held that
the Double Jeopardy Clause “is not implicated by a retrial in
a proper venue.” 22 F. 4th, at 1244. We agree.

															A judicial decision on venue is fundamentally
different from a jury’s general verdict of acquittal. When a
jury returns a general verdict of not guilty, its decision
“cannot be upset by speculation or inquiry into such
matters” by courts. Dunn v. United States,
284 U.S.
390, 393–394 (1932); see United States v.
Powell, 469 U.S.
57, 66–67 (1984). To conclude otherwise would
impermissibly authorize judges to usurp the jury right. See
ibid.; cf. United States v. Martin Linen Supply
Co., 430 U.S.
564, 572–573 (1977). And because it is impossible for a
court to be certain about the ground for the verdict without
improperly delving into the jurors’ deliberations, the jury
holds an “ ‘unreviewable power . . . to
return a verdict of not guilty’ ” even
“ ‘for impermissible reasons.’ ”
Powell, 469 U. S., at 63, 66–67; see Dunn,
284 U. S., at 393–394.

															This rationale is consistent with the general
rule that “[c]ulpability . . . is the
touchstone” for determining whether retrial is permitted
under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Evans v. Michigan,
568 U.S.
313, 324 (2013). When a trial terminates with a finding that
the defendant’s “criminal culpability had not been
established,” retrial is prohibited. Burks, 437
U. S., at 10. This typically occurs with “ ‘a
resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements
of the offense charged.’ ” Smith v.
Massachusetts, 543 U.S.
462, 468 (2005); see, e.g., Martin Linen, 430
U. S., at 572. But it also extends to “essentially
factual defense[s]” that negate culpability by
“provid[ing] a legally adequate justification for otherwise
criminal acts.” United States v. Scott,
437 U.S.
82, 97–98 (1978); see Burks, 437 U. S., at 5,
10 (insanity defense).

															Conversely, retrial is permissible when a trial
terminates “on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or
innocence of the offence of which [the defendant] is
accused.” Scott, 437 U. S., at 99. For example,
the Double Jeopardy Clause is not triggered when a trial ends in
juror deadlock, see Blueford v. Arkansas, 566 U.S.
599, 610 (2012), or with a judgment dismissing charges because
of a procedural issue like preindictment delay, see Scott,
437 U. S., at 84. In these circumstances, the termination of
proceedings is perfectly consistent with the possibility that the
defendant is guilty of the charged offense.

															The reversal of a conviction based on a
violation of the Venue or Vicinage Clauses, even when styled as a
“judgment of acquittal” under Rule 29, plainly does not
resolve “the bottom-line question of ‘criminal
culpability.’ ” Evans, 568 U. S., at
324, n. 6; see also Martin Linen, 430 U. S., at
571 (“[W]hat constitutes an ‘acquittal’ is not to
be controlled by the form of the judge’s action”).
Instead, such a reversal is quintessentially a decision that
“the Government’s case against [the defendant] must
fail even though it might satisfy the trier of fact that he was
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.” Scott, 437
U. S., at 96. In this case, then, the Eleventh Circuit’s
decision that venue in the Northern District of Florida was
improper did not adjudicate Smith’s culpability. It thus does
not trigger the Double Jeopardy Clause.

															*  *  *

															For these reasons, the judgment of the Court
of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed.

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 The Government did not
cross-appeal the Eleventh Circuit’s decision that venue for
trade secrets theft was improper in the Northern District of
Florida. We thus express no opinion on that issue. See,
e.g., Burks v. United States, 437 U.S.
1, 5 (1978). We likewise do not resolve whether venue on that
charge would be proper in the Middle District of Florida, a
question that the Eleventh Circuit declined to address. See
Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S.
709, 718, n. 7 (2005) (“[W]e are a court of review,
not of first view”).

constitutional violation may not require retrial. See, e.g.,
