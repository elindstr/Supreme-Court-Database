															MAETTA VANCE, PETITIONER v. BALL STATE
UNIVERSITY

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the seventh circuit

															[June 24, 2013]

															

															     Justice Thomas,
concurring.

															     I continue to believe
that Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742
(1998) , and Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S. 775 (1998) ,
were wrongly decided. See ante, at 8. However, I join the opinion
because it provides the narrowest and most workable rule for when
an employer may be held vicariously liable for an employee’s
harassment.
