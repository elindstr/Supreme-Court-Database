															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															VIRGINIA, et al. v. DENNIS LeBLANC

															on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit

															No. 16–1177. Decided June 12, 2017

															

															Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the judgment.

															Graham v. Florida,

560 U. S. 48 (2010)
, as today’s per curiam recognizes, established that a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide offense must have “some meaningful opportunity to obtain release [from prison] based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.”  Id., at 75.  See ante, at 2.  I join the Court’s judgment on the understanding that the Virginia Supreme Court, in Angel v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 248, 704 S. E. 2d 386 (2011), interpreted Virginia law to require the parole board to provide such a meaningful opportunity under the geriatric release program.  See id., at 275, 704 S. E. 2d, at 402 (“the factors used in the normal parole consideration process apply to conditional release decisions under this statute”).  In other words, contrary to the Fourth Circuit’s interpretation of Virginia law, the parole board may not deny a juvenile offender geriatric release “for any reason whatsoever,” 841 F. 3d 256, 269 (2016) (emphasis in original); instead, the board, when evaluating a juvenile offender for geriatric release, must consider the normal parole factors, including rehabilitation and maturity.  See ante, at 4.
