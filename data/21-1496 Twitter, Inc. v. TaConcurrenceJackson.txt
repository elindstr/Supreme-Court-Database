															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–1496

															_________________

															Twitter, Inc., PETITIONER v. Mehier
Taamneh, et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[May 18, 2023]

															

															Justice Jackson, concurring.

															I join the opinion of the Court with the
understanding that today’s decisions are narrow in important
respects. In this case and its companion, Gonzalez v.
Google, 598 U. S. ___ (2023) (per curiam),
the Court has applied 18 U. S. C. §2333(d)(2) to two
closely related complaints, filed by the same counsel. Both cases
came to this Court at the motion-to-dismiss stage, with no factual
record. And the Court’s view of the facts—including its
characterizations of the social-media platforms and algorithms at
issue—properly rests on the particular allegations in those
complaints. Other cases presenting different allegations and
different records may lead to different conclusions.

															The Court also draws on general principles of
tort and criminal law to inform its understanding of
§2333(d)(2). General principles are not, however, universal.
The common-law propositions this Court identifies in interpreting
§2333(d)(2) do not necessarily translate to other
contexts.
