															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															DIVNA MASLENJAK, PETITIONER v.

															UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[June 22, 2017]

															Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment.

															We granted review in this case to decide whether “a naturalized American citizen can be stripped of her citizenship in a criminal proceeding based on an immaterial false statement.”  Pet. for Cert. i.  The answer to that question is “no.”  Although the relevant criminal statute,

18 U. S. C. §1425(a), does not expressly refer to the concept of materiality, the critical statutory language effectively requires proof of materiality in a case involving false statements.  The statute makes it a crime for a person to “procure” naturalization “contrary to law.”  In false statement cases, then, the statute essentially imposes the familiar materiality requirement that applies in other contexts.  That is, a person violates the statute by procuring naturalization through an illegal false statement which has a “natural tendency to influence” the outcome—that is, the obtaining of naturalization.  Kungys v. United States,

485 U. S. 759,
772 (1988)
.

															Understood in this way, Section 1425(a) does not require proof that a false statement actually had some effect on the naturalization decision.  The operative statutory language—“procure” naturalization “contrary to law”—imposes no such requirement.

															Here is an example.  Eight co-workers jointly buy two season tickets to see their favorite football team play.  They all write their names on a piece of paper and place the slips in a hat to see who will get the tickets for the big game with their team’s traditional rival.  One of the friends puts his name in twice, and his name is drawn.  I would say that he “procured” the tickets “contrary to” the rules of the drawing even though he might have won if he had put his name in only once.

															Here is another example.  A runner who holds the world’s record in an event wants to make sure she wins the gold medal at the Olympics, so she takes a performance enhancing drug.  She wins the race but fails a drug test and is disqualified.  The second-place time is slow, and sportswriters speculate that she would have won without taking the drug.  But it would be entirely consistent with standard English usage for the race officials to say that she “procured” her first-place finish “contrary to” the governing rules.

															As these examples illustrate—and others could be added—the language of

18 U. S. C. §1425(a) does not require that an illegal false statement have a demonstrable effect on the naturalization decision.  Instead, the statute applies when a person makes an illegal false statement to obtain naturalization, and that false statement is material to the outcome.  I see no indication that Congress meant to require more.

															One additional point is worth mentioning.  Section 1425(a) not only makes it a crime to procure naturalization contrary to law; it applies equally to any person who “attempts to procure, contrary to law . . . . naturalization.”  Therefore, if a defendant knowingly performs a substantial act that he or she thinks will procure naturalization, that is sufficient for conviction.  See United States v. Resendiz-Ponce,

549 U. S. 102
–108 (2007).
