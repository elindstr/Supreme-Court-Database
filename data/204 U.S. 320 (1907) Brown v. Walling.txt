															 within two miles of the dwelling house of defendant in error and upon the government lands around his premises.  The defense, set up by demurrer, was, as in Bacon v. Walker, ante, p.  204 U. S. 311, that those sections were void under the due process and equality clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  The trial court rendered judgment for the defendant in error, which was affirmed by the District Court for Elmore County and by the supreme court of the state.  9 Idaho 740.

															The case was argued with Bacon v. Walker, and, on the authority of that case, the judgment is

															Affirmed.

															MR. JUSTICE BREWER and MR. JUSTICE PECKHAM dissent.
