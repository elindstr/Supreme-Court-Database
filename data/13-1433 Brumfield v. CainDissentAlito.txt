															KEVAN BRUMFIELD, PETITIONER v.BURL CAIN, WARDEN

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 18, 2015]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting.

															I join all but Part I–C of Justice Thomas’ dissent.  The story recounted in that Part is inspiring and will serve a very beneficial purpose if widely read, but I do not want to suggest that it is essential to the legal analysis in this case.
