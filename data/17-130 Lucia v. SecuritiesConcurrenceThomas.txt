															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															RAYMOND J. LUCIA, et al., PETITIONERS v. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit

															[June 21, 2018]

															

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring.

															I agree with the Court that this case is indistinguishable from Freytag v. Commissioner,

501 U. S. 868 (1991).  If the special trial judges in Freytag were “Officers of the United States,” Art. II, §2, cl. 2, then so are the administrative law judges of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Moving forward, however, this Court will not be able to decide every Appointments Clause case by comparing it to Freytag.  And, as the Court acknowledges, our precedents in this area do not provide much guidance.  See ante, at 6.  While precedents like Freytag discuss what is sufficient to make someone an officer of the United States, our precedents have never clearly defined what is necessary.  I would resolve that question based on the original public meaning of “Officers of the United States.”  To the Founders, this term encompassed all federal civil officials “ ‘with responsibility for an ongoing statutory duty.’ ”  NLRB v. SW General, Inc., 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4); Mascott, Who Are “Officers of the United States”? 70 Stan. L. Rev. 443, 564 (2018) (Mascott).[1]

															The Appointments Clause provides the exclusive process for appointing “Officers of the United States.”  See SW General, supra, at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 1).  While principal officers must be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, Congress can authorize the appointment of “inferior Officers” by “the President alone,” “the Courts of Law,” or “the Heads of Departments.”  Art. II, §2, cl. 2.

															This alternative process for appointing inferior officers strikes a balance between efficiency and accountability.  Given the sheer number of inferior officers, it would be too burdensome to require each of them to run the gauntlet of Senate confirmation.  See United States v. Germaine,

99 U. S. 508, 509–510 (1879); 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 627–628 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).  But, by specifying only a limited number of actors who can appoint inferior officers without Senate confirmation, the Appointments Clause maintains clear lines of accountability—encouraging good appointments and giving the public someone to blame for bad ones.  See The Federalist No. 76, p. 455 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton); Wilson, Lectures on Law: Government, in 1 The Works of James Wilson 343, 359–361 (J. Andrews ed., 1896).

															The Founders likely understood the term “Officers of the United States” to encompass all federal civil officials who perform an ongoing, statutory duty—no matter how important or significant the duty.  See Mascott 454.  “Officers of the United States” was probably not a term of art that the Constitution used to signify some special type of official.  Based on how the Founders used it and similar terms, the phrase “of the United States” was merely a synonym for “federal,” and the word “Office[r]” carried its ordinary meaning.  See id., at 471–479.  The ordinary meaning of “officer” was anyone who performed a continuous public duty.  See id., at 484–507; e.g., United States v. Maurice, 26 F. Cas. 1211, 1214 (No. 15,747) (CC Va. 1823) (defining officer as someone in “ ‘a public charge or employment’ ” who performed a “continuing” duty); 8 Annals of Cong. 2304–2305 (1799) (statement of Rep. Harper) (explaining that the word officer “is derived from the Latin word officium” and “includes all persons holding posts which require the performance of some public duty”).  For federal officers, that duty is “established by Law”—that is, by statute.  Art. II, §2, cl. 2.  The Founders considered individuals to be officers even if they performed only ministerial statutory duties—including recordkeepers, clerks, and tidewaiters (individuals who watched goods land at a customhouse).  See Mascott 484–507.  Early congressional practice reflected this understanding.  With exceptions not relevant here,[2] Congress required all fed- eral officials with ongoing statutory duties to be appointed in compliance with the Appointments Clause.  See id., at 507–545.

															Applying the original meaning here, the administrative law judges of the Securities and Exchange Commission easily qualify as “Officers of the United States.”  These judges exercise many of the agency’s statutory duties, including issuing initial decisions in adversarial proceedings.  See

15 U. S. C. §78d–1(a); 17 CFR §§200.14, 200.30–9 (2017).  As explained, the importance or significance of these statutory duties is irrelevant.  All that matters is that the judges are continuously responsible for performing them.

															In short, the administrative law judges of the Securities Exchange Commission are “Officers of the United States” under the original meaning of the Appointments Clause.  They have “ ‘responsibility for an ongoing statutory duty,’ ” which is sufficient to resolve this case.  SW General, 580 U. S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 4).  Because the Court reaches the same conclusion by correctly applying Freytag, I join its opinion.
Notes
1
 I address only the dividing line between “Officers of the United States,” who are subject to the Appointments Clause, and nonofficer employees, who are not.  I express no view on the meaning of “Office” or “Officer” in any other provision of the Constitution, or the difference between principal officers and inferior officers under the Appointments Clause. 

2
 The First Congress exempted certain officials with ongoing statu-tory duties, such as deputies and military officers, from the requirementsof the Appointments Clause.  But these narrow exceptions do not disprove the rule, as background principles of founding-era law explain each of them.  See Mascott 480–483, 515–530.
