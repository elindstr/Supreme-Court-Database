															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 13â€“975

															_________________

															T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC, PETITIONER v.CITY OF ROSWELL,
GEORGIA

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the eleventh circuit

															[January 14, 2015]

															Justice Alito, concurring.

															I concur in the Courtâ€™s opinion because I
agree that Congress, by using the term
â€œsubstantial evidence,â€ intended to
invoke administrative law principles. One such principle, as the
Court explains, is the requirement that agencies give reasons. I
write separately, however, because three other traditional
administrative law principles may also apply.

															First, a court must â€œuphold a decision of
less than ideal clarity if the agencyâ€™s path
may reasonably be discerned.â€ Bowman Transp.,
Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.,419 U. S.
281,286 (1974). In the context of47
U.Â S.Â C. Â§332(c)(7), which
leaves in place almost the entirety of a local
governmentâ€™s authority, a succinct statement
that a permit has been denied because the tower would be
esthetically incompatible with the surrounding area should suffice.
Nothing in this statute imposes an opinion-writing requirement.

															Second, even if a locality has erred, a court must not
invalidate the localityâ€™s decision if the error
was harmless. â€œIn administrative law, as in
federal civil and criminal litigation, there is a harmless error
rule.â€ National Assn. of Home Builders v.
Defenders of Wildlife,551 U.Â S.
644â€“660 (2007) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Here, for instance, I have trouble believing that
T-Mobile South, LLCâ€”which actively participated
in the decisionmaking process, including going so far as to
transcribe the public hearingâ€”was prejudiced by
the city of Roswellâ€™s delay in providing a copy
of the minutes.

															Third, the ordinary rule in administrative law is that a court
must remand errors to the agency â€œexcept in rare
circumstances.â€ Florida Power & Light Co.
v. Lorion,470 U.Â S. 729,744 (1985). Nothing we
say today should be read to suggest that when a locality has erred,
the inevitable remedy is that a tower must be built. The Court has
not passed on what remedial powers a â€œcourt of
competent jurisdictionâ€ may exercise.
Â§332(c)(7)(B)(v). This unanswered question is important
given the federalism implications of this statute.

															I do not understand the Courtâ€™s opinion to
disagree with this analysis. On that understanding, I join the
Courtâ€™s opinion.
