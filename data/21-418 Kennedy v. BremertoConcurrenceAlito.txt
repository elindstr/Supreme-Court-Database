															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–418

															_________________

															JOSEPH A. KENNEDY, PETITIONER v.
BREMERTON SCHOOL DISTRICT

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[June 27, 2022]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring.

															The expression at issue in this case is unlike
that in any of our prior cases involving the free-speech rights of
public employees. Petitioner’s expression occurred while at
work but during a time when a brief lull in his duties apparently
gave him a few free moments to engage in private activities. When
he engaged in this expression, he acted in a purely private
capacity. The Court does not decide what standard applies to such
expression under the Free Speech Clause but holds only that
retaliation for this expression cannot be justified based on any of
the standards discussed. On that understanding, I join the opinion
in full.
