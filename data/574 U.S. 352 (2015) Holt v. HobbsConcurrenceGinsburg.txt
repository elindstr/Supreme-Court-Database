															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 13â€“6827

															_________________

															GREGORY HOUSTON HOLT, aka ABDUL MAALIK MUHAMMAD, PETITIONER
v. RAY HOBBS, DIRECTOR, ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION,
etÂ al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the eighth circuit

															[January 20, 2015]

															Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Sotomayor joins,
concurring.

															Unlike the exemption this Court approved in Burwell v.
Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U. S. ___ (2014),
accommodating petitionerâ€™s religious belief in
this case would not detrimentally affect others who do not share
petitionerâ€™s belief. See id., at ___,
___â€“___, and n.Â 8, ___ (slip op.,
at 2, 7â€“8, and n.Â 8, 27) (Ginsburg,
J., dissenting). On that understanding, I join the
Courtâ€™s opinion.
