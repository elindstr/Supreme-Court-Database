															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 15–1293

															_________________

															JOSEPH MATAL, INTERIM DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES
PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, PETITIONER v. SIMON SHIAO
TAM

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[June 19, 2017]

															Justice Thomas, concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment.

															I join the opinion of Justice Alito, except for
Part II. Respondent failed to present his statutory argument either
to the Patent and Trademark Office or to the Court of Appeals, and
we declined respondent’s invitation to grant certiorari on
this question. Ante, at 9. I see no reason to address this
legal question in the first instance. See Star Athletica, L. L.
C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U. S. ___, ___
(2017) (slip op., at 6).

															I also write separately because “I
continue to believe that when the government seeks to restrict
truthful speech in order to suppress the ideas it conveys, strict
scrutiny is appropriate, whether or not the speech in question may
be characterized as ‘commercial.’ ”
Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525,
572 (2001) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment); see also, e.g., 44 Liquormart, Inc. v.
Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 518 (1996) (same). I
nonetheless join Part IV of Justice Alito’s opinion because
it correctly concludes that the disparagement clause, 15
U. S. C. §1052(a), is unconstitutional even under
the less stringent test announced in Central Hudson Gas &
Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y.,
447 U. S. 557 (1980) .
