U.S. Supreme Court ROGERS v. CLARK IRON CO, 217 U.S. 589 (1910) Â 217 U.S. 589  DAVID MUNRO ROGERS et al., Infants, etc., Plaintiffs in Error, v. CLARK IRON COMPANY et al.  No. 244.  Supreme Court of the United States  April 11, 1910  Mr. John B. Richards for plaintiffs in error.  Messrs. John G. Williams, Joseph B. Cotton, William R. Begg, and Frank B. Kellogg for defendants in error.  Per Curiam:  Writ of Error dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The case is reported below in 104 Minn. 198, 116 N.W. 739, where the facts are set forth at length. We hold that no Federal question was decided either by express terms or by necessary implication, and that the attempt to raise a Federal question was made in this court for the first time, which was too late.
