PETITIONERS v. BRANDON W. OWENS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the tenth circuit

															[December 15, 2014]

															Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Kagan
join, and with whom Justice Thomas joins as to all but the final
sentence, dissenting.

															When Dart removed this class action to federal court, it was
required to file a â€œnotice of
removalâ€ containing â€œa short and
plain statement of the grounds for removal.â€28
U.Â S.Â C. Â§1446(a). In
accordance with what it thought to be Tenth Circuit jurisprudence,
the District Court interpreted this to require evidence (as opposed
to mere allegations) supporting federal jurisdiction. After finding
that Dartâ€™s notice of removal did not include
evidence of the jurisdictionally required amount in controversy,
the District Court remanded the case to state court. App. to Pet.
for Cert. 25aâ€“28a. Dart sought permission to
appeal this order under Â§1453(c)(1), which provides
that â€œa court of appeals may accept an
appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a
motion to remand a class action to the State court from which it
was removedâ€ (emphasis added). Without stating its
reasons, the Tenth Circuit issued an order denying
Dartâ€™s request. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a.

															Eager to correct what we suspected was the District
Courtâ€™s (and the Tenth
Circuitâ€™s) erroneous interpretation of
Â§1446(a), we granted certiorari to decide whether
no-tices of removal must contain evidence supporting federal
jurisdiction. After briefing we discovered a little snag: This case
does not present that question. Because we are reviewing the
Tenth Circuitâ€™s judgment, the only
question before us is whether the Tenth Circuit abused its
discretion in denying Dart permission to appeal the District
Courtâ€™s remand order. Once we found out that
the issue presented differed from the issue we granted certiorari
to review, the responsible course would have been to confess error
and to dismiss the case as improvidently granted.

															The Court, however, insists on deciding whether the District
Court erred in remanding this case to state court. How can it do
that, one might ask, when the only issue in this case concerns the
propriety of the Tenth Circuitâ€™s rejection of
Dartâ€™s appeal? The Court hits upon a solution:
It concludes that the Tenth Circuit decided not to hear the appeal
because it agreed with the District Courtâ€™s
analysis. Attributing the District Courtâ€™s
reasoning to the Tenth Circuit allows the Court to pretend to
review the appellate courtâ€™s exercise of
discretion while actually reviewing the trial
courtâ€™s legal analysis.

															There are problems with this approach that are, in a rational
world, insuperable. To begin with, the Tenth
Circuitâ€™s short order does not tell us why it
decided not to hear Dartâ€™s appeal. It
might have done so for an impermissible
reasonâ€”for example, agreement with the District
Courtâ€™s legal reasoning. But it might instead
have done so for countless other, permissible,
reasonsâ€”for example, a concern that this would
be a poor vehicle for deciding the issue presented by
Dartâ€™s appeal, or a concern regarding the
courtâ€™s ability to quickly resolve the issue,
see Â§1453(c)(2)â€“(3) (providing that
appeals accepted under Â§1453(c)(1) must be decided
within 60 days, absent consent of the parties, with a 10-day
extension for â€œgood cause shown and in the
interests of justiceâ€).

															Not long ago we held, unanimously, that â€œ[a]n
appellate court should not presume that a district court intended
an incorrect legal result when the order is equally susceptible of
a correct reading, particularly when the applicable standard of
review is deferential.â€ Sprint/United Management
Co. v. Mendelsohn,552 U.Â S. 379,386 (2008).
There, we corrected the Tenth Circuit for doing precisely what the
Court itself does today in reviewing (deferen-tially) the Tenth
Circuitâ€™s denial of permission to appeal:
presuming that the lower court adopted a legally erroneous argument
advanced by one party. Id., at 384â€“385.
We explained to the Tenth Circuit that â€œit would
be inappropriate for the reviewing court to assume, absent
indication in the District Courtâ€™s
opinion, that the lower court adopted a
partyâ€™s incorrect argument.â€
Id., at 385, n.Â 2 (empha-sis added). Today,
however, this Court blatantly violates that rule.

															The only â€œindication in the
opinionâ€ that the Court relies on is the following
language from the order denying permission to appeal:
â€œUpon careful consideration of [1] the
partiesâ€™ submissions, as well as [2] the
applicable law, the Petition [for permission to appeal the remand
order] is denied.â€ App. to Pet. for Cert.
13aâ€“14a. This, the Court tells us, means the
Tenth Circuit must have denied Dartâ€™s
petition because it agreed with the District
Courtâ€™s legal conclusion. Of course it
means no such thing.

															As for point [1], considering a submission is not the
same thing as agreeing with that submission. Worse still,
correctness of the District Courtâ€™s opinion was
not the only ground that Owensâ€™ brief in the
Tenth Circuit urged to support denial of the petition for review.
It noted, for example, that the case addressed the general removal
statute, Â§1446(a), and so did not involve a question
unique to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA). Response to
Petition for Permission to Appeal in No.
13â€“603, p.Â 3. (The Tenth Circuit
considers â€œthe presence of an important
CAFA-related questionâ€ a reason to accept an appeal.
BP America, Inc. v. Oklahoma ex rel. Edmonson, 613 F.
3d 1029, 1034 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).)

															As for point [2], there is no reason whatever to believe that
the only â€œapplicable lawâ€ the Tenth
Circuit considered and relied on was the law relating to the
correctness of the District Courtâ€™s
decisionâ€”i.e., the law interpreting
Â§1446(a). After all, the â€œapplicable
lawâ€ surely includes the law applicable to the
disposition of petitions to appeal, Â§1453(c)(1), and
that body of law includes countless reasons to deny permission to
appeal that are unrelated to the merits of the underlying district
court judgment. â€œApplicable lawâ€
would allow the Tenth Circuit, for example, to deny permission to
appeal for reasons not mentioned in the
partiesâ€™ briefing. It would allow it to deny
permission because it would be unable to resolve the issue within
60 days, as required by CAFA (absent an extension).
Â§1453(c)(2) and (c)(3); see also 730 F.Â 3d
1234, 1238 (Hartz, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)
(â€œIt will always be tempting for very busy
judges to deny review of a knotty matter that requires a decision
in short orderâ€). And â€œapplicable
lawâ€ would permit numerous other grounds for denial,
including those applied by this Court in denying petitions for
certiorari. There is, to tell the truth, absolutely nothing in the
Tenth Circuitâ€™s order to suggest that it relied
on the unlawful ground that the Court eagerly attributes to it,
rather than one of many possible lawful grounds. Thus, as we said
in Mendelsohn, â€œit would be inappropriate
for the reviewing court [us] to assume
.Â .Â . that the lower court adopted a
partyâ€™s incorrect argument.â€ 552
U. S., at 385, n.Â 2.

															Besides relying on the utterly uninformative language of the
order, the Court makes one other attempt to demonstrate that the
Tenth Circuitâ€™s order was based upon its
agreement with the holding of the District Court. It asserts that
denying Dart permission to appeal â€œfroz[e] in
placeâ€ the District Courtâ€™s rule.
Ante, at 10. In light of that denial, the Court says, any
â€œresponsible attorneyâ€ will include
evidence supporting jurisdiction in his notice of removal, thereby
eliminating the risk of having that notice held improper for the
reason given by the District Court in this case. As a result, the
Tenth Circuit will likely never again be presented with the
question whether evidence of jurisdiction must be included with a
notice of removal. Ibid. The Court then notes that, among
the many factors the Tenth Circuit considers in deciding whether to
accept an appeal under Â§1453(c)(1), is whether the case
presents an issue which, if not resolved in that appeal, will
â€œleave the ambit of the federal courts for
good.â€ BP America, supra, at 1035. One
would have thought that this factor, if it controlled the Tenth
Circuitâ€™s denial, means that the Tenth Circuit
did not agree with the Courtâ€™s
perception that this issue will not likely reappear. The Court,
how-ever, says (quite illogically) that it means the TenthCircuit
must have agreed with the District
Courtâ€™s incorrect legal analysis. It is hard to
imagine a more obvious non sequitur.

															And the argument not only tortures logic, it also distorts
reality, resting as it does on the premise that henceforth no
â€œresponsible attorneyâ€ will fail to
include evidence supporting federal jurisdiction in a notice of
removal. Even discounting the existence of irresponsible attorneys,
but see, e.g., Maples v. Thomas, 565
U.Â S. ___ (2012), responsible attorneys, and even
responsible judges, sometimes make mistakes, see, e.g., 572
U.Â S. ___ (2014) (order granting certiorari in this
case). Indeed, Dartâ€™s own (seemingly
responsible) lawyers failed to include evidence supporting federal
jurisdiction, despite what they argue is Circuit precedent
supporting the District Courtâ€™s holding. See
Tr. of Oral Arg. 12 (counsel for Dart, explaining that the District
Courtâ€™s ruling was supported by Tenth Circuit
precedent).

															Even in the legal utopia imagined by the
Courtâ€”a world in which all lawyers are
responsible and no lawyers make mistakesâ€”it is
easy to imagine ways in which the issue could come back to the
circuit court. If, for example, a party appealed a district court
decision addressing the sufficiency of the jurisdictional evidence,
the Tenth Circuit could accept the appeal and hold (en banc, if
necessary) that no evidence is required at all. In short, it is
impos-sible to credit the suggestion (irrelevant in any case) that
the chances of this issue arising again were
â€œslim.â€ Ante, at 10.

															The Court attempts to bolster its conclusion with an
unprincipled and unequal application of the waiver doctrine. Owens,
it says, by failing to brief the argument that the Tenth Circuit
denied Dartâ€™s petition for reasons other than
its agreement with the District Courtâ€™s
decision, waived that argument. Ante, at 12 (citing this
Courtâ€™s Rule 15.2). Dart, however, never made
an argument that would have called for such a response. It never
argued that the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion in denying
permission to appeal. Aside from one stray assertion on the final
page of its reply brief, its briefing focused entirely on whether
the District Court erred in remanding the case to state
court. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners 9
(â€œThis Court should reverse the district
courtâ€™s order remanding the case to state
courtâ€). Rather than hold Dart responsible for failing
to argue that the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion, see
Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital,Ltd., 573
U.Â S. ___, ___, n.Â 2 (2014) (slip op., at
5, n.Â 2) (â€œWe will not revive a
forfeited argument simply because the petitioner gestures toward it
in its reply briefâ€), theCourt makes the argument on
Dartâ€™s behalf and then takes Owens to task for
failing to refute it. This Court ought not embrace such an
oddhanded application of waiver principles.

															The Court answers that Dart â€œhad no cause to
addressâ€ whether the Tenth Circuit abused its
discretion until the issue was raised in Public
Citizenâ€™s amicus brief. Ante, at
9, n. 3. Not good enough. First, parties always have
â€œcause to addressâ€ issues on which
their entitlement to relief depends. Second, and more important,
Public Citizen filed its amicus brief after both
sides had already filed their merits briefs. So if the timing
of that brief excuses Dartâ€™s failure to address
whether the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion, it should excuse
Owensâ€™ failure as well.

															I come, finally, to the Courtâ€™s stinging
observation that I joined the majority opinion in Standard Fire
Ins. Co. v. Knowles, 568 U.Â S. ___
(2013)â€”a case that arose in the same posture as
this one, but that was resolved without reference to the question
whether the appellate court abused its discretion. Ante, at
8, n. 2. Of course Knowles did not address whether denials
of permission to appeal under Â§1453(c)(1) are to be
reviewed for abuse of discretionâ€”which is why
todayâ€™s majority cannot cite it as precedent.
See Brecht v. Abrahamson,507 U.Â S.
619â€“631 (1993). As for my own culpability in
overlooking the issue, I must accept that and will take it with me
to the grave. But its irrelevance to my vote in the present case
has been well expressed by Justice Jackson, in a passage quoted by
the author of todayâ€™s opinion:
â€œI see no reason why I should be consciously
wrong today because I was unconsciously wrong
yesterday.â€ Massachusetts v. United
States,333 U.Â S. 611â€“640 (1948)
(dissenting opinion), quoted in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby
Stores, Inc., 573 U.Â S. ___, ___, n.Â 11
(2014) (slip op., at 12, n. 11) (Ginsburg J., dissenting).

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															Instead of correcting an erroneous district court opinion at the
expense of an erroneous Supreme Court opinion, I would have
dismissed this case as improvidently granted. Failing that, my vote
is to affirm the Court of Appeals, since we have absolutely no
basis for concluding that it abused its discretion.
