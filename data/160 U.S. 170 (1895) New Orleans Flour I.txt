APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA
Syllabus 
Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651, affirmed to the point that when, pending an appeal from the judgment of a lower court, and without any fault of the defendant, an event occurs which renders it impossible for the appellate court, if it should decide the case in favor of the plaintiff, to grant him any effectual relief, the court will not proceed to a formal judgment, but will dismiss the appeal.

															THE CHIEF JUSTICE.  The decree below enjoined appellants from enforcing against appellees Act No. 71 of the Extra Session of the General Assembly of Louisiana of 1870 (Laws La.Ex.Sess. 1870, p. 156).  This act was repealed June 28, 1892 (No. 23 of 1892, Acts La. 1892, 34), and the appeal is dismissed on the authority of Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651.

															Appeal dismissed.
