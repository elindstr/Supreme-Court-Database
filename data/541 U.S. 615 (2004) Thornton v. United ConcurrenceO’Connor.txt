SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 03-5165

															MARCUS THORNTON, PETITIONER v. UNITED
STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the fourth circuit

															[May 24, 2004]

															   Justice O’Connor,
concurring in part.

															   I join all but footnote 4 of the
Court’s opinion. Although the opinion is a logical extension
of the holding of New York v.
Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981), I
write separately to express my dissatisfaction with the state of
the law in this area. As Justice Scalia forcefully argues,
post, p. 2-5 (opinion concurring in judgment), lower
court decisions seem now to treat the ability to search a vehicle
incident to the arrest of a recent occupant as a police entitlement
rather than as an exception justified by the twin rationales of
Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969).
That erosion is a direct consequence of Belton’s
shaky foundation. While the approach Justice Scalia proposes
appears to be built on firmer ground, I am reluctant to adopt it in
the context of a case in which neither the Government nor the
petitioner has had a chance to speak to its merit.
