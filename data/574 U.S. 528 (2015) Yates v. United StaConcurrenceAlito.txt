															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															JOHN L. YATES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the eleventh circuit

															[February 25, 2015]

															Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment.

															This case can and should be resolved on narrow grounds. And
though the question is close, traditional tools of statutory
construction confirm that John Yates has the better of the
argument. Three features of18 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§1519 stand out to me: the
statuteâ€™s list of nouns, its list of verbs, and
its title. Although perhaps none of these features by itself would
tip the case in favor of Yates, the three combined do so.

															Start with the nouns. Section 1519 refers to
â€œany record, document, or tangible
object.â€ The noscitur a sociis canon instructs
that when a statute contains a list, each word in that list
presumptively has a â€œsimilarâ€
meaning. See, e.g., Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.,513
U.Â S. 561,576 (1995). A related canon, ejusdem
generis teaches that general words following a list of specific
words should usually be read in light of those specific words to
mean something â€œsimilar.â€ See,
e.g., Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567
U.Â S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 18). Applying these
canons to Â§1519â€™s list of nouns,
the term â€œtangible objectâ€ should
refer to something similar to records or documents. A fish does not
spring to mindâ€”nor does an antelope, a colonial
farmhouse, a hydrofoil, or an oil derrick. All are
â€œobjectsâ€ that are
â€œtangible.â€ But who
wouldnâ€™t raise an eyebrow if a neighbor, when
asked to identify something similar to a
â€œrecordâ€ or
â€œdocument,â€ said
â€œcrocodileâ€?

															This reading, of course, has its shortcomings. For instance,
this is an imperfect ejusdem generis case because
â€œrecordâ€ and
â€œdocumentâ€ are themselves quite
general. And there is a risk that â€œtangible
objectâ€ may be made
superfluousâ€”what is similar to a
â€œrecordâ€ or
â€œdocumentâ€ but yet is not one? An
e-mail, however, could be such a thing. See United States
Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual Â§2J1.2 and
comment. (Nov. 2003) (reading â€œrecords,
documents, or tangible objectsâ€ to
â€œinclud[e]â€ what is found on
â€œmagnetic, optical, digital, other electronic,or
other storage mediums or devicesâ€). An e-mail,
afterall, might not be a â€œdocumentâ€
if, as was â€œtraditionallyâ€ so, a
document was a â€œpiece of paper with information
on it,â€ not â€œinformation stored on
a computer, electronic storage device, or any other
medium.â€ Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary
587â€“588 (10th ed. 2014). E-mails might also not
be â€œrecordsâ€ if records are limited
to â€œminutesâ€ or other formal
writings â€œdesigned to memorialize [past]
events.â€ Id., at 1465. A hard drive, however,
is tangible and can contain files that are precisely akin to even
these narrow definitions. Both
â€œrecordâ€ and
â€œdocumentâ€ can be read more
expansively, but adding â€œtangible
objectâ€ to Â§1519 would ensure beyond
question that electronic files are included. To be sure,
â€œtangible objectâ€ presumably can
capture more than just e-mails; Congress enacts
â€œcatchall[s]â€ for
â€œknown unknowns.â€ Republic of
Iraq v. Beaty,556 U.Â S. 848,860 (2009). But
where noscitur a sociis and ejusdem generis apply,
â€œknown unknownsâ€ should be similar
to known knowns, i.e., here, records and documents. This is
especially true because reading â€œtangible
objectâ€ too broadly could render
â€œrecordâ€ and
â€œdocumentâ€ superfluous.

															Next, consider Â§1519â€™s list of
verbs: â€œalters, destroys, mutilates, conceals,
covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in.â€
Although many of those verbs could apply to nouns as far-flung as
salamanders, satellites, or sand dunes, the last phrase in the
listâ€”â€œmakes a false entry
inâ€â€”makes no sense outside of
filekeeping. How does one make a false entry in a fish?
â€œAltersâ€ and especially
â€œfalsifiesâ€ are also closely
associated with filekeeping. Not one of the verbs, moreover,
cannot be applied to
filekeepingâ€”certainly not in the way that
â€œmakes a false entry inâ€ is always
inconsistent with the aquatic.

															Again, the Government is not without a response. One can imagine
Congress trying to write a law so broadly that not every verb lines
up with every noun. But failure to â€œline
upâ€ may suggest that something has gone awry in
oneâ€™s interpretation of a text. Where, as here,
each of a statuteâ€™s verbs applies to a certain
category of nouns, there is some reason to think that Congress had
that category in mind. Categories, of course, are often
underinclusive or
overinclusiveâ€”Â§1519, for instance,
applies to a bomb-threatening letter but not a bomb. But this does
not mean that categories are not useful or that Congress does not
enact them. See, e.g., Vance v. Bradley,440
U.Â S. 93â€“109 (1979). Here, focusing
on the verbs, the category of nouns appears to be filekeeping. This
observation is not dispositive, but neither is it nothing. The
Government also contends that
Â§1519â€™s verbs cut both ways because
it is unnatural to apply
â€œfalsifiesâ€ to tangible objects,
and that is certainly true. One does not falsify the outside casing
of a hard drive, but one could falsify or alter data physically
recorded on that hard drive.

															Finally, my analysis is influenced by
Â§1519â€™s title:
â€œDestruction, alteration, or falsification of
records in Federal investigations and
bankruptcy.â€ (Emphasis added.) This too points toward
filekeeping, not fish. Titles can be useful devices to resolve
â€œÂ â€˜doubt about
the meaning of a
statute.â€™Â â€
Porter v. Nussle,534 U.Â S.
516â€“528 (2002) (quoting
Almendarez-Torres v. United States,523
U.Â S. 224,234 (1998)); see also Lawson v. FMR
LLC, 571 U.Â S. ___, ___â€“___
(2014) (Sotomayor,Â J., dissenting) (slip op., at
4â€“6). The title is especially valuable here
because it reinforces what the textâ€™s nouns and
verbs independently suggestâ€”that no matter how
other statutes might be read, this particular one does not cover
every noun in the universe with tangible form.

															Titles, of course, are also not dispositive. Here, if the list
of nouns did not already suggest that â€œtangible
objectâ€ should mean something similar to records or
documents, especially when read in conjunction with
Â§1519â€™s peculiar list of verbs with
their focus on filekeeping, then the title would not be enough on
its own. In conjunction with those other two textual features,
however, the Governmentâ€™s argument, though
colorable, becomes too implausible to accept. See, e.g.,
Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v.
Guardianship Estate of Keffeler,537 U.Â S.
371â€“385 (2003) (focusing on the
â€œproduct of [two] canons of
constructionâ€ which was
â€œconfirmedâ€ by other interpretative
evidence); cf. Al-Adahi v. Obama, 613
F.Â 3d 1102, 1105â€“1106 (CADC 2010)
(aggregating evidence).
