SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 09-223

															RICHARD A. LEVIN, TAX COMMISSIONER OF OHIO,
PETITIONER v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the sixth circuit

															[June 1, 2010]

															   Justice Alito, concurring in the
judgment.

															   I agree with the Court that
principles of comity bar the present action. I am doubtful about
the Court’s efforts to distinguish Hibbs v.
Winn, 542 U.
S. 88 (2004), but whether today’s holding undermines
Hibbs’ foundations is a question that can be left
for another day.
