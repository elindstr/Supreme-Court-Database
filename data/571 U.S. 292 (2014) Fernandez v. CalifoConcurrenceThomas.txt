															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															WALTER FERNANDEZ, PETITIONER v. CALIFORNIA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal
of california for the second appellate district

															[February 25, 2014]

															

															     Justice Thomas,
concurring.

															     I join the opinion of
the Court, which faithfully applies Georgia v. Randolph, 547
U. S. 103 (2006) . I write separately to make clear the extent
of my disagreement with Randolph.

															     I dissented in Randolph
because the facts of that case did not implicate a Fourth Amendment
search and never should have been analyzed as such. Id., at 145
(Thomas, J., dissenting) (“[N]o Fourth Amendment search
occurs where . . . the spouse of an accused voluntarily
leads the police to potential evidence of wrongdoing by the
accused”). Instead of deciding the case on that narrow
ground, the majority in Randolph looked to “widely shared
social expectations” to resolve whether the wife’s
consent to a search should control over her husband’s
objection. Id., at 111. I find no support for that novel analytical
approach in the Fourth Amendment’s text or history, or in
this Court’s jurisprudence. See id., at 128–131
(Roberts, C. J., dissenting). Accordingly, given a blank slate, I
would analyze this case consistent with The Chief Justice’s
dissent in Randolph: “A warrantless search is reasonable if
police obtain the voluntary consent of a person authorized to give
it.” Id., at 128. That is because “[c]o-occupants have
‘assumed the risk that one of their number might permit [a]
common area to be searched.’ ” Ibid. (quoting
United States v. Matlock, 415 U. S. 164 , n. 7 (1974)).
In this case, the trial court found that Rojas’ consent was
voluntary, see ante, at n. 2, and petitioner does not contest
that Rojas had common authority over the premises. That should be
the end of the matter.
