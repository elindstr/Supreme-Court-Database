															UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. MAURICE LAMONT DAVIS AND ANDRE LEVON GLOVER

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 24, 2019]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Alito join, and with whom The Chief Justice joins as to all but Part II–C, dissenting.

															Crime and firearms form a dangerous mix.  From the 1960s through the 1980s, violent gun crime was rampant in America.  The wave of violence destroyed lives and devastated communities, particularly in America’s cities.  Between 1963 and 1968, annual murders with firearms rose by a staggering 87 percent, and annual aggravated assaults with firearms increased by more than 230 percent.

															Faced with an onslaught of violent gun crime and its debilitating effects, the American people demanded action.  In 1968, Congress passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed the Gun Control Act.  That law made it a separate federal crime to use or carry a firearm during a federal felony.  Despite that and other efforts, violent crime with firearms continued at extraordinarily dangerous levels.  In 1984 and again in 1986, in legislation signed by President Reagan, Congress reenacted that provision of the 1968 Act, with amendments.  The law now prohibits, among other things, using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a federal “crime of violence.”

18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A).  The law mandates substantial prison time for violators.

															Over the last 33 years, tens of thousands of §924(c) cases have been prosecuted in the federal courts.  Meanwhile, violent crime with firearms has decreased significantly.  Over the last 25 years, the annual rate of murders with firearms has dropped by about 50 percent, and the annual rate of nonfatal violent crimes (robberies, aggravated assaults, and sex crimes) with firearms has decreased by about 75 percent.  Violent crime in general (committed with or without a firearm) has also declined.  During that same time period, both the annual rate of overall violent crime and the annual rate of murders have dropped by almost 50 percent.

															Although the level of violent crime in America is still very high, especially in certain cities, Americans under the age of 40 probably cannot fully appreciate how much safer most American cities and towns are now than they were in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.  Many factors have contributed to the decline of violent crime in America.  But one cannot dismiss the effects of state and federal laws that impose steep punishments on those who commit violent crimes with firearms.

															Yet today, after 33 years and tens of thousands of federal prosecutions, the Court suddenly finds a key provision of §924(c) to be unconstitutional because it is supposedly too vague.  That is a surprising conclusion for the Court to reach about a federal law that has been applied so often for so long with so little problem.  The Court’s decision today will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes in the future.  The Court’s decision also will likely mean that thousands of inmates who committed violent gun crimes will be released far earlier than Congress specified when enacting §924(c).  The inmates who will be released early are not nonviolent offenders.  They are not drug offenders.  They are offenders who committed violent crimes with firearms, often brutally violent crimes.

															A decision to strike down a 33-year-old, often-prosecuted federal criminal law because it is all of a sudden unconstitutionally vague is an extraordinary event in this Court.  The Constitution’s separation of powers authorizes this Court to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional.  That is an awesome power.  We exercise that power of judicial review in justiciable cases to, among other things, ensure that Congress acts within constitutional limits and abides by the separation of powers.  But when we overstep our role in the name of enforcing limits on Congress, we do not uphold the separation of powers, we transgress the separation of powers.

															I fully understand how the Court has arrived at its conclusion given the Court’s recent precedents in Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S. ___ (2015), and Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U. S. ___ (2018).  But this case presents an entirely different question.  Those cases involved statutes that imposed additional penalties based on prior convictions.  This case involves a statute that focuses on the defendant’s current conduct during the charged crime.  The statute here operates entirely in the present.  Under our precedents, this statute therefore is not unconstitutionally vague.  It is a serious mistake, in my respectful view, to follow Johnson and Dimaya off the constitutional cliff in this case.  I respectfully dissent.[1]

															I

															Section 924(c) prohibits using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a federal “crime of violence,” or possessing a firearm in furtherance of a federal “crime of violence.”[2]  Section 924(c) is a substantive criminal offense, not a sentence enhancement.  The Government therefore charges a §924(c) offense in the indictment.  Ordinarily, when charged under §924(c), a defendant will be charged with both an underlying federal crime and then also a §924(c) offense.  For example, Davis was charged with both conspiracy to commit robbery and a §924(c) offense.  Glover was likewise charged with both conspiracy to commit robbery and a §924(c) offense.

															By any measure, Davis and Glover’s conduct during the conspiracy was violent.  Davis and Glover committed multiple armed robberies of convenience stores in the early morning hours.  Those armed robberies followed a pattern: Davis and Glover (or Glover and a co-conspirator)—usually covering their faces—would arrive at a convenience store in the early morning hours in a car with no plates.  One of them would point a short-barreled shotgun at a female employee and order her around.  Sometimes, he would point the short-barreled shotgun in her face.  Sometimes, he would put the short-barreled shotgun in her side.  While one of them was aiming the short-barreled shotgun at the store employee, another would take cigarettes and demand money.  Davis and Glover’s crime spree ended with still more dangerous behavior: a high-speed car chase in wet and dangerous driving conditions that culminated in a crash.

															Section 924(c)(3) lays out the definition of “crime of violence” for purposes of §924(c).  That definition has two prongs, either of which can bring a defendant within the scope of §924(c).[3]

															The first prong of §924(c)(3) is the elements prong.  That prong, the Government concedes here, asks whether the underlying crime categorically fits within §924(c) because of the elements of the crime.  The judge makes that determination.  If the answer is yes, then the judge instructs the jury on the §924(c) offense to simply find whether the defendant used or carried a firearm during and in relation to that underlying crime, or possessed a firearm in furtherance of that underlying crime.

															The Fifth Circuit concluded that Davis and Glover’s conspiracy offenses did not fit within the elements prong of §924(c)(3).  So the question was whether Davis and Glover were covered by the second prong.

															The second prong of §924(c)(3) is the substantial-risk prong.  That prong covers cases beyond those covered by the first prong, the elements prong.  Congress sensibly wanted to cover defendants who committed crimes that are not necessarily violent by definition under the elements prong, but who committed crimes with firearms in a way that created a substantial risk that violent force would be used.  To that end, the substantial-risk prong, properly read, focuses not on the elements of the underlying crime, but rather on the defendant’s conduct during that crime.  If a defendant used or carried a firearm during and in relation to the crime, and the defendant’s conduct during the crime created a substantial risk that physical force may be used, then the defendant may be guilty of a §924(c) offense.  In that instance, the jury makes the finding: Did the defendant’s conduct during the underlying crime create a substantial risk that violent force would be used?

															In other words, as relevant here, a defendant can fall within the scope of §924(c) either (1) because of the elements of the underlying crime or (2) because of the defendant’s conduct in committing the underlying crime.  Either (1) the judge finds that an element of the underlying crime entails the use of physical force or (2) the jury finds that the defendant’s actual conduct involved a substantial risk that physical force may be used.  Put another way, the underlying crime itself may automatically bring the defendant within the scope of §924(c).  Or if the underlying crime does not automatically qualify as a crime of violence, then the defendant’s conduct during the crime may still bring the defendant within the scope of §924(c).  Sensible enough.

															The basic question in this case is whether the substantial-risk prong of §924(c)(3)’s definition of “crime of violence” is unconstitutionally vague.  It is not.

															As this Court has explained multiple times, criminal laws that apply a risk standard to a defendant’s conduct are not too vague, but instead are perfectly constitutional.  Writing for the Court in Johnson, for example, Justice Scalia stated that “we do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as ‘substantial risk’ to real-world  conduct.”  576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  The following year in Welch v. United States, Justice Kennedy confirmed that Johnson “cast no doubt on the many laws that ‘require gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages on a particular occasion.’ ”  578 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op., at 3–4) (quoting Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12)).  Two years later in Dimaya, Justice Kagan wrote for the Court and echoed Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy: “In Johnson’s words, ‘we do not doubt’ the constitutionality of applying §16(b)’s ‘substantial risk [standard] to real-world conduct.’ ”  584 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11) (quoting Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12)).

															That kind of risk-based criminal statute is not only constitutional, it is very common.  As the Court has recognized, “dozens of federal and state criminal laws use terms like ‘substantial risk,’ ‘grave risk,’ and ‘unreasonable risk,’ ” and almost all of those statutes “require gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages on a particular occasion.”  Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  Indeed, the Government’s brief in Johnson collected more than 200 state and federal statutes that imposed criminal penalties for conduct that created a risk of injury to others.  App. to Supp. Brief for United States in Johnson v. United States, O. T. 2014, No. 13–7120, pp. 1a–99a.

															Take a few examples from federal law: It is a federal crime to create “a substantial risk of harm to human life” while illegally “manufacturing a controlled substance.”

21 U. S. C. §858 (emphasis added).  Under certain circumstances, it is a federal crime to create “a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to any other person by destroying or damaging any structure, conveyance, or other real or personal property within the United States or by attempting or conspiring to” do so.

18 U. S. C. §2332b(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added).  And for purposes of the chapter of the federal criminal code dealing with sexual abuse crimes, “serious bodily injury” is defined as “bodily injury that involves a substantial risk of death, unconsciousness, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental faculty.”  §2246(4) (emphasis added).

															The States’ criminal codes are similar.  Among the crimes that the States define by using qualitative risk standards are resisting arrest,[4] kidnaping,[5] assault,[6] battery,[7] criminal recklessness,[8] endangerment,[9] unlawful restraint,[10] theft,[11] hazing,[12] abuse,[13] neglect,[14] arson,[15] homicide,[16] and weapons offenses.[17]

															Consider a few specific examples: In Pennsylvania, a person resists arrest “if, with the intent of preventing a public servant from effecting a lawful arrest or discharging any other duty, the person creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to the public servant or anyone else.”  18 Pa. Cons. Stat. §5104 (2015) (emphasis added).  In Tennessee, kidnaping is defined as false imprisonment “under circumstances exposing the other person to substantial risk of bodily injury.”  Tenn. Code Ann. §39–13–303(a) (2018) (emphasis added).  In New York, reckless endangerment occurs when a person “recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person.”  N. Y. Penal Law Ann. §120.20 (emphasis added).  And in Maryland, neglect of a minor is defined as “the intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs or mental health of a minor that creates a substantial risk of harm to the minor’s physical health or a substantial risk of mental injury to the minor.”  Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §3–602.1(a)(5)(i) (2012) (emphasis added).

															The above examples demonstrate that substantial-risk standards like the one in §924(c)(3)(B) are a traditional and common feature of criminal statutes.  As the Eleventh Circuit succinctly stated, there “is nothing remarkable about asking jurors to make that sort of risk determination—and, if necessary, requiring judges to instruct jurors on the meaning of terms like ‘substantial’ and ‘physical force.’ ”  Ovalles v. United States, 905 F.3d 1231, 1250, n. 8 (2018) (en banc).  That is “exactly how similar questions have been resolved for centuries and are resolved every day in courts throughout the country.”  Ibid.

															A statute is unconstitutionally vague only if “it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes,” or is “so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.”  Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  Section 924(c)(3)(B) is not unconstitutionally vague.  To reiterate, §924(c)(3)(B) defines “crime of violence” as “an offense that is a felony and . . . that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.”  Section 924(c)(3)(B) affords people of ordinary intelligence ample notice that they may be punished if they carry or use a gun while engaging in criminal conduct that presents a risk that physical force may be used.  There “is a whole range of conduct that anyone with at least a semblance of common sense would know” is covered by §924(c)(3)(B).  Chicago v. Morales,

527 U.S. 41, 114 (1999) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, and juries are well equipped to enforce and defend §924(c)(3)(B) prosecutions in a principled and predictable way—just as they have for decades with many other substantial-risk criminal statutes.  As Judge Niemeyer wrote in his separate opinion in the Fourth Circuit, “the parties in those cases had little difficulty understanding, enforcing, or defending the §924(c)(1) charges at issue.”  United States v. Simms, 914 F.3d 229, 264 (2019).[18]

															In short, §924(c)(3)(B) is a garden-variety, substantial-risk criminal law.  Section 924(c)(3)(B) is not unconstitutionally vague.

															II

															This case therefore should be straightforward.  But the Court complicates things by engaging in a two-step dance that ends with the Court concluding that §924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutionally vague.

															The Court’s first step is to construe §924(c)(3)’s substantial-risk prong to require an ordinary-case categorical approach rather than a conduct-specific approach.  In other words, the Court says that a defendant’s guilt or innocence under §924(c)(3)’s substantial-risk prong hinges on a judge’s assessment of how a hypothetical defendant would ordinarily commit the underlying crime.  In the Court’s view, a defendant’s guilt or innocence under §924(c)(3)’s substantial-risk prong does not depend on a jury’s finding about how the actual defendant actually committed the underlying crime.

															The Court’s second step is based on the Court’s decisions in Johnson and Dimaya.  The Court says that the ordinary-case categorical approach makes §924(c)(3)(B) unconstitutionally vague.

															For purposes of this case, the Court’s error is its first step—that is, in construing the substantial-risk prong of §924(c)(3) to require an ordinary-case categorical approach.  For three reasons, I disagree with the Court’s analysis.  First, the Court’s justifications in Johnson and Dimaya for adopting the categorical approach do not apply in the context of §924(c).  Second, the text of §924(c)(3)(B) is best read to focus on the actual defendant’s actual conduct during the underlying crime, not on a hypothetical defendant’s imagined conduct during an ordinary case of the underlying crime.  Third, even if the text were ambiguous, the constitutional avoidance canon requires that we interpret the statute to focus on the actual defendant’s actual conduct.

															I will address those three points in Parts II–A, II–B, and II–C.

															A

															According to the Court, if §924(c)(3)(B) focused on the defendant’s conduct during the underlying crime, then it would not be unconstitutionally vague.  But §924(c)(3)(B), as the Court reads it, focuses on a hypothetical defendant’s conduct during an ordinary case of the underlying crime.  As a result, the Court says that §924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutionally vague.

															But it makes little sense, as I see it, to say that §924(c)(3)(B)’s substantial-risk inquiry focuses on whether a hypothetical defendant’s imagined conduct during an ordinary case of the crime creates a substantial risk that physical force may be used, rather than on whether the actual defendant’s actual conduct during the actual crime created a substantial risk that physical force may be used.  Why would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes current-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual defendant?  As Judge Newsom cogently wrote for the Eleventh Circuit en banc majority, “If you were to ask John Q. Public whether a particular crime posed a substantial risk of violence, surely he would respond, ‘Well, tell me how it went down—what happened?’ ”  Ovalles, 905 F. 3d, at 1241.[19]

															Why does the Court read the substantial-risk prong in such an unnatural way?  The Court explains that Johnson interpreted similar substantial-risk language to require the ordinary-case categorical approach.  See 576 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 12–13).  A plurality of the Court did the same in Dimaya.  See 584 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 12–15).  And the Court today casts this case as the third installment in a trilogy with a predictable ending, one that was supposedly foreordained by Johnson and Dimaya.

															The gaping hole in the Court’s analysis, in my view, is that Johnson and Dimaya addressed statutes that imposed penalties based on a defendant’s prior criminal convictions.

															In Johnson, the Court interpreted a definition of “violent felony” that was used in sentencing proceedings to classify prior convictions as predicates for stricter sentences.  See §§924(e)(1), (e)(2)(B).  In Dimaya, the Court interpreted a definition of “crime of violence” that was used in immigration proceedings to classify prior convictions as predicates for more severe immigration consequences.  See §16 (defining “crime of violence”);

8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(F) (incorporating

18 U. S. C. §16);

8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (deportation); §§1229b(a)(3), (b)(1)(C) (ineligibility for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status).

															In interpreting those statutes, the Court employed the ordinary-case categorical approach to assess an individual’s past convictions.  And application of that categorical approach, the Court then said, rendered the statutes at issue in those cases unconstitutionally vague.  See Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–11); Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 5–6).[20]

															Two important principles drove the Court’s adoption of the categorical approach in the prior-conviction context in Johnson and Dimaya.

															First, in the prior-conviction cases, the Court emphasized that the categorical approach avoids the difficulties and inequities of relitigating “past convictions in minitrials conducted long after the fact.”  Moncrieffe v. Holder,

569 U.S. 184, 200–201 (2013).  Without the categorical approach, courts would have to determine the underlying conduct from years-old or even decades-old documents with varying levels of factual detail.  See Taylor v. United States,

495 U.S. 575, 601–602 (1990).  The factual statements that are contained in those documents are often “prone to error.”  Mathis v. United States, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 10).  The categorical approach avoids the unfairness of allowing inaccuracies to “come back to haunt the defendant many years down the road.”  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  The Court has echoed that reasoning time and again.  See, e.g., Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 15); Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13); Descamps v. United States,

570 U.S. 254, 270 (2013); Chambers v. United States,

555 U.S. 122, 125 (2009).

															Second, in the prior-conviction cases, the Court insisted on the categorical approach to avoid “
 
Sixth Amendment concerns.”  Descamps, 570 U. S., at 269.  The
 
Sixth Amendment, as interpreted by this Court’s precedents, does not allow a judge (rather than a jury) to make factual determinations that increase the maximum penalty.  See Apprendi v. New Jersey,

530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000).  The Court has read its
 
Sixth Amendment precedents to require the categorical approach.  Under the categorical approach, the judge looks only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.  The Court has reiterated those
 
Sixth Amendment concerns in countless categorical-approach cases.  See, e.g., Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13); Mathis, 579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 10); Shepard v. United States,

544 U.S. 13, 24–25 (2005) (plurality opinion); Taylor, 495 U. S., at 601.

															In short, the Court in Johnson and Dimaya employed something akin to the constitutional avoidance doctrine to read the statutes at issue to avoid practical and
 
Sixth Amendment problems.  In the words of Justice Thomas, the “categorical approach was never really about the best reading of the text.”  Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___ (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 28).  As Judge Raggi has perceptively stated: “[C]onstitutional avoidance informed the original categorical-approach mandate.”  United States v. Barrett, 903 F.3d 166, 179 (CA2 2018).

															But neither of the two reasons identified in Johnson and Dimaya applies to

18 U. S. C. §924(c)(3)(B)—not even a little.

															First, §924(c) does not require examination of old conduct underlying a prior conviction.  Section 924(c) operates entirely in the present.  In a §924(c) prosecution, there are ordinarily two charged crimes: the underlying crime and the §924(c) offense.  Here, for example, the defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and with the §924(c) offense.  The defendant’s conduct during the underlying crime is part of the §924(c) offense.  The conduct charged in the §924(c) offense is in front of the jury (if the case goes to trial) or accepted by the defendant in the plea agreement (if the defendant pleads guilty).  The indictment must allege specific offense conduct, and that conduct must be proved with real-world facts in order to obtain a conviction.  There is no need to worry about stale evidence or unavailable witnesses.  Nor is there any need to worry about inaccuracies in years-old or decades-old documents coming back to haunt the defendant.

															Second, §924(c) likewise raises no
 
Sixth Amendment concerns.  A jury will find the facts or, if the case ends in a guilty plea, the defendant will accept the facts in the plea agreement.  For the §924(c) charge, as relevant here, a jury must find that the defendant’s conduct “by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.”  The defendant has the opportunity to contest the relevant facts either at the trial or in plea negotiations.  No
 
Sixth Amendment issue arises in a §924(c) prosecution.

															No practical or
 
Sixth Amendment problems exist with §924(c)(3)(B).  Indeed, the Court itself acknowledges that “a case-specific approach wouldn’t yield the same practical and
 
Sixth Amendment complications” that arose in Johnson and Dimaya.  Ante, at 8.

															We should recognize that Johnson and Dimaya dealt with an entirely different context: prior convictions.  There is no need to follow Johnson and Dimaya off the cliff here.  We should read §924(c)(3)(B) like the dozens of other substantial-risk statutes in federal and state criminal law: to focus on the actual defendant’s actual conduct during the actual underlying crime, not on a hypothetical defendant’s imagined conduct during an ordinary case of that crime.

															B

															Now to the statutory text of §924(c)(3)(B).  Even though the context here is current-offense conduct, not past convictions, the Court says that the statutory language nonetheless compels a focus on a hypothetical defendant’s imagined conduct, not on the actual defendant’s actual conduct.  I disagree.  Criminal defendants are usually punished based on what they actually did, not based on what a hypothetical defendant might have done.

															To begin with, the text of §924(c)(3)(B) must be interpreted against the backdrop of traditional criminal-law practice.  As described above, substantial-risk statutes are commonplace in federal and state criminal law.  Those statutes ordinarily call for examination of the actual defendant’s actual conduct during the actual crime.  The Court does not identify a single self-contained federal or state law that defines the actus reus of the crime based on the imagination of the judge about a hypothetical defendant, rather than on the evidence before the jury about the actual defendant.

															This Court applied an exception in Johnson and Dimaya for substantial-risk statutes that impose sentencing and other penalties based on past convictions.  But that is an exception for past convictions, not a rule for current-offense conduct.  Section 924(c)(3)(B) must be read in line with the traditional, common practice of focusing on the actual defendant’s actual conduct during the underlying crime.

															With that background, I turn to the precise text of §924(c)(3).  To repeat, the text of §924(c)(3) provides: A defendant may not use or carry a firearm during and in relation to, or possess a firearm in furtherance of, “an offense that is a felony and” that either (A) “has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,” or (B) “by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.”

															I will focus on four particular aspects of the statutory text of §924(c)(3)(B).

															First, start with the term “offense.”  Section 924(c)(3) has two prongs under which a defendant might qualify for a §924(c) conviction: first, if the underlying crime automatically qualifies as a crime of violence based on its elements; and, second, if the defendant’s conduct during the underlying crime created a substantial risk that physical force may be used, even if the underlying crime by its elements does not constitute a crime of violence.

															The term “offense” applies to both prongs.  In the elements prong, the term refers to the elements of the underlying crime.  In the substantial-risk prong, the term refers to the defendant’s conduct during the underlying crime.  That is entirely commonplace and sensible.

															Reading “offense” in that commonsense way follows from the Court’s precedents interpreting the term “offense.”  As the Court has explained many times, the term “offense” may “sometimes refer to a generic crime” and may “sometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged on a specific occasion.”  Nijhawan v. Holder,

557 U.S. 29, 33–34 (2009).[21]  Indeed, the single term “offense” can refer to both in the same statutory scheme.  See, e.g., id., at 40; id., at 38 (listing other examples); United States v. Hayes,

555 U.S. 415, 421–422 (2009).

															In United States v. Hayes, for example, the Court interpreted the term “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.”  That term was defined as “an offense” that (1) “has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,” and (2) was “committed by” a person who has a particular relationship with the victim.  §921(a)(33)(A).  The Court interpreted the “offense that . . . has, as an element” language in that provision to focus on the legal prohibition, and interpreted the “offense . . . committed by” language to focus on the defendant’s conduct.  See Hayes, 555 U. S., at 421–422.  In other words, the term “offense” was used once but had two different meanings as applied to the two different parts of the statutory provision.

															Another example is the Immigration and Nationality Act.  That statute defines “aggravated felony” in part as “an offense” (1) that “involves fraud or deceit” and (2) “in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.”  8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i).  The Court interpreted the “offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit” language to focus on the legal prohibition.  See Kawashima v. Holder,

565 U.S. 478, 483 (2012).  And the Court interpreted the “offense . . . in which the loss” language to focus on the individual’s conduct.  See Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at 40.  Again, the term “offense” was used once, but had two different meanings as applied to the two different parts of the statutory provision.

															Section 924(c)(3) is the same kind of statutory provision.  It likewise encompasses both the legal prohibition (in subpart (A)) and the defendant’s actual conduct (in subpart (B)).  The term “offense” was read in Hayes, Kawashima, and Nijhawan to encompass both the legal prohibition and the defendant’s conduct.  The term should be read that same way here.

															Moreover, if the substantial-risk prong of §924(c)(3) requires assessing a hypothetical defendant’s conduct rather than the actual defendant’s conduct, then there would be little daylight between the elements prong and the substantial-risk prong.  After all, a crime is defined by its elements.  The elements tell you what happens in an ordinary case of a crime.  To imagine how a hypothetical defendant would have committed an ordinary case of the crime, you would presumably look back to the elements of the crime.  But doing that under the substantial-risk prong—as the Court would do—would just duplicate the inquiry that already occurs under the elements prong.  That would defeat Congress’ purpose in adding the substantial-risk prong to §924(c)(3)—namely, covering defendants who committed crimes that are not violent by definition but that are committed by particular defendants in ways that create a risk of violence.  There is no reason to think that Congress meant to duplicate the elements prong in the substantial-risk prong.[22]

															The Court usually tries to avoid an interpretation of a statutory provision that would make the provision redundant and accomplish virtually nothing.  See, e.g., Republic of Sudan v. Harrison, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 10); Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.,

539 U.S. 23, 35 (2003); Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc.,

486 U.S. 825, 837 (1988); A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 174–179 (2012); W. Eskridge, Interpreting Law: A Primer on How to Read Statutes and the Constitution 112–114 (2016).  We should heed that principle here, and recognize that the term “offense” in the substantial-risk prong refers to the actual defendant’s conduct during the underlying crime.

															In short, the term “offense” in §924(c)(3), as applied to the substantial-risk prong, focuses on the actual defendant’s actual conduct, not on a hypothetical defendant’s imagined conduct.

															Second, §924(c)(3)(B) asks whether the defendant’s offense “by its nature” involves a risk that physical force may be used.  In a vacuum, the “nature” of an offense could be either “the metaphysical ‘nature’ of the offense” or “the underlying facts of the offense.”  Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 24).  But that is because the term “offense” could refer to a legal prohibition or to the defendant’s actual conduct.  As explained above, however, the term “offense” as applied to the substantial-risk prong refers to the actual defendant’s con- duct during the underlying crime.  It follows that “by its na- ture” focuses on the nature of the actual defendant’s conduct during the crime.  The phrase “by its nature” is linked to the term “offense.”  If the term “offense” refers to the defendant’s actual conduct, then “by its nature” also focuses on the defendant’s actual conduct.

															Under the conduct-specific approach to the substantial-risk prong, the “by its nature” language simply means that the Government has to show more than a defendant’s proclivity for crime and more than the mere fact that the defendant was carrying a gun.  The Government has to show that the defendant’s conduct by its nature during the crime created a substantial risk that physical force may be used.

															In short, as Justice Thomas has pointed out, it “is entirely natural to use words like ‘nature’ and ‘offense’ to refer to an offender’s actual underlying conduct.”  Ibid.  So it is here.

															Third, §924(c)(3)(B) asks whether the defendant’s conduct “involves” a substantial risk that physical force may be used.  In Taylor v. United States, a case involving a prior-conviction statutory provision, the Court pointed to the absence of the word “involved” in adopting a categorical approach.  495 U. S., at 600.  And in Nijhawan v. Holder, another case involving a prior-conviction statutory provision, the Court explained that the word “involves” did not support a categorical approach.  557 U. S., at 36.  Here, unlike in Taylor, the statute does use the word “involves.”  Under Taylor’s reasoning, the inclusion of the word “involves” in §924(c)(3)(B) supports the conclusion that §924(c)(3)(B) employs a conduct-specific approach rather than a categorical approach.

															Fourth, §924(c)(3)(B)’s use of the phrase “in the course of committing the offense” indicates that the proper focus is on the actual defendant’s actual conduct, not on a hypothetical defendant’s imagined conduct.  After all, the underlying offense was committed by the actual defendant, not by a hypothetical defendant.  It strains common sense to think that the “in the course of committing the offense” language in §924(c)(3)(B) contemplates an inquiry into a hypothetical defendant’s conduct during an ordinary case of the crime.

															Importantly, the law at issue in Johnson did not have the “in the course of committing the offense” language.  §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  That is a major textual difference between the law in Johnson on the one hand and §924(c)(3)(B) on the other hand.  And that textual distinction further shows that §924(c)(3)(B) focuses on the actual defendant’s actual conduct.

															In short, those four textual indicators, while not all entirely one-sided, together strongly suggest that §924(c)(3)(B) focuses on the actual defendant’s actual conduct during the actual crime, not on a hypothetical defendant’s imagined conduct during an ordinary case of the crime.

															On top of all the language in the statute, §924(c)(3)(B) does not contain the critical term that ordinarily marks a categorical approach.

															Section 924(c)(3)(B) does not use the term “conviction.”  This Court has historically recognized the term “conviction” as a key textual driver of the categorical approach.  In cases such as Taylor and Johnson, the Court zeroed in on the word “convictions.”  See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13); Taylor, 495 U. S., at 600; see also Mathis, 579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); Moncrieffe, 569 U. S., at 191; Ovalles, 905 F. 3d, at 1245.  So too, the Court in Leocal v. Ashcroft emphasized that the text of the INA that incorporated §16(b) used the term “convicted.”

543 U.S. 1, 4, 7 (2004).[23]

															The term “conviction” is nowhere to be found in the text of §924(c)(3)(B).  That should not come as a surprise, given that §924(c)(3)(B) is a substantive criminal offense concerned with the defendant’s current-offense conduct.  The absence of the term “conviction” in §924(c)(3)(B) strongly supports a conduct-specific approach.

															Put simply, the textual clues—both the words that are used and the words that are not used—point strongly to the conclusion that §924(c)(3)(B) requires a jury to assess the actual defendant’s actual conduct during the underlying crime.  The conclusion becomes overwhelming when considered against the general background of substantial-risk statutes.  To be sure, a statute can always be written more clearly.  But here, the textual toolkit leads decisively to that conclusion.

															C

															But after all of that, suppose that you are not convinced.  Suppose that you think that this case is still a close call on the text, even with the background of substantial-risk statutes and the Court’s precedents.  Indeed, suppose you ultimately disagree with the above analysis of the text.  Even so, the Government still wins—unless it can be said that §924(c)(3)(B) unambiguously requires a categorical approach.  Under the constitutional avoidance canon, the precise question before us is not whether §924(c)(3)(B) is best read to require a conduct-specific approach, but rather (as the Court’s cases say) whether §924(c)(3)(B) can reasonably, plausibly, or fairly possibly be interpreted to require a conduct-specific approach.  The answer to that question is easy.  Yes.  See Hooper v. California,

155 U.S. 648, 657 (1895) (“reasonable”); Clark v. Martinez,

543 U.S. 371, 380 (2005) (“plausible”); Skilling v. United States,

561 U.S. 358, 406 (2010) (“fairly possible” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

															The Court says that if §924(c)(3)(B) requires the categorical approach, then it is unconstitutionally vague.  But the Court also says that if §924(c)(3)(B) focuses on the defendant’s actual conduct, then it is constitutionally permissible.  As the Court puts it, “a case-specific approach would avoid the vagueness problems that doomed the statutes in Johnson and Dimaya.”  Ante, at 8.  So the entire ball game is whether it is fairly possible to interpret §924(c)(3)(B) to require a conduct-specific approach.  It surely is at least fairly possible.

															It is an elementary principle of statutory interpretation that an ambiguous statute must be interpreted, whenever possible, to avoid unconstitutionality.  See generally Scalia, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, at 247–251; Eskridge, Interpreting Law: A Primer on How to Read Statutes and the Constitution, at 317–322.  That uncontroversial principle of statutory interpretation dates back to the Founding era.  See Mossman v. Higginson, 4 Dall. 12, 14 (1800).  As Justice Thomas has explained, the traditional doctrine of constitutional avoidance commands “courts, when faced with two plausible constructions of a statute—one constitutional and the other unconstitutional—to choose the constitutional reading.”  Clark, 543 U. S., at 395 (dissenting opinion).  This Court’s duty is “not to destroy the Act if we can, but to construe it, if consistent with the will of Congress, so as to comport with constitutional limitations.”  Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers,

413 U.S. 548, 571 (1973).  In discharging that duty, “every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.”  Hooper, 155 U. S., at 657.

															This Court’s longstanding practice of saving ambiguous statutes from unconstitutionality where fairly possible affords proper respect for the representative branches of our Government.  The Court has explained that “a presumption never ought to be indulged, that congress meant to exercise or usurp any unconstitutional authority, unless that conclusion is forced upon the Court by language altogether unambiguous.”  United States v. Coombs, 12 Pet. 72, 76 (1838).

															In countless cases for more than 200 years, this Court has recognized the principle that courts should construe ambiguous laws to be consistent with the Constitution.  See, e.g., McDonnell v. United States, 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op., at 23–24); Skilling, 561 U. S., at 405–409; Clark, 543 U. S., at 380–382; Edmond v. United States,

															To be clear, the case before us is not a case of avoiding possible unconstitutionality.  This is a case of avoiding actual unconstitutionality.  There is a debate about the former practice.  There is no real debate about the latter rule.  And it is the latter rule of statutory interpretation at issue here.

															Section 924(c)(3)(B) is best read to focus on the defendant’s actual conduct.  But at a minimum—given the text, the background of substantial-risk laws, and the relevant precedents—it is fairly possible to interpret §924(c)(3)(B) to focus on the defendant’s actual conduct.  Because that reasonable interpretation would save §924(c)(3)(B) from unconstitutionality, this case should be very straightforward, as Judge Newsom explained in his thorough majority opinion in the Eleventh Circuit and as Judge Niemeyer and Judge Richardson explained in their persuasive separate opinions in the Fourth Circuit.  Ovalles, 905 F. 3d, at 1251; Simms, 914 F. 3d, at 272 (opinion of Niemeyer, J.); id., at 272–277 (opinion of Richardson, J.).  We should prefer the constitutional reading over the unconstitutional reading.

															The Court did not apply constitutional avoidance in Johnson and Dimaya.  Why not?  In those two cases, the Court explained, the canon of constitutional avoidance was essentially rendered a nullity.  That is because, as the Court described the situation, the Court was between a rock and a hard place.  The categorical approach would have led to
 
Fifth Amendment vagueness concerns, whereas applying the conduct-specific approach would have led to
 
Sixth Amendment jury-trial concerns.  See Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___–___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13–14).

															Here, by contrast, the Court is not between a rock and a hard place.  Applying the categorical approach to §924(c)(3)(B) would lead to vagueness concerns, whereas applying the conduct-specific approach would lead to no constitutional concerns.

															Faced with a choice between a rock and constitutionality, the Court chooses the rock.  I do not understand that choice.

															The Court offers two related reasons for its choice to run the statute into a rock.  Neither reason holds up.

															First, the Court concludes that the constitutional avoidance canon must yield to the rule of lenity.  That argument disregards the Court’s oft-repeated statements that the rule of lenity is a tool of last resort that applies “only when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction,” grievous ambiguity remains.  Hayes, 555 U. S., at 429 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., Ocasio v. United States, 578 U. S. ___, ___, n. 8 (2016) (slip op., at 13, n. 8) (“after seizing everything from which aid can be derived” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Muscarello v. United States,

524 U.S. 125, 138 (1998) (same); United States v. Wells,

519 U.S. 482, 499 (1997) (same); Reno v. Koray,

515 U.S. 50, 65 (1995) (same); United States v. Shabani,

513 U.S. 10, 17 (1994) (“after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction”); Smith v. United States,

508 U.S. 223, 239 (1993) (“after seizing every thing from which aid can be derived” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); Moskal v. United States,

498 U.S. 103, 108 (1990) (“after resort to the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies of the statute” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Callanan v. United States,

364 U.S. 587, 596 (1961) (“at the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed”).

															The constitutional avoidance canon is a traditional canon of statutory interpretation.  The constitutional avoidance canon is employed to reach a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute.  Where, as here, that canon applies and yields such a reasonable interpretation, no grievous ambiguity remains.  The rule of lenity has no role to play.  Contrary to the Court’s assertion, the canon of constitutional avoidance is not “at war” with the rule of lenity.  Ante, at 19.  The canon of constitutional avoidance precedes the rule of lenity because the rule of lenity comes into play (this Court has said countless times) only “after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction.”  Hayes, 555 U. S., at 429 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  The rule of lenity “comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.”  Callanan, 364 U. S., at 596.

															In addition, the rule of lenity is triggered only in the face of “grievous ambiguity.”  Muscarello, 524 U. S., at 139 (internal quotation marks omitted).  To reiterate, §924(c)(3)(B) is best read to focus on the actual defendant’s actual conduct.  But to the extent that there is any ambiguity in §924(c)(3)(B), that ambiguity is far from grievous.

															Second, and relatedly, the Court claims that the canon of constitutional avoidance, as a general matter, cannot be relied upon to broaden the scope of a criminal statute, as opposed to narrowing the scope of a criminal statute.  And the Court says that the canon cannot be used here because, in the Court’s view, relying on the constitutional avoidance canon in this case would expand the scope of §924(c)(3)(B).  I disagree for two independent reasons.

															To begin with, that theory seems to come out of nowhere.  The Court’s novel cabining of the constitutional avoidance canon is not reflected in this Court’s precedents.  On the contrary, it contradicts several precedents.  This Court has applied the constitutional avoidance canon even when avoiding the constitutional problems would have broadened the statute’s scope.  For example, in United States v. Culbert, this Court rejected a narrowing construction of the Hobbs Act because that construction would have raised vagueness concerns.

435 U.S. 371, 374 (1978); see also United States v. Shreveport Grain & Elevator Co.,

287 U.S. 77, 82 (1932); cf. United States v. Grace,

461 U.S. 171, 176 (1983).

															Moreover, the premise of this novel broadening/ narrowing theory is flawed.  A categorical approach to §924(c)(3)(B) would not be inherently narrower than a conduct-specific approach.  Each approach would sweep in some crimes that the other would not.  On the one hand, some crimes that might be deemed categorically violent sometimes may be committed in nonviolent ways.  Those crimes would be covered by the categorical approach but not by a conduct-specific approach.  On the other hand, some categorically nonviolent crimes are committed in violent ways.  Those crimes would not be covered by the categorical approach but would be covered by a conduct-specific approach.  See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12).

															In sum, the constitutional avoidance canon makes this an especially straightforward case.  It is at least fairly possible to read §924(c)(3)(B) to focus on the actual defendant’s actual conduct during the actual crime.  End of case.

															III

															The consequences of the Court’s decision today will be severe.  By invalidating the substantial-risk prong of §924(c)(3), the Court’s decision will thwart Congress’ law enforcement policies, destabilize the criminal justice system, and undermine safety in American communities.  If the law required those results, we would have to swallow the consequences.  But the law, in my respectful view, does no such thing.

															The Court’s decision means that people who in the future commit violent crimes with firearms may be able to escape conviction under §924(c).  In enacting §924(c), Congress sought to keep firearms away from violent criminal situations.  Today, the Court invalidates a critical provision designed to achieve that goal.  To be sure, many violent crimes still might fall within §924(c)(3)’s elements clause.  But many others might not.  When defendants use firearms during conspiracies to commit robbery, arsons, attempted carjackings, and kidnapings, to name just a few, they might no longer be subject to prosecution under §924(c).  See, e.g., Simms, 914 F. 3d, at 233–234 (conspiracy to commit robbery); United States v. Salas, 889 F.3d 681, 683–684 (CA10 2018) (arson); United States v. Jenkins, 849 F.3d 390, 393 (CA7 2017) (kidnaping).

															To get a flavor of the offenders who will now potentially avoid conviction under §924(c), consider a sample of those offenders who have been convicted under §924(c)(3)’s substantial-risk prong:

															One defendant committed assault with intent to commit murder.  The defendant shot his wife multiple times while the couple was camping in Buffalo River National Park.  See United States v. Prickett, 839 F.3d 697, 698 (CA8 2016).

															One defendant committed arson.  The defendant used a molotov cocktail to firebomb the Irish Ink Tattoo Shop.  See Salas, 889 F. 3d, at 683; United States v. Salazar, 2014 WL 12788997, *1 (NM, Aug. 14, 2014).

															One defendant and others kidnaped a man who they believed had stolen money and an Xbox from the defendant.  They beat the man severely and threatened to kill him.  See Pet. for Cert. in United States v. Jenkins, O. T. 2017, No. 17–97, p. 2.

															One defendant committed conspiracy to commit robbery.  The defendant and his co-conspirators planned to steal Percocet and cash from a man they thought was a drug dealer.  Armed with a pistol and a crowbar, they broke into the man’s home by shattering a sliding glass door and found three men there.  One of the defendant’s co-conspirators attacked all three men with the crowbar, and the defendant threatened the men with a pistol multiple times.  See United States v. Douglas, 907 F.3d 1, 4–5 (CA1 2018).

															One defendant committed attempted carjacking.  Armed with guns and baseball bats, the defendant and her co-conspirators robbed a grocery store and carjacked two vehicles, pistol whipping the owner of one of the vehicles in the process.  They then attempted to carjack a third vehicle.  They approached a family getting out of a minivan and demanded the keys.  One of the defendant’s co-conspirators hit a 13-year-old girl in the mouth with a baseball bat.  Another shot an AK–47 at the girl’s family.  See Ovalles, 905 F. 3d, at 1235.

															One defendant operated multiple houses of prostitution in Annapolis.  The defendant threatened perceived competitors with violence.  He also beat and threatened women, sometimes to compel them to engage in prostitution.  See United States v. Fuertes, 805 F.3d 485, 490–492 (CA4 2015).

															One defendant committed conspiracy to commit robbery.  In the middle of the night, the defendant and a co-conspirator crawled into a McDonald’s through the drive-through window.  The defendant pointed a gun at the restaurant’s manager and attempted to hit another employee.  The defendant demanded money, and the manager complied.  The defendant then removed the money from the cash drawer, pistol whipped the manager, threw the cash drawer at the other employee, and fled the scene along with his co-conspirators and $1,100.  See Simms, 914 F. 3d, at 232.

															One defendant committed conspiracy to commit robbery.  The defendant and his co-conspirators committed a string of armed robberies of small businesses.  During the robberies, they wore masks and gloves.  They were armed with guns, knives, and baseball bats.  They injured several people during the course of their robberies, breaking bones, drawing blood, and knocking people out.  They also shot and killed one of their victims point blank.  See Barrett, 903 F. 3d, at 170, 184.

															Those real-life stories highlight a second unfortunate consequence of the Court’s decision.  Many offenders who have already committed violent crimes with firearms—and who have already been convicted under §924(c)—may be released early from prison.  The Court’s decision will apply to all defendants whose convictions are not yet final on direct review and who preserved the argument.  With the benefit of this Court’s decision, many dangerous offenders who received lengthy prison sentences as a result of their violent conduct might walk out of prison early.  And who knows whether the ruling will be retroactive?  Courts will be inundated with collateral-review petitions from some of the most dangerous federal offenders in America.  As Judge Niemeyer wrote in his separate opinion in the Fourth Circuit, “thousands of §924(c)(1) convictions will unnecessarily be challenged as premised on what the majority today concludes is an unconstitutionally vague provision, even though the parties in those cases had little difficulty understanding, enforcing, or defending the §924(c)(1) charges at issue.”  Simms, 914 F. 3d, at 264.

															Moreover, defendants who successfully challenge their §924(c) convictions will not merely be resentenced.  Rather, their §924(c) convictions will be thrown out altogether.  That is because, to restate an obvious point, §924(c) defines a substantive criminal offense.  To be sure, the §924(c) defendants may also be serving other sentences for other convictions (for instance, if they were convicted of and sentenced for the underlying crime of violence).  But with the benefit of the Court’s decision, they may be able to get their §924(c) convictions tossed and lop off years—potentially decades—from their total prison time.

															All because the Court thinks that §924(c)(3)(B) unambiguously compels a focus on the imagined conduct of a hypothetical defendant rather than on the actual conduct of the actual defendant.  That analysis is not persuasive, especially in light of the constitutional avoidance doctrine.  It is true that the Government once advocated for a categorical approach.  But in the early years after Congress added a “crime of violence” definition to §924(c), before courts settled on a categorical approach, the Government correctly argued for a conduct-specific approach to the substantial-risk prong.  See, e.g., United States v. Cruz, 805 F.2d 1464, 1469 (CA11 1986).  The Government later changed its tune only after the courts settled on a categorical approach—at a time when it did not matter for constitutional vagueness purposes, before Johnson and Dimaya.  In any event, the question is what to do now after Johnson and Dimaya.  The answer should not be hard.  To quote Judge William Pryor, writing for five judges in the Eleventh Circuit, how “did we ever reach the point where” we “must debate whether a carjacking in which an assailant struck a 13-year-old girl in the mouth with a baseball bat and a cohort fired an AK–47 at her family is a crime of violence?  It’s nuts.”  Ovalles, 905 F. 3d, at 1253 (concurring opinion).

															To be sure, the consequences cannot change our understanding of the law.  But when the consequences are this bad, it is useful to double-check the work.  And double-checking here, in my view, reveals several problems: relying on cases from the prior-conviction context whose rationales do not apply in this current-offense context; not fully accounting for the long tradition of substantial-risk criminal statutes; not reading the words of the statute in context and consistent with precedents such as Hayes; and then, perhaps most problematically, misapplying the longstanding constitutional avoidance canon.  After double-checking, it should be evident that the law does not compel those serious consequences.  I am not persuaded that the Court can blame this decision on Congress.  The Court has a way out, if it wants a way out.

															The Court usually reads statutes with a presumption of rationality and a presumption of constitutionality.  Instead of reading §924(c)(3)(B) to ensure that it is constitutional, the Court reads §924(c)(3)(B) in a way that makes it unconstitutional.  The bedrock principle that the Court interprets ambiguous statutes to avoid unconstitutionality is seemingly transformed into a principle of interpreting ambiguous statutes to lead to unconstitutionality.

															I respect and entirely understand how the Court got here.  Johnson and Dimaya were earth-rattling decisions.  But we should not follow Johnson and Dimaya off the constitutional cliff in this different §924(c) context.  Unlike the statutes at issue in Johnson and Dimaya, this statute is not a prior-conviction statute.  This statute operates entirely in the present and is not remotely vague.  I respectfully dissent.

 Section 924(c)(1)(A) provides: “Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime—(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years; (ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and (iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.”  Section 924(c)(1)(B) imposes heightened penalties for certain types of firearms and firearm devices, and §924(c)(1)(C) imposes heightened penalties for subsequent §924(c) convictions.

 Section 924(c)(3) provides: “For purposes of this subsection the term ‘crime of violence’ means an offense that is a felony and—(A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.”

 Tellingly, the Government in Johnson and Dimaya did not dispute that the categorical approach was the proper method of interpreting the statutes at issue.  See Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13); Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 13).  In this case, the Government strenuously disputes the applicability of the categorical approach precisely because the inquiry is not about past convictions. 

21
 More generally, this Court has often said that “identical language may convey varying content” in the same statute, based on context.  Yates v. United States,

574 U.S. 528, 537 (2015) (plurality opinion); see also Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA,

573 U.S. 302, 319–320 (2014). 

22
 This duplication point is icing on a textual cake already frosted.  In other words, our interpretation of the term “offense” is informed by the text and by our precedents.  Our interpretation stands with or without the duplication argument. 

23
 In Leocal, the Court interpreted §16(b) to require a categorical approach.  But unlike §924(c)(3)(B), that statutory provision applied in the context of past convictions.  See 8 U. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, §217(a),

98Stat.
2021; Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, §1202,

98Stat.
2151.  To be sure, §16(b) was once incorporated into §924(c).  But in 1986, Congress severed the two provisions and included a standalone “crime of violence” definition in §924(c).  For those two reasons, §924(c)(3)(B) need not and should not be interpreted in the same way as §16(b).
