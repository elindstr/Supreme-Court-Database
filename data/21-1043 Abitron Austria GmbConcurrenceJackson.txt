															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															_________________

															No. 21–1043

															_________________

															ABITRON AUSTRIA GmbH, et al., PETITIONERS
v. HETRONIC INTERNATIONAL, INC.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the tenth circuit

															[June 29, 2023]

															

															Justice Jackson, concurring.

															I agree with the Court that 15
U. S. C. §1114(1)(a) and §1125(a)(1) do not
apply extraterritorially. Ante, at 7. I also agree that the
“ ‘use in commerce’ of a trademark”
that both statutory sections describe “provides the dividing
line between foreign and domestic applications” of these
provisions. Ante, at 14. The Court has no need to elaborate
today upon what it means to “use [a trademark] in
commerce,” §1127, nor need it discuss how that meaning
guides the permissible-domestic-application question in a
particular case. I write separately to address those points.

															It is clear beyond cavil that what makes a
trademark a trademark under the Lanham Act is its
source-identifying function. See Jack Daniel’s Properties,
Inc. v. VIP Products LLC, 599 U. S. ___, ___ (2023)
(slip op., at 3); Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products
Co., 514 U.S.
159, 162–163 (1995). That is, under the Act, a trademark
is “any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination
thereof,” that “a person” “use[s]” or
“inten[ds] to use” “to identify and distinguish
his or her goods . . . from those manufactured or sold by
others and to indicate the source of the goods.” §1127;
see also Qualitex Co., 514 U. S., at 162–163
(emphasizing centrality of this source-identifying function).
Sections 1114(1)(a) and 1125(a)(1) permit a mark owner to sue
someone who is “us[ing that] mark in commerce” in a way
“ ‘likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake,
or to deceive.’ ” B&B Hardware, Inc. v.
Hargis Industries, Inc., 575 U.S. 138, 144 (2015).

															Critically, the Act defines
“ ‘use in commerce’ ” as
“the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of
trade.” §1127. And, in light of the core
source-identifying function of marks, Congress’s statutory
scheme embodies a distinction between trademark uses (use of
a symbol or equivalent “ ‘to identify or brand [a
defendant’s] goods or services’ ”) and
“ ‘non-trademark uses’ ” (use of
a symbol—even the same one—“ in a
‘non-source-identifying way’ ”). Jack
Daniel’s, 599 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). This
all points to something key about what it means to use a trademark
in the sense Congress prohibited—i.e., in a way likely
to commit the “cardinal sin” of “confus[ing]
consumers about source.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at
14).

															Simply put, a “use in commerce” does
not cease at the place the mark is first affixed, or where the item
to which it is affixed is first sold. Rather, it can occur wherever
the mark serves its source-identifying function. So, even after a
trademark begins to be “use[d] in commerce” (say, when
goods on which it is placed are sold), that trademark is also
“use[d] in commerce” wherever and whenever those goods
are in commerce, because as long as they are, the trademark
“identif[ies] and distinguish[es] . . . the source
of the goods.” §1127. Such a use is not free-floating;
the trademark is being used by the “person” who
put that trademark on the goods “to identify and
distinguish” them in commerce and “indicate the[ir]
source.” Ibid. This is the “use in
commerce” to which §1114(1)(a) and §1125(a)(1)
refer.

															Because it is “use in
commerce”—as Congress has defined it—that
“provides the dividing line between foreign and domestic
applications of ” these provisions, ante, at 14,
the permissible-domestic-application inquiry ought to be
straightforward. If a marked good is in domestic commerce, and the
mark is serving a source-identifying function in the way Congress
described, §1114(1)(a) and §1125(a)(1) may reach the
“person,” §1127, who is “us[ing that m]ark
as a trademark,” Jack Daniel’s, 599 U. S.,
at ___ (slip op., at 14). But if the mark is not serving
that function in domestic commerce, then the conduct Congress cared
about is not occurring domestically, and these provisions’
purely domestic sweep cannot touch that person.

															Consider an example. Imagine that a German
company begins making and selling handbags in Germany marked
“Coache” (the owner’s family name). Next, imagine
that American students buy the bags while on spring break overseas,
and upon their return home employ those bags to carry personal
items. Imagine finally that a representative of Coach (the United
States company) sees the students with the bags and persuades Coach
to sue the German company for Lanham Act infringement, fearing that
the “Coache” mark will cause consumer confusion. Absent
additional facts, such a claim seeks an impermissibly
extraterritorial application of the Act. The mark affixed to the
students’ bags is not being “use[d] in commerce”
domestically as the Act understands that phrase: to serve a
source-identifying function “in the ordinary course of
trade,” §1127.

															Now change the facts in just one respect: The
American students tire of the bags six weeks after returning home,
and resell them in this country, confusing consumers and damaging
Coach’s brand. Now, the marked bags are in domestic
commerce; the marks that the German company affixed to them
overseas continue “to identify and distinguish” the
goods from others in the (now domestic) marketplace and to
“indicate the source of the goods.” Ibid. So the
German company continues to “use [the mark] in
commerce” within the meaning of the Act, thus triggering
potential liability under §1114(1)(a) and §1125(a)(1).
This result makes eminent sense given the source-identifying
function of a trademark.[1]

															In brief, once the marks on its bags are serving
their core source-identifying function in commerce in the United
States, this German company is
doing—domestically—exactly what Congress sought to
proscribe. Accordingly, the German company may be subject to
liability for this domestic conduct—i.e., it cannot
successfully obtain dismissal of the lawsuit on extraterritoriality
grounds—even though it never sold the bags in, or directly
into, the United States.[2]

															Guided by this understanding of “use in
commerce,” I join the Court’s opinion in full.

Notes
1
 Trademarks facilitate the
accumulation of business goodwill whenever and wherever marked
goods are in commerce. The manufacturer of source-marked goods
reaps a goodwill benefit to the extent that consumers like its
product, see Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc.,
505 U.S.
763, 774 (1992), and that benefit runs to the manufacturer
whenever a trademark is serving a source-identifying function with
respect to items in commerce—however that commercial status
came to be.

 I will not attempt to
discuss every way in which a marked item might be “in
commerce” such that the trademark is being used “in the
ordinary course of trade” domestically. §1127. But, in
the internet age, one could imagine a mark serving its critical
source-identifying function in domestic commerce even absent the
domestic physical presence of the items whose source it identifies.
See, e.g., 5 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition
§29:56 (5th ed. Supp. 2023) (“The use of an infringing
mark as part of an Internet site available for use in the United
States may constitute an infringement of the mark in the United
States”); 4 id., §25:54.50 (“When an
alleged infringing mark is used on the internet, the use is clearly
a ‘use in commerce’ ”); 1 id.,
§3:7 (discussing “evidence of use as a trademark”
where “a designation is prominently displayed in a way easily
recognized by web users as an indicator of origin”; accord,
In re Sones, 590 F.3d 1282, 1288 (CA Fed. 2009)
(observing, with respect to the use-in-commerce requirement, that a
“ ‘website [can be] an electronic retail store,
and the web page [can be] a shelf-talker or banner which encourages
the consumer to buy the product’ ”).
