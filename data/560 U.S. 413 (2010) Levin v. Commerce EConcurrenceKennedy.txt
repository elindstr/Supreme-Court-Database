SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
NO. 09-223

															RICHARD A. LEVIN, TAX COMMISSIONER OF OHIO,
PETITIONER v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of
appeals for the sixth circuit

															[June 1, 2010]

															   Justice Kennedy, concurring.

															   The Court’s rationale in
Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U. S. 88 (2004),
seems to me still doubtful. Nothing in the Court’s opinion
today expands Hibbs’ holding further, however, and
on that understanding I join the opinion of the Court.
