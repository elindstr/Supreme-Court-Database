The Sally v. United States
9 U.S. (5 Cranch) 372

APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT
OF THE DISTRICT OF MAINE
Syllabus 

															Decided:  that an appeal from the district Court of the district of Maine in a case of admiralty jurisdiction does not lie directly to the Supreme Court of the United States, but to the circuit court for the District of Massachusetts.

															In all cases where the district Court of Maine acts as a district court, the appeal is to the circuit court for the District of Massachusetts.

															This was an appeal from the sentence of the District Court for the District of Maine, condemning the sloop Sally and cargo for violation of the revenue laws of the United States.  The appeal was directly to this Court.

															The Court was of opinion that, this not being a case where the district court was acting as a circuit court, the appeal ought to have been to the Circuit Court of Massachusetts.

															Appeal dismissed.
