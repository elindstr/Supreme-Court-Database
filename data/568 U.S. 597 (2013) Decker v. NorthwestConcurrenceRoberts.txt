CENTER

															on writs of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[March 20, 2013]

															

															Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Alito
joins, concurring.

															The opinion concurring in part and dissenting in
part raises serious questions about the principle set forth in
Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S.
410 (1945), and Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S.
452 (1997). It may be ap-propriate to reconsider that principle
in an appropriate case. But this is not that case.

															Respondent suggested reconsidering Auer,
in one sentence in a footnote, with no argument. See Brief for
Respondent 42, n. 12. Petitioners said don’t do it,
again in a footnote. See Reply Brief for Petitioners in No.
11–338, p. 4, n. 1; see also Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S.
180, 223–224 (1997) (declining to decide question that
received only “scant argumentation”). Out of 22
amicus briefs, only two—filed by dueling groups of law
professors—addressed the issue on the merits. See Brief for
Law Professors as Amici Curiae on the Propriety of
Administrative Deference in Support of Respondent; Brief for Law
Professors as Amici Curiae in Support of Petitioners; see
also FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc., 568
U. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2013) (slip op., at 7, n. 4)
(declining to consider argument raised only by amicus).

															The issue is a basic one going to the heart of
administrative law. Questions of Seminole Rock and
Auer deference arise as a matter of course on a regular
basis. The bar is now aware that there is some interest in
reconsidering those cases, and has available to it a concise
statement of the arguments on one side of the issue.

															I would await a case in which the issue is
properly raised and argued. The present cases should be decided as
they have been briefed and argued, under existing precedent.
