															ROBERT MITCHELL JENNINGS, PETITIONER v. WILLIAM STEPHENS,
DIRECTOR, TEXAS DE-PARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, COR-RECTIONAL
INSTITUTIONS DIVISION

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the fifth circuit

															[January 14, 2015]

															Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Alito
join, dissenting.

															The Court holds today that a prisoner who obtains an order for
his release unless the State grants him a new sentencing proceeding
may, as an appellee, raise any alternative argument rejected below
that could have resulted in a similar order. In doing so, the
majority mistakenly equates a judgment granting a
conditional-release order with an ordinary civil judgment. I
respectfully dissent.

															I

															Title28 U.Â S.Â C.
Â§2253(c)(1)(A), as amended by the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), provides in relevant
part: â€œUnless a circuit justice or judge issues
a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the
court of appeals from .Â .Â . the final order
in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of
arises out of process issued by a State court.â€
Further, â€œ[a] certificate of appealability may
issue .Â .Â . only if the applicant has made
a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional
right,â€ and the certificate must
â€œindicate which specific issue or issues satisfy
[that] showing.â€
Â§Â§2253(c)(2),(3). Because Jennings did not
obtain a certificate of appealability (COA), we must consider
whether, by raising his
â€œcross-point,â€ he took an appeal
within the meaning of AEDPA.

															I agree with the majority that if a habeas petitioner takes what
is, in substance or in form, a cross-appeal to the Court of
Appeals, then he must obtain a COA. The failure to obtain a COA is
a jurisdictional bar to review. See Gonzalez v.
Thaler, 565 U.Â S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at
8). The critical question the Court faces is whether
Jenningsâ€™
â€œcross-pointâ€ was in fact a
cross-appeal.

															II

															A

															The majority correctly identifies the rule we apply to determine
whether a party has taken a cross-appeal, United States v.
American Railway Express Co.,265 U.Â S. 425,435
(1924), but then fails to apply it in accordance with the history
of the writ of habeas corpus, our precedents concerning
conditional-release orders, and traditional principles governing
equitable relief. Each of these guides supports the conclusion that
a prisoner who obtains a conditional-release order allowing the
State to resentence him in a new proceeding is entitled, if the
State elects that option, to a new sentencing proceeding free of
the specific constitutional violation identified by the district
court. Because a conditional-release order embodies this specific
right, an appelleeâ€™s attempt to add additional
errors is an attempt to modify or expand his rights under the
judgment.

															For most of its existence, the writ of habeas corpus was
understood far more narrowly than it is today. See Wright v.
West,505 U.Â S. 277â€“287
(1992) (opinion of Thomas, J.). Originally, it played only a
procedural role: It issued as of right when a prisoner showed
probable cause to believe he was being held
illegallyâ€”that is, without a conviction entered
by a court of competent jurisdiction over the
prisonerâ€”and obligated the warden to file a
â€œreturnâ€ identifying the grounds of
imprisonment. Â W. Church, A Treatise on the Writ of
Habeas Corpus Â§Â§94, 122 (rev. 2d ed. 1893)
(hereinafter Church). The â€œgrant of the writ
decided nothing except that there was a case calling for an answer
by the gaoler.â€ Goddard, A Note on Habeas Corpus, 65
L. Q. Rev. 30, 34 (1949). And the courtâ€™s
ultimate decision on the matter was limited to confirming the
legality of the prisonerâ€™s confinement or
ordering his immediate discharge. See Church
Â§Â§130, 131.

															The writ today, by contrast, is invoked to justify broad federal
review of state criminal proceedings for constitutional violations.
And, when a district court issues the writ, it usually enters a
conditional-release order, offering the State a choice between
immediate release or a retrial (or resentencing) within a defined
period of time. See Wilkinson v. Dotson,544
U.Â S. 74â€“87 (2005) (Scalia, J.,
concurring).

															The purpose of a conditional-release order is to afford the
State an opportunity to remedy the specific constitutional
violation identified by the district court. Since its inception
over a century ago, we have treated a conditional-release order as
entitling a habeas petitioner not just toa new proceeding, but to a
new proceeding that cures the specific defect identified by the
district court. One of our earliest precedents contemplating such
an order is InÂ re Bonner,151 U.Â S.
242â€“260 (1894). That case involved a prisoner
who had been lawfully convicted, but unlawfully ordered to serve
his federal sentence in a state penitentiary. Id., at
254â€“255, 260. Invoking its
â€œpower to control and direct the form of
judgment to be entered in cases brought up before it on habeas
corpus,â€ the Court ordered the delay of discharge
to allow the prisoner to be â€œtaken before the
court where the judgment was rendered, that the defects for
want of jurisdiction which are the subject of complaint in
that judgment may be corrected.â€ Id., at
261 (emphasis added); see also Magwood v.
Patterson,561 U.Â S. 320,347 (2010) (Kennedy, J.,
joined by, inter alios, Alito, J., dissenting)
(â€œ[A] conditional grant of relief
.Â .Â . allows the state court to correct an
error that occurred at the original sentencingâ€). That
understanding of habeas judgments has prevailed in an unbroken line
of precedent. See Richmond v. Lewis,506
U.Â S. 40,52 (1992); Hilton v.
Braunskill,481 U.Â S. 770,775 (1987); Dowd
v. United States exÂ rel. Cook,340
U.Â S. 206â€“210 (1951); Mahler
v. Eby,264 U.Â S. 32,46 (1924). Cf.
Dotson, supra, at 86 (Scalia, J., concurring)
(â€œ[T]he conditional writ serves only to
â€˜delay the release . . . in order to provide the
State an opportunity to correct the constitutional
violationâ€™Â â€ (quoting
Braunskill, supra, at 775)).

															When the State fails to cure the specific constitutional
violation identified by the district court, the habeas petitioner
is entitled to release. That is because the prevailing habeas
petitioner has shown that his conviction or sentencing proceeding
was unconstitutional and that he is therefore
â€œactually entitled to release.â€
Dotson, 544 U.Â S., at 86 (Scalia, J.,
concurring). â€œConditional writs enable habeas
courts to give States time to replace an invalid judgment with a
valid one, and the consequence when they fail to do so is always
release.â€ Id., at 87. But that entitlement to
release is tied to the constitutional violation identified by the
Court. A State committing a new constitutional violation during the
new sentencing proceeding will not be required to release the
habeas petitioner under the old order. Cf. Magwood,
supra, at 339 (explaining that a habeas petitioner who
obtains a new sentencing proceeding on the basis of one error may
subsequently raise, in a first habeas application, other errors
repeated in that proceeding).

															A habeas petitionerâ€™s rights under the
conditional-release order are thus defined by the violation that
justified its entry, not by the wording of the order.
Pitchess v. Davis,421 U.Â S. 482 (1975)
(per curiam), makes that clear. Davis involved a
prisoner who had obtained habeas relief because the prosecutor had
failed to disclose a material and exculpatory laboratory report, in
violation of Brady v. Maryland,373 U.Â S.
83 (1963). 421 U.Â S., at 483. When the State moved to
retry him, the prisoner discovered that the State had destroyed
some of the physical evidence used against him at his initial
trial. Id., at 484. The District Court granted the
prisonerâ€™s motion to convert its initial
conditional-release order into an unconditional order. Id.,
at 485. After the Court of Appeals affirmed that decision, this
Court granted certiorari and reversed. Id., at 486, 490.
Although the conditional-release order provided only that the
prisoner should be released unless the State moved to retry him
within 60 days, Davis v. Pitchess, 388
F.Â Supp. 105, 114 (CD Cal. 1974), the Court read that
conditional-release order to require the State to
â€œprovid[e] respondent with the laboratory
report,â€ in addition to moving to retry him within
60 days, Davis, 421 U.Â S., at 483 (emphasis
added). Because the order did not address the separate issue of the
physical evidence, the Court refused to allow the District Court to
use its destruction as a basis for converting the
conditional-release order to an unconditional order.

															That decision makes sense when considered in light of
traditional principles of equitable relief.
â€œThis Court has frequently rested its habeas
decisions on equitable principles.â€ Withrow v.
Williams,507 U.Â S. 680,717 (1993) (Scalia, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part). (Such principles remain
relevant after AEDPAâ€™s enactment when they are
consistent with the statutory scheme Congress adopted. See,
e.g., McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.Â S.
___, ___ â€“ ___ (2013) (Scalia, J., dissenting)
(slip op., at 2â€“3).) And the Court has
frequently recognized that an equitable â€œremedy
must .Â .Â . be limited to the inadequacy
that producedâ€ the asserted injury. Lewis v.
Casey,518 U.Â S. 343,357 (1996). Thus, a
conditional-release order will not â€œpermit a
federal habeas court to maintain a continuing supervision over a
retrial conducted pursuant to a conditional writ granted by the
habeas court.â€ Davis, 421 U.Â S., at
490. But neither will a conditional-release order permit a State to
hold a prisoner under a new judgment infected by the same
constitutional violation that justified the
orderâ€™s entry in the first place. See
Dotson, supra, at 87 (Scalia, J., concurring);
Harvest v. Castro, 531 F.Â 3d 737, 750
(CA9 2008); Phifer v. Warden, 53 F.Â 3d
859, 864â€“865 (CA7 1995). Such an interpretation
of ha-beas judgments would render the writ hollow.

															The history of the writ of habeas corpus, the treatment of
conditional-release orders, and traditional principles of equitable
relief resolve the dispute at issue here. A habeas petitioner
awarded a conditional-release order based onan error at his
sentencing proceeding is entitled, under that order, to a new
proceeding without the specific constitutional violation identified
by the district court. Raising any other constitutional violation
on appeal would be an attempt to modify the
prisonerâ€™s rights flowing from that order.

															B

															Given these principles, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
should be affirmed. Jennings prevailed in the District Court on two
theories of ineffective assistance of counsel and lost on another.
The District Court entered a conditional-release order instructing
the State to release Jennings unless it granted Jennings a new
sentencing hearing within 120 days or commuted his sentence.
Ante, at 5. Under this Courtâ€™s
precedents, that general order embodies a specific instruction to
the State with respect to a new sentencing proceeding: resentence
Jennings without the two identified Wiggins errors. See
ante, at 3 (citing Wiggins v. Smith,539
U.Â S. 510 (2003)). The Stateâ€™s
failure to comply with that order would justify
Jenningsâ€™ release. Jennings attempted, through
his cross-point, to expand his rights under the judgment when he
attempted to alter the instruction to the
Stateâ€”adding an additional instruction about a
Spisak errorâ€”and, accordingly, the
grounds upon which he could obtain immediate release. See
ante, at 3 (citing Smith v. Spisak,558
U.Â S. 139 (2010)). Jenningsâ€™
cross-point was in substance a cross-appeal for which he needed to
obtain a COA.

															III

															A

															The majority makes no attempt to reconcile its decision with the
history of conditional-release orders, our precedents, or
traditional limitations on equitable relief. Nor could it. Instead,
it divines an â€œintuitive answerâ€ to
the question presented, ante, at 5, from the law of
judgments. But not only is this the incorrect source of law, the
major-ityâ€™s position is fundamentally at odds
with the law of judgments on which it purports to rely.

															The majority agrees that, to understand how the cross-appeal
rule applies in a given case, one must understand the rights that
parties obtained under the judgment at issue. But the majority
refuses to look past the language of the conditional-release order.
It is, of course, true that parties domesticate judgments, not
opinions. Ante, at 5â€“6. And it is
similarly true that prevailing parties enforce judgments, not
reasoning. Ante, at 6. Those truisms, however, do not answer
the question here, which is what rights flow from those
judgments.

															In answering that question, the majority simply announces
that the rights that flow from a habeas
petitionerâ€™s judgment are the same rights that
flow from any other civil judgment. But that assertion ignores the
unique context of habeas, in which the traditional principles of
the law of judgments have never applied. As explained above, the
writ of habeas corpus was historically a purely procedural
mechanism to obtain a courtâ€™s determination as
to the legality of a prisonerâ€™s confinement.
Church Â§Â§94, 122, 130, 131. And that
determination was never treated as an ordinary civil judgment
entitled to res judicata effect. Id., Â§386; see
also McCleskey v. Zant,499 U.Â S. 467,479
(1991).

															Even if the majority were correct that the law of judgments
could simply be imported to the habeas context, it misapplies that
law. Under long recognized principles, including the doctrine of
preclusion, parties have greater rights under civil judgments than
merely the particular relief afforded. A prevailing
plaintiffâ€™s claims are wholly merged into his
judgment, preventing a defendant, in a future action on that
judgment, from availing himself of defenses that he could have
raised in the courtâ€™s first adjudication of the
claims. Restatement (Second) of Judgments Â§18 (1980).
And a defendant, whether victorious or not, can rely upon that
judgment as the final adjudication of a particular claim,
preventing the plaintiff from pursuing another action against him
in the future on that same claim. Id., Â§19.
These principles give rights to the parties beyond the remedy
ordered. By narrowly and artificially defining the rights flowing
from a civil judgment as solely those rights identified in a
written order, the majority disregards these basic principles. And
because the majority purports to apply the general law of
judgments, its decision will do damage well beyond the habeas
context in which this case arises.

															B

															In the habeas context specifically, the
majorityâ€™s opinion invites the same frivolous
appeals that Congress passed AEDPA to prevent. Although courts had
long relied on the certificate of probable cause as a mechanism to
prevent frivolous appeals in habeas cases, AEDPA further narrowed
access to such appeals with the creation of the COA requirement.
Miller-El v. Cockrell,537 U.Â S. 322,356
(2003) (Thomas, J., dissenting). A habeas petitioner cannot obtain
a COA absent a substantial showing of the denial of a
constitutional, not merely federal, right. See Slack
v. McDaniel,529 U.Â S.
473â€“484 (2000). This requirement serves an
important gatekeeping function. But the
majorityâ€™s decision will seriously undermine
the courtsâ€™ ability to perform this function by
allowing prisoners to pursue any alternative allegation, no
matter how frivolous, that would have justified the same new
proceeding awarded in the conditional-release order below.

															This danger is by no means
â€œexaggerated,â€ ante, at 7,
as the majority suggests. Habeas petitioners frequently pursue 20
or more arguments on collateral review, even though they could more
effectively concentrate on a handful of arguments. See,
e.g., Calvert v. Henderson, 2012 WL 1033632,
*1 (ED La., Mar. 27, 2012) (raising 26 allegations of ineffective
assistance of counsel); Battle v. Roper, 2009 WL
799604, *13 (ED Mo., Mar. 24, 2009) (raising 1 double jeopardy
issue and 20 allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel). I
see little reason to suspect that the prisoners who file these
scattershot applications will suddenly alter their strategy on
appeal. Indeed, the experience of the Courts of Appeals suggests
otherwise. See, e.g., Jones v. Keane, 329
F.Â 3d 290, 296 (CA2 2003) (noting, but refusing to
consider absent a COA, a prevailing ha-beas
petitionerâ€™s â€œalternative
groundsâ€ for
affirmanceâ€”allegations of insufficiency of the
evidence and ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate
counsel). And the experience of the Courts of Appeals with this
conduct is only likely to grow now that the majority has approved
it. Where before only the United States Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit had permitted prevailing habeas petitioners to
raise rejected claims as alternative grounds for affirmance, now
all Courts of Appeals will be subject to that rule.

															The majority also overlooks a significant procedural distinction
between an application for a COA and a merits appeal. The majority
expresses â€œdoubt that any more judicial time
will be wasted in rejection of frivolous claims made in defense of
judgment on an appeal already taken than would be wasted in
rejection of similar claims made in .Â .Â . a
separate proceeding for a certificate of
appealability.â€ Ante, at 8. But a COA can be
decided by a single court of appeals judge,28
U.Â S.Â C. Â§2253(c)(1), while a
merits appeal must be heard by a three-judge panel. By mandating
the involvement of two additional judges in the adjudication of
these claims, todayâ€™s ruling triples the
burden on the Courts of Appeals.

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															This Court has repeatedly recognized that
AEDPAâ€™s purpose is to
â€œreduc[e] delays in the execution of state and
federal criminal sentences.â€ Ryan v.
Valencia Gonzales, 568 U.Â S. ___, ___ (2013)
(slip op., at 17) (internal quotation marks omitted). One of the
key ways in which AEDPA encourages finality is to narrow the scope
of appellate review by requiring habeas petitioners to obtain COAs.
The majorityâ€™s decision undermines that
legislative choice and, in so doing, transforms the understandingof
conditional-release orders that has prevailed sincethe Court first
announced their creation. I respectfully dissent.
