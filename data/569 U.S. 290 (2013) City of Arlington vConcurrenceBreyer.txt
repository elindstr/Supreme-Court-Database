court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[May 20, 2013]

															

															Justice Breyer, concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment.

															I agree with the Court that normally “the
question a court faces when confronted with an agency’s
interpretation of a statute it administers” is,
“simply, whether the agency has stayed within the bounds
of its statutory authority.” Ante, at 5–6.
In this context, “the distinction between
‘jurisdictional’ and ‘non-jurisdictional’
interpretations is a mirage.” Ante, at 5.

															Deciding just what those statutory bounds are,
however, is not always an easy matter, and the Court’s case
law abounds with discussion of the subject. A reviewing judge, for
example, will have to decide independently whether Congress
delegated authority to the agency to provide interpretations of, or
to enact rules pursuant to, the statute at
issue—interpretations or rules that carry with them
“the force of law.” United States v. Mead
Corp., 533 U.S.
218, 229 (2001). If so, the reviewing court must give special
leeway or “deference” to the agency’s
interpretation. See id., at 227–228.

															We have added that, if “[e]mploying
traditional tools of statutory construction,” INS v.
Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S.
421, 446 (1987), the court determines that Congress has spoken
clearly on the disputed question, then “that is the end of
the matter,” Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S.
837, 842 (1984). The agency is due no deference, for Congress
has left no gap for the agency to fill. Id., at
842–844. If, on the other hand, Congress has not spoken
clearly, if, for example it has written ambiguously, then that
ambiguity is a sign—but not always a conclusive
sign—that Congress intends a reviewing court to pay
particular attention to (i.e., to give a degree of deference
to) the agency’s interpretation. See Gonzales v.
Oregon, 546 U.S.
243, 258–269 (2006); Mead, supra, at 229.

															I say that the existence of statutory ambiguity
is sometimes not enough to warrant the conclusion that Congress has
left a deference-warranting gap for the agency to fill be- cause
our cases make clear that other, sometimes context-specific,
factors will on occasion prove relevant. (And, given the vast
number of government statutes, regulatory programs, and underlying
circumstances, that variety is hardly surprising.) In Mead,
for example, we looked to several factors other than simple
ambiguity to help determine whether Congress left a statutory gap,
thus delegating to the agency the authority to fill that gap with
an interpretation that would carry “the force of law.”
533 U. S., at 229–231. Elsewhere, we have assessed

															“the interstitial nature of the
legal question, the re- lated expertise of the Agency, the
importance of the question to administration of the statute, the
complexity of that administration, and the careful consideration
the Agency has given the question over a long period of
time.” Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S.
212, 222 (2002).

															The subject matter of the relevant
provision—for instance, its distance from the agency’s
ordinary statutory duties or its falling within the scope of
another agency’s authority—has also proved relevant.
See Gonzalez, supra, at 265–266. See also
Gellhorn & Verkuil, Controlling Chevron-Based
Delegations, 20 Cardozo L. Rev. 989, 1007–1010
(1999).

															Moreover, the statute’s text, its context,
the structure of the statutory scheme, and canons of textual
construction are relevant in determining whether the statute is
ambiguous and can be equally helpful in determining whether such
ambiguity comes accompanied with agency authority to fill a gap
with an interpretation that carries the force of law. See
Household Credit Services, Inc. v. Pfennig, 541 U.S.
232, 239–242 (2004); Zuni Public School Dist. No.
89 v. Department of Education, 550 U.S.
81, 98–99 (2007); FDA v. Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S.
120, 133 (2000); Dole v. Steelworkers, 494 U.S.
26, 36 (1990). Statutory purposes, including those revealed in
part by legislative and regulatory history, can be similarly
relevant. See Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,
supra, at 143–147; Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S.
633, 649 (1990); Global Crossing Telecommunications,
Inc. v. Metrophones Telecommunications, Inc., 550 U.S.
45, 48–49 (2007). See also AT&T Corp. v.
Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U.S.
366, 412–413 (1999) (Breyer, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part).

															Although seemingly complex in abstract
description, in practice this framework has proved a workable way
to approximate how Congress would likely have meant to allocate
interpretive law-determining authority between reviewing court and
agency. The question whether Congress has delegated to an agency
the authority to provide an interpretation that carries the force
of law is for the judge to answer independently. The judge,
considering “traditional tools of statutory
construction,” Cardoza-Fonseca, supra, at 446,
will ask whether Congress has spoken unambiguously. If so, the text
controls. If not, the judge will ask whether Congress would have
intended the agency to resolve the resulting ambiguity. If so,
deference is warranted. See Mead, supra, at 229. Even
if not, however, sometimes an agency interpretation, in light of
the agency’s special expertise, will still have the
“power to persuade, if lacking power to control,”
Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323
U.S. 134, 140 (1944).

															The case before us offers an example. The
relevant statutory provision requires state or local governments to
act on wireless siting applications “within a reasonable
period of time after” a wireless service provider files such
a request. 47 U. S. C. §332(c)(7)(B)(ii). The
Federal Com- munications Commission (FCC) argued that this pro-
vision granted it a degree of leeway in determining the amount of
time that is reasonable. Many factors favor the agency’s
view: (1) the language of the Telecommunications Act grants
the FCC broad authority (including rulemaking authority) to
administer the Act; (2) the words are
open-ended—i.e. “ambiguous”; (3) the
provision concerns an interstitial administrative matter, in
respect to which the agency’s expertise could have an
important role to play; and (4) the matter, in context, is
complex, likely making the agency’s expertise useful in
helping to answer the “rea- sonableness” question that
the statute poses. See §151 (creating the FCC); §201(b)
(providing rulemaking auth- ority); National Cable &
Telecommunications Assn. v. Brand X Internet Services,
545 U.S.
967, 980–981 (2005) (acknowledging the FCC’s
authority to administer the Act).

															On the other side of the coin, petitioners point
to two statutory provisions which, they believe, require a
different conclusion—namely, that the FCC lacked authority
altogether to interpret §332(c)(7)(B)(ii). First, a nearby
saving clause says: “Except as provided in this paragraph,
nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of a
State or local government or instrumentality thereof over decisions
regarding the placement, construction, and modification of personal
wireless service facilities.” §332(c)(7)(A). Second, a
judicial review provision, says: “Any person adversely
affected by any final action or failure to act by a State or local
government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with
this subparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure
to act, commence an action in any court of competent
jurisdiction.” §332(c)(7)(B)(v).

															In my view, however, these two provisions cannot
provide good reason for reaching the conclusion advocated by
petitioners. The first provision begins with an exception, stating
that it does not apply to (among other things) the
“reasonableness” provision here at issue. The second
sim- ply sets forth a procedure for judicial review, a review that
applies to most government actions. Both are consistent with a
statutory scheme that gives States, localities, the FCC, and
reviewing courts each some role to play in the location of wireless
service facilities. And neither “expressly describ[es] an
exception” to the FCC’s plenary authority to interpret
the Act. American Hospital Assn. v. NLRB, 499 U.S.
606, 613 (1991).

															For these reasons, I would reject
petitioners’ argument and conclude that
§332(c)(7)(B)(ii)—the “reasonableness”
statute—leaves a gap for the FCC to fill. I would hold that
the FCC’s lawful efforts to do so carry “the force of
law.” Mead, 533 U. S., at 229. The Court
of Appeals ultimately reached the same conclusion (though for
somewhat dif- ferent reasons), and the majority affirms the lower
court. I consequently join the majority’s judgment and such
por- tions of its opinion as are consistent with what I have
written here.
