															EVANGELISTO RAMOS, PETITIONER v. LOUISIANA

															on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of louisiana, fourth circuit

															[April 20, 2020]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh, concurring in part.

															In Apodaca v. Oregon, this Court held that state juries need not be unanimous in order to convict a criminal defendant.

406 U.S. 404 (1972).  Two States, Louisiana and Oregon, have continued to use non-unanimous juries in criminal cases.  Today, the Court overrules Apodaca and holds that state juries must be unanimous in order to convict a criminal defendant.

															I agree with the Court that the time has come to overrule Apodaca.  I therefore join the introduction and Parts I, II–A, III, and IV–B–1 of the Court’s persuasive and important opinion.  I write separately to explain my view of how stare decisis applies to this case.

															I

															The legal doctrine of stare decisis derives from the Latin maxim “stare decisis et non quieta movere,” which means to stand by the thing decided and not disturb the calm.  The doctrine reflects respect for the accumulated wisdom of judges who have previously tried to solve the same problem.  In 1765, Blackstone—“the preeminent authority on English law for the founding generation,” Alden v. Maine,

527 U.S. 706, 715 (1999)—wrote that “it is an established rule to abide by former precedents,” to “keep the scale of justice even and steady, and not liable to waver with every new judge’s opinion.”  1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 69 (1765).  The Framers of our Constitution understood that the doctrine of stare decisis is part of the “judicial Power” and rooted in Article III of the Constitution.  Writing in Federalist 78, Alexander Hamilton emphasized the importance of stare decisis: To “avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable” that federal judges “should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them.”  The Federalist No. 78, p. 529 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  In the words of The Chief Justice, stare decisis’ “greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal—the rule of law.”  Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n,

558 U.S. 310, 378 (2010) (concurring opinion).

															This Court has repeatedly explained that stare decisis “promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.”  Payne v. Tennessee,

501 U.S. 808, 827 (1991).  The doctrine “permits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals, and thereby contributes to the integrity of our constitutional system of government, both in appearance and in fact.”  Vasquez v. Hillery,

474 U.S. 254, 265–266 (1986).

															The doctrine of stare decisis does not mean, of course, that the Court should never overrule erroneous precedents.  All Justices now on this Court agree that it is sometimes appropriate for the Court to overrule erroneous decisions.  Indeed, in just the last few Terms, every current Member of this Court has voted to overrule multiple constitutional precedents.  See, e.g., Knick v. Township of Scott, 588 U. S. ___ (2019); Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Hyatt, 587 U. S. ___ (2019); Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U. S. ___ (2018); Hurst v. Florida, 577 U. S. ___ (2016); Obergefell v. Hodges,

576 U.S. 644 (2015); Johnson v. United States,

576 U.S. 591 (2015); Alleyne v. United States,

570 U.S. 99 (2013); see also Baude, Precedent and Discretion, 2020 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 4 (forthcoming) (“Nobody on the Court believes in absolute stare decisis”).

															Historically, moreover, some of the Court’s most notable and consequential decisions have entailed overruling precedent.  See, e.g., Obergefell v. Hodges,

576 U.S. 644 (2015); Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n,

558 U.S. 310 (2010); Montejo v. Louisiana,

556 U.S. 778 (2009); Crawford v. Washington,

541 U.S. 36 (2004); Lawrence v. Texas,

539 U.S. 558 (2003); Ring v. Arizona,

536 U.S. 584 (2002); Agostini v. Felton,

521 U.S. 203 (1997); Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,

517 U.S. 44 (1996); Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,

505 U.S. 833 (1992);[1] Payne v. Tennessee,

501 U.S. 808 (1991); Batson v. Kentucky,

476 U.S. 79 (1986); Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,

469 U.S. 528 (1985); Illinois v. Gates,

462 U.S. 213 (1983); United States v. Scott,

437 U.S. 82 (1978); Craig v. Boren,

429 U.S. 190 (1976); Taylor v. Louisiana,

419 U.S. 522 (1975); Brandenburg v. Ohio,

395 U.S. 444 (1969) (per curiam); Katz v. United States,

389 U.S. 347 (1967); Miranda v. Arizona,

384 U.S. 436 (1966); Malloy v. Hogan,

378 U.S. 1 (1964); Wesberry v. Sanders,

376 U.S. 1 (1964); Gideon v. Wainwright,

372 U.S. 335 (1963); Baker v. Carr,

369 U.S. 186 (1962); Mapp v. Ohio,

367 U.S. 643 (1961); Brown v. Board of Education, 
347 U.S. 483 (1954); Smith v. Allwright,

321 U.S. 649 (1944); West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette,

319 U.S. 624 (1943); United States v. Darby,

312 U.S. 100 (1941); Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,

304 U.S. 64 (1938); West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,

300 U.S. 379 (1937).

															The lengthy and extraordinary list of landmark cases that overruled precedent includes the single most important and greatest decision in this Court’s history, Brown v. Board of Education, which repudiated the separate but equal doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson,

163 U.S. 537 (1896).

															As those many examples demonstrate, the doctrine of stare decisis does not dictate, and no one seriously maintains, that the Court should never overrule erroneous precedent.  As the Court has often stated and repeats today, stare decisis is not an “inexorable command.”  E.g., ante,  at 20.

															On the other hand, as Justice Jackson explained, just “because one should avoid Scylla is no reason for crashing into Charybdis.” Jackson, Decisional Law and Stare Decisis, 30 A. B. A. J. 334 (1944).  So no one advocates that the Court should always overrule erroneous precedent.

															Rather, applying the doctrine of stare decisis, this Court ordinarily adheres to precedent, but sometimes overrules precedent.  The difficult question, then, is when to overrule an erroneous precedent.

															To begin with, the Court’s precedents on precedent distinguish statutory cases from constitutional cases.

															In statutory cases, stare decisis is comparatively strict, as history shows and the Court has often stated.  That is because Congress and the President can alter a statutory precedent by enacting new legislation.  To be sure, enacting new legislation requires finding room in a crowded legislative docket and securing the agreement of the House, the Senate (in effect, 60 Senators), and the President.  Both by design and as a matter of fact, enacting new legislation is difficult—and far more difficult than the Court’s cases sometimes seem to assume.  Nonetheless, the Court has ordinarily left the updating or correction of erroneous statutory precedents to the legislative process.  See, e.g., Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC,

576 U.S. 446, 456–457 (2015); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,

491 U.S. 164, 172–173 (1989); Flood v. Kuhn,

407 U.S. 258, 283–284 (1972).  The principle that “it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right” is “commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation.”  Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.,

285 U.S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).[2]

															In constitutional cases, by contrast, the Court has repeatedly said—and says again today—that the doctrine of stare decisis is not as “inflexible.”  Burnet, 285 U. S., at 406 (Brandeis, J., dissenting); see also ante, at 20; Payne, 501 U. S., at 828; Scott, 437 U. S., at 101.  The reason is straightforward: As Justice O’Connor once wrote for the Court, stare decisis is not as strict “when we interpret the Constitution because our interpretation can be altered only by constitutional amendment or by overruling our prior decisions.”  Agostini, 521 U. S., at 235.  The Court therefore “must balance the importance of having constitutional questions decided against the importance of having them decided right.”  Citizens United, 558 U. S., at 378 (Roberts, C. J., concurring).  It follows “that in the unusual circumstance when fidelity to any particular precedent does more to damage this constitutional ideal than to advance it, we must be more willing to depart from that precedent.”  Ibid.  In his canonical opinion in Burnet, Justice Brandeis described the Court’s practice with respect to stare decisis in constitutional cases in a way that was accurate then and remains accurate now: In “cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.”  285 U. S., at 406–407 (dissenting opinion).

															That said, in constitutional as in statutory cases, to “overrule an important precedent is serious business.”  Jackson, 30 A. B. A. J., at 334.  In constitutional as in statutory cases, adherence to precedent is the norm.  To overrule a constitutional decision, the Court’s precedents on precedent still require a “special justification,” Allen v. Cooper, 589 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted); Arizona v. Rumsey,

467 U.S. 203, 212 (1984), or otherwise stated, “strong grounds,”  Janus, 585 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 34).

															In particular, to overrule a constitutional precedent, the Court requires something “over and above the belief that the precedent was wrongly decided.”  Allen, 589 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (internal quotation marks omitted).  As Justice Scalia put it, the doctrine of stare decisis always requires “reasons that go beyond mere demonstration that the overruled opinion was wrong,” for “otherwise the doctrine would be no doctrine at all.”  Hubbard v. United States,

514 U.S. 695, 716 (1995) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  To overrule, the Court demands a special justification or strong grounds.

															But the “special justification” or “strong grounds” formulation elides a key question: What constitutes a special justification or strong grounds?[3]  In other words, in deciding whether to overrule an erroneous constitutional decision, how does the Court know when to overrule and when to stand pat?

															As the Court has exercised the “judicial Power” over time, the Court has identified various stare decisis factors.  In articulating and applying those factors, the Court has, to borrow James Madison’s words, sought to liquidate and ascertain the meaning of the Article III “judicial Power” with respect to precedent.  The Federalist No. 37, at 236.

															The stare decisis factors identified by the Court in its past cases include:

															the quality of the precedent’s reasoning;

															the precedent’s consistency and coherence with previous or subsequent decisions;

															changed law since the prior decision;

															changed facts since the prior decision;

															the workability of the precedent;

															the reliance interests of those who have relied on the precedent; and

															the age of the precedent.

															But the Court has articulated and applied those various individual factors without establishing any consistent methodology or roadmap for how to analyze all of the factors taken together.  And in my view, that muddle poses a problem for the rule of law and for this Court, as the Court attempts to apply stare decisis principles in a neutral and consistent manner.

															As I read the Court’s cases on precedent, those varied and somewhat elastic stare decisis factors fold into three broad considerations that, in my view, can help guide the inquiry and help determine what constitutes a “special justification” or “strong grounds” to overrule a prior constitutional decision.

															First, is the prior decision not just wrong, but grievously or egregiously wrong?  A garden-variety error or disagreement does not suffice to overrule.  In the view of the Court that is considering whether to overrule, the precedent must be egregiously wrong as a matter of law in order for the Court to overrule it.  In conducting that inquiry, the Court may examine the quality of the precedent’s reasoning, consistency and coherence with other decisions, changed law, changed facts, and workability, among other factors.  A case may be egregiously wrong when decided, see, e.g., Korematsu v. United States,

323 U.S. 214 (1944); Plessy v. Ferguson,

163 U.S. 537 (1896), or may be unmasked as egregiously wrong based on later legal or factual understandings or developments, see, e.g., Nevada v. Hall,

440 U.S. 410 (1979), or both, ibid.

															Second, has the prior decision caused significant negative jurisprudential or real-world consequences?  In conducting that inquiry, the Court may consider jurisprudential consequences (some of which are also relevant to the first inquiry), such as workability, as well as consistency and coherence with other decisions, among other factors.  Importantly, the Court may also scrutinize the precedent’s real-world effects on the citizenry, not just its effects on the law and the legal system.  See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S., at 494–495; Barnette, 319 U. S., at 630–642; see also Payne, 501 U. S., at 825–827.

															Third, would overruling the prior decision unduly upset reliance interests?  This consideration focuses on the legitimate expectations of those who have reasonably relied on the precedent.  In conducting that inquiry, the Court may examine a variety of reliance interests and the age of the precedent, among other factors.

															In short, the first consideration requires inquiry into how wrong the precedent is as a matter of law.  The second and third considerations together demand, in Justice Jackson’s words, a “sober appraisal of the disadvantages of the innovation as well as those of the questioned case, a weighing of practical effects of one against the other.”  Jackson, 30 A. B. A. J., at 334.

															Those three considerations together provide a structured methodology and roadmap for determining whether to overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent.  The three considerations correspond to the Court’s historical practice and encompass the various individual factors that the Court has applied over the years as part of the stare decisis calculus.  And they are consistent with the Founding understanding and, for example, Blackstone’s shorthand description that overruling is warranted when (and only when) a precedent is “manifestly absurd or unjust.”  1 Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, at 70.

															Taken together, those three considerations set a high (but not insurmountable) bar for overruling a precedent, and they therefore limit the number of overrulings and maintain stability in the law.[4]  Those three considerations also constrain judicial discretion in deciding when to overrule an erroneous precedent.  To be sure, applying those considerations is not a purely mechanical exercise, and I do not claim otherwise.  I suggest only that those three considerations may better structure how to consider the many traditional stare decisis factors.

															It is inevitable that judges of good faith applying the stare decisis considerations will sometimes disagree about when to overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent, as the Court does in this case.  To begin with, judges may disagree about whether a prior decision is wrong in the first place—and importantly, that disagreement is sometimes the real dispute when judges joust over stare decisis.  But even when judges agree that a prior decision is wrong, they may dis- agree about whether the decision is so egregiously wrong as to justify an overruling.  Judges may likewise disagree about the severity of the jurisprudential or real-world consequences caused by the erroneous decision and, therefore, whether the decision is worth overruling.  In that regard, some judges may think that the negative consequences can be addressed by narrowing the precedent (or just living with it) rather than outright overruling it.  Judges may also disagree about how to measure the relevant reliance interests that might be affected by an overruling.  And on top of all of that, judges may also disagree about how to weigh and balance all of those competing considerations in a given case.[5]

															This case illustrates that point.  No Member of the Court contends that the result in Apodaca is correct.  But the Members of the Court vehemently disagree about whether to overrule Apodaca.

															II

															Applying the three broad stare decisis considerations to this case, I agree with the Court’s decision to overrule Apodaca.

															First, Apodaca is egregiously wrong.  The original meaning and this Court’s precedents establish that the
 
Sixth Amendment requires a unanimous jury.  Ante, at 6–7; see, e.g., Patton v. United States,

281 U.S. 276, 288 (1930); Thompson v. Utah,

170 U.S. 343, 351 (1898).  And the original meaning and this Court’s precedents establish that the
 
Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth Amendment jury trial right against the States.  See Duncan v. Louisiana,

391 U.S. 145, 149 (1968); id., at 166 (Black, J., concurring); see also Malloy, 378 U. S., at 10–11; see generally Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___ (2019); McDonald v. Chicago,

561 U.S. 742 (2010).  When Apodaca was decided, it was already an outlier in the Court’s jurisprudence, and over time it has become even more of an outlier.  As the Court today persuasively explains, the original meaning of the Sixth and
 
Fourteenth Amendments and this Court’s two lines of decisions—the
 
Sixth Amendment jury cases and the
 
Fourteenth Amendment incorporation cases—overwhelmingly demonstrate that Apodaca’s holding is egregiously wrong.[6]

															Second, Apodaca causes significant negative consequences.  It is true that Apodaca is workable.  But Apodaca sanctions the conviction at trial or by guilty plea of some defendants who might not be convicted under the proper constitutional rule (although exactly how many is of course unknowable).  That consequence has traditionally supplied some support for overruling an egregiously wrong criminal-procedure precedent.  See generally Malloy,

378 U.S. 1.

															In addition, and significant to my analysis of this case, the origins and effects of the non-unanimous jury rule strongly support overruling Apodaca.  Louisiana achieved statehood in 1812.  And throughout most of the 1800s, the State required unanimous juries in criminal cases.  But at its 1898 state constitutional convention, Louisiana enshrined non-unanimous juries into the state constitution.  Why the change?  The State wanted to diminish the influence of black jurors, who had won the right to serve on juries through the
 
Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 and the Civil Rights Act of 1875.  See Strauder v. West Virginia,

100 U.S. 303, 308–310 (1880); T. Aiello, Jim Crow’s Last Stand: Nonunanimous Criminal Jury Verdicts in Louisiana 16, 19 (2015).  Coming on the heels of the State’s 1896 victory in Plessy v. Ferguson,

163 U.S. 537, the 1898 constitutional convention expressly sought to “establish the supremacy of the white race.”  Semmes, Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, Address at the Louisiana Constitutional Convention in 1898, in Official Journal of the Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Louisiana 375 (H. Hearsey ed. 1898).  And the convention approved non-unanimous juries as one pillar of a comprehensive and brutal program of racist Jim Crow measures against African-Americans, especially in voting and jury service.  See Aiello, supra, at 16–26; Frampton, The Jim Crow Jury, 71 Vand. L. Rev. 1593, 1620 (2018).[7]

															In light of the racist origins of the non-unanimous jury, it is no surprise that non-unanimous juries can make a difference in practice, especially in cases involving black defendants, victims, or jurors.  After all, that was the whole point of adopting the non-unanimous jury requirement in the first place.  And the math has not changed.  Then and now, non-unanimous juries can silence the voices and negate the votes of black jurors, especially in cases with black defendants or black victims, and only one or two black jurors.  The 10 jurors “can simply ignore the views of their fellow panel members of a different race or class.”  Johnson v. Louisiana,

406 U.S. 356, 397 (1972) (Stewart, J., dissenting). That reality—and the resulting perception of unfairness and racial bias—can undermine confidence in and respect for the criminal justice system.  The non-unanimous jury operates much the same as the unfettered peremptory challenge, a practice that for many decades likewise functioned as an engine of discrimination against black defendants, victims, and jurors.  In effect, the non-unanimous jury allows backdoor and unreviewable peremptory strikes against up to 2 of the 12 jurors.

															In its 1986 decision in Batson v. Kentucky, the Court recognized the pervasive racial discrimination woven into the traditional system of unfettered peremptory challenges.  See 476 U. S., at 85–89, 91.  The Court therefore overruled a prior decision, Swain v. Alabama,

380 U.S. 202 (1965), that had allowed those challenges. See generally Flowers v. Mississippi, 588 U. S. ___ (2019).

															In my view, Apodaca warrants the same fate as Swain.  After all, the “requirements of unanimity and impartial selection thus complement each other in ensuring the fair performance of the vital functions of a criminal court jury.”  Johnson, 406 U. S., at 398 (Stewart, J., dissenting).  And as Justice Thurgood Marshall forcefully explained in dissent in Apodaca, to “fence out a dissenting juror fences out a voice from the community, and undermines the principle on which our whole notion of the jury now rests.”  Johnson, 406 U. S., at 402 (Marshall, J., dissenting in both Johnson and Apodaca).

															To be clear, one could advocate for and justify a non-unanimous jury rule by resort to neutral and legitimate principles.  England has employed non-unanimous juries, and various legal organizations in the United States have at times championed non-unanimous juries.  See, e.g., Juries Act 1974, ch. 23, §17 (Eng.); ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Trial By Jury §1.1, p. 7 (App. Draft 1968); ALI, Code of Criminal Procedure §355, p. 99 (1930).   And Louisiana’s modern policy decision to retain non- unanimous juries—as distinct from its original decision in the late 1800s to adopt non-unanimous juries—may have been motivated by neutral principles (or just by inertia).

															But the question at this point is not whether the Constitution prohibits non-unanimous juries.  It does.  Rather, the disputed question here is whether to overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent that allowed non-unanimous juries.  And on that question—the question whether to overrule—the Jim Crow origins and racially discriminatory effects (and the perception thereof ) of non-unanimous juries in Louisiana and Oregon should matter and should count heavily in favor of overruling, in my respectful view.  After all, the non-unanimous jury “is today the last of Louisiana’s Jim Crow laws.”  Aiello, supra, at 63.  And this Court has emphasized time and again the “imperative to purge racial prejudice from the administration of justice” generally and from the jury system in particular.  Pena- Rodriguez v. Colorado, 580 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2017) (slip op., at 13–14) (collecting cases).

															To state the point in simple terms: Why stick by an erroneous precedent that is egregiously wrong as a matter of constitutional law, that allows convictions of some who would not be convicted under the proper constitutional rule, and that tolerates and reinforces a practice that is thoroughly racist in its origins and has continuing racially  discriminatory effects?

															Third, overruling Apodaca would not unduly upset reliance interests.  Only Louisiana and Oregon employ non-unanimous juries in criminal cases.  To be sure, in those two States, the Court’s decision today will invalidate some non-unanimous convictions where the issue is preserved and the case is still on direct review.  But that consequence almost always ensues when a criminal-procedure precedent that favors the government is overruled.  See Ring,

536 U.S. 584; Batson,

476 U.S. 79.  And here, at least, I would “count that a small price to pay for the uprooting of this weed.”  Hubbard, 514 U. S., at 717 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

															Except for the effects on that limited class of direct- review cases, it will be relatively easy going forward for Louisiana and Oregon to transition to the unanimous jury rule that the other 48 States and the federal courts use.  Indeed, in 2018, Louisiana amended its constitution to require jury unanimity in criminal trials for crimes committed on or after January 1, 2019, meaning that the transition is already well under way in Louisiana.

															Importantly, moreover, this Court applies a separate non-retroactivity doctrine to mitigate the disruptive effects of overrulings in criminal cases.  Under the Court’s precedents, new constitutional rules apply on direct review, but generally do not apply retroactively on habeas corpus review.  See Teague v. Lane,

489 U.S. 288, 311 (1989) (plurality opinion); Griffith v. Kentucky,

479 U.S. 314, 328 (1987).  Teague recognizes only two exceptions to that general habeas non-retroactivity principle: “if (1) the rule is substantive or (2) the rule is a ‘watershed rul[e] of criminal procedure’ implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.”  Whorton v. Bockting,

549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The new rule announced today—namely, that state criminal juries must be unanimous—does not fall within either of those two narrow Teague exceptions and therefore, as a matter of federal law, should not apply retroactively on habeas corpus review.

															The first Teague exception does not apply because today’s new rule is procedural, not substantive: It affects “only the manner of determining the defendant’s culpability.”  Schriro v. Summerlin,

542 U.S. 348, 353 (2004).

															The second Teague exception does not apply because today’s new rule, while undoubtedly important, is not a “watershed” procedural rule.  This Court has flatly stated that “it is unlikely that any such rules” have “yet to emerge.”  Whorton, 549 U. S., at 417 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In “the years since Teague, we have rejected every claim that a new rule satisfied the requirements for watershed status.”  Id., at 418, 421 (rejecting retroactivity for Crawford v. Washington,

541 U.S. 36 (2004)); see, e.g., Beard v. Banks,

542 U.S. 406, 420 (2004) (rejecting retroactivity for Mills v. Maryland,

486 U.S. 367 (1988)); Summerlin, 542 U. S., at 358 (rejecting retroactivity for Ring v. Arizona,

536 U.S. 584 (2002)); O’Dell v. Netherland,

521 U.S. 151, 167–168 (1997) (rejecting retroactivity for Simmons v. South Carolina,

512 U.S. 154 (1994)); Lambrix v. Singletary,

520 U.S. 518, 539–540 (1997) (rejecting retroactivity for Espinosa v. Florida,

505 U.S. 1079 (1992) (per curiam)); Sawyer v. Smith,

497 U.S. 227, 241–245 (1990) (rejecting retroactivity for Caldwell v. Mississippi,

472 U.S. 320 (1985)); see also Allen v. Hardy,

478 U.S. 255, 261 (1986) (per curiam) (rejecting retroactivity for Batson v. Kentucky,

476 U.S. 79 (1986)); DeStefano v. Woods,

392 U.S. 631, 635 (1968) (per curiam) (rejecting retroactivity for Duncan, 

391 U. S. 145).

															So assuming that the Court faithfully applies Teague, today’s decision will not apply retroactively on federal habeas corpus review and will not disturb convictions that are final.[8]

															In addition, as to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, an attorney presumably would not have been deficient for failing to raise a constitutional jury-unanimity argument before today’s decision—or at the very least, before the Court granted certiorari in this case.  Before today, after all, this Court’s precedents had repeatedly allowed non-unanimous juries in state criminal cases.  In that situation, the Courts of Appeals have consistently held that an attorney is not ineffective for failing to anticipate or advocate for the overruling of a constitutional precedent of this Court.  See, e.g., Walker v. United States, 810 F.3d 568, 577 (CA8 2016); United States v. Smith, 241 F.3d 546, 548 (CA7 2001); Honeycutt v. Mahoney, 698 F.2d 213, 216–217 (CA4 1983); see also Steiner v. United States, 940 F.3d 1282, 1293 (CA11 2019) (per curiam); Snider v. United States, 908 F.3d 183, 192 (CA6 2018); Green v. Johnson, 116 F.3d 1115, 1125 (CA5 1997).

															For those reasons, the reliance interests at stake in this case are not especially substantial, and they do not mandate adherence to Apodaca.[9]

															*  *  *

															In sum, Apodaca is egregiously wrong, it has significant negative consequences, and overruling it would not unduly upset reliance interests.  I therefore agree with the Court’s decision to overrule Apodaca.[10]
Notes
1
 In Casey, the Court reaffirmed what it described as the “central holding” of Roe v. Wade,

410 U.S. 113 (1973), the Court expressly rejected Roe’s trimester framework, and the Court expressly overruled two other important abortion precedents, Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc.,

462 U.S. 416 (1983), and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,

476 U.S. 747 (1986).  See Casey, 505 U. S., at 861; id., at 870, 873 (plurality opinion). 

2
 The Court’s precedents applying common-law statutes and pronouncing the Court’s own interpretive methods and principles typically do not fall within that category of stringent statutory stare decisis.  See Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc.,

551 U.S. 877, 899–907 (2007); Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2019) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 34–36). 

3
 The Court first used the term “special justification” in the stare decisis context in 1984, without explaining what the term might entail.  See Arizona v. Rumsey,

467 U.S. 203, 212.  In employing that term, the Court did not suggest that it was imposing a new stare decisis requirement as opposed to merely describing the Court’s historical practice with respect to stare decisis. 

4
 Another important factor that limits the number of overrulings is that the Court typically does not overrule a precedent unless a partyrequests overruling, or at least unless the Court receives briefing and argument on the stare decisis question. 

5
 To be clear, the stare decisis issue in this case is one of horizontal stare decisis—that is, the respect that this Court owes to its own precedents and the circumstances under which this Court may appropriately overrule a precedent.  By contrast, vertical stare decisis is absolute, as it must be in a hierarchical system with “one supreme Court.”  U. S. Const., Art III, §1.  In other words, the state courts and the other federal courts have a constitutional obligation to follow a precedent of this Courtunless and until it is overruled by this Court.  See Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,

490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989). 

6
 Notwithstanding the splintered 4–1–4 decision in Apodaca, its bottom-line result carried precedential force. In the American system of stare decisis, the result and the reasoning each independently have precedential force, and courts are therefore bound to follow both the result and the reasoning of a prior decision.  See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,

517 U.S. 44, 67 (1996); Randall v. Sorrell,

548 U.S. 230, 243 (2006) (opinion of Breyer, J.); County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,

492 U.S. 573, 668 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  The result of Apodaca was that state criminal juries need not be unanimous.  That precedential result has been followed by this Court and the other federal and state courts for the last 48 years.  To be sure, Apodaca had no majority opinion.  When the Court’s decision is splintered, courts follow the result, and they also follow the reasoning or standards set forth in the opinion constituting the “narrowest grounds” of the Justices in the majority.  See Marks v. United States,

430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977).  That Marks rule is ordinarily commonsensical to apply and usually means that courts in essence heed the opinion that occupies the middle-ground position between (i) the broadest opinion among the Justices in the majority and (ii) the dissenting opinion.  See United States v. Duvall, 740 F.3d 604, 610–611 (CADC 2013) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc).  On very rare occasions, as in Apodaca, it can be difficult to discern which opinion’s reasoning has precedential effect under Marks.  See also Nichols v. United States,

511 U.S. 738, 745–746 (1994) (analyzing Baldasar v. Illinois,

446 U.S. 222 (1980) (per curiam)).  But even when that happens, the result of the decision still constitutes a binding precedent for the federal and state courts, and for this Court, unless and until it is overruled by this Court.  As I read the Court’s various opinions today, six Justices treat the result in Apodaca as a precedent for purposes of stare decisis analysis.  A different group of six Justices concludes that Apodaca should be and is overruled.

 Oregon adopted the non-unanimous jury practice in 1934—one manifestation of the extensive 19th- and early 20th-century history of racist and anti-Semitic sentiment in that State.  See Kaplan & Saack, Overturning Apodaca v. Oregon Should Be Easy: Nonunanimous Jury Verdicts in Criminal Cases Undermine the Credibility of Our Justice System, 95 Ore. L. Rev. 1, 3, 43–51 (2016); Mooney, Remembering 1857, 87 Ore. L. Rev. 731, 778, n. 174 (2008). 

8
 In Allen v. Hardy,

478 U.S. 255 (1986) (per curiam), this Court concluded—without briefing or oral argument—that Batson would not apply retroactively.  Under the well-settled Teague principles, there should be no doubt that today’s decision likewise will not apply retroactively on collateral review. 

9
 Justice Alito’s characteristically incisive dissent rests largely on his view of the States’ reliance interests.  My respectful disagreement with Justice Alito primarily boils down to our different assessments of those reliance interests—in particular, our different evaluations of how readily Louisiana and Oregon can adjust to an overruling of Apodaca. 

10
 As noted above, I join the introduction and Parts I, II–A, III, and IV–B–1 of Justice Gorsuch’s opinion for the Court.  The remainder of Justice Gorsuch’s opinion does not command a majority.  That point is important with respect to Part IV–A, which only three Justices have joined.  It appears that six Justices of the Court treat the result in Apodaca as a precedent and therefore do not subscribe to the analysis in Part IV–A of Justice Gorsuch’s opinion.
