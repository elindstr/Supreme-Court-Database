															MARCUS DEANGELO JONES, PETITIONER v.
DEWAYNE HENDRIX, WARDEN

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the eighth circuit

															[June 22, 2023]

															Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															This case concerns the interplay between two
statutes: 28 U. S. C. §2241, the general habeas
corpus statute, and §2255, which provides an alternative
postconviction remedy for federal prisoners. Since 1948, Congress
has provided that a federal prisoner who collaterally attacks his
sentence ordinarily must proceed by a motion in the sentencing
court under §2255, rather than by a petition for a writ of
habeas corpus under §2241. To that end, §2255(e) bars a
federal prisoner from proceeding under §2241 “unless
. . . the [§2255] remedy by motion is inadequate or
ineffective to test the legality of his detention.”

															Separately, since the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), second or successive
§2255 motions are barred unless they rely on either
“newly discovered evidence,” §2255(h)(1), or
“a new rule of constitutional law,” §2255(h)(2). A
federal prisoner may not, therefore, file a second or successive
§2255 motion based solely on a more favorable interpretation
of statutory law adopted after his conviction became final and his
initial §2255 motion was resolved.

															The question presented is whether that
limitation on second or successive motions makes §2255
“inadequate or ineffective” such that the prisoner may
proceed with his statutory claim under §2241. We hold that it
does not.

															I

															In 2000, the U. S. District Court for the
Western District of Missouri convicted petitioner Marcus DeAngelo
Jones of two counts of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon,
in violation of 18 U. S. C. §922(g)(1), and one
count of making false statements to acquire a firearm, in violation
of §922(a)(6). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
affirmed his convictions and sentence of 327 months’
imprisonment. See United States v. Jones, 
266 F.3d 804 (2001). After losing his appeal, Jones filed a
timely §2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his
sentence, which resulted in the vacatur of one of his concurrent
§922(g) sentences but no other relief. See United
States v. Jones, 
403 F.3d 604 (CA8 2005); United States v. Jones,
185 Fed. Appx. 541 (CA8 2006) (per curiam).

															Years later, in Rehaif v. United
States, 588 U. S. ___ (2019), this Court held that a
defendant’s knowledge of the status that disqualifies him
from owning a firearm is an element of a §922(g) conviction.
In doing so, it abrogated the Eighth Circuit’s contrary
precedent, which the Western District of Missouri and the Eighth
Circuit had applied in Jones’ trial and direct appeal. See
Jones, 266 F. 3d, at 810, n. 5.

															After Rehaif, Jones hoped to leverage its
holding into a new collateral attack on his remaining §922(g)
conviction. But Rehaif ’s statutory holding
satisfied neither of §2255(h)’s gateway conditions for a
second or successive §2255 motion: It was neither “newly
discovered evidence,” §2255(h)(1), nor “a new rule
of constitutional law,” §2255(h)(2) (emphasis
added). Unable to file a new §2255 motion in his sentencing
court, Jones instead looked to §2255(e)’s “saving
clause,” which provides that a federal prisoner may file a
petition for a writ of habeas corpus under §2241 if—and
only if—§2255’s “remedy by motion is
inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his
detention.” Invoking this clause, Jones petitioned the
U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, the
district where he was imprisoned, for a writ of habeas corpus under
§2241.

															The District Court dismissed Jones’ habeas
petition for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and the Eighth
Circuit affirmed. 8 F. 4th 683 (2021). The Eighth Circuit
rejected Jones’ argument that the saving clause permits
recourse to §2241 to present a §2255(h)-barred claim
based on an intervening decision of statutory interpretation, as
well as his argument that foreclosing relief on his Rehaif
claim would violate the Suspension Clause, U. S. Const., Art.
I, §9, cl. 2. In doing so, the Eighth Circuit deepened a
split among the Courts of Appeals about whether prisoners in
Jones’ circumstances may resort to §2241 via the saving
clause.

															We granted certiorari. 596 U. S. ___
(2022). The Solicitor General then noticed her intent to defend the
Eighth Circuit’s judgment but not its rationale. We appointed
Morgan Ratner as amicus curiae to argue in support of the
Eighth Circuit’s reasoning. 597 U. S. ___ (2022). She
has ably discharged her responsibilities.

															II

															Consistent with the Eighth Circuit’s
reasoning, we hold that §2255(e)’s saving clause does
not permit a prisoner asserting an intervening change in statutory
interpretation to circumvent AEDPA’s restrictions on second
or successive §2255 motions by filing a §2241 petition.
We begin by considering the role of the saving clause in §2255
prior to AEDPA’s enactment. We then consider the impact of
AEDPA on the statutory scheme.

															A

															In relevant part, §2255 provides:

															“(a) A prisoner in custody under
sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the
right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed
in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or
that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or
that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law,
or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court
which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the
sentence.

															
.     .     .     .     .

															“(e) An application for a writ of habeas
corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for
relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained
if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by
motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has
denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion
is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his
detention.”

															In understanding this statutory text, “a
page of history is worth a volume of logic.” New York
Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U.S.
345, 349 (1921). Section 2255 is an outgrowth of the historic
habeas corpus powers of the federal courts as applied to the
special case of federal prisoners. The First Judiciary Act
authorized the federal courts “to grant writs of habeas
corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of
commitment,” with a proviso that such writs could
“extend to prisoners in gaol” only “where they
[were] in custody, under or by colour of the authority of the
United States, or [were] committed for trial before some court of
the same, or [were] necessary to be brought into court to
testify.” Act of Sept. 24, 1789, §14, 1 Stat. 82. In
1867, Congress expanded the federal courts’ habeas powers to
cover “all cases where any person may be restrained of his or
her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or
law of the United States.” Ch. 28, 14 Stat. 385. For most of
our Nation’s history, a federal prisoner “claiming the
right to be released,” §2255(a), in a collateral attack
on his sentence would have relied on these Acts and their
successors.

															That changed with the 1948 recodification and
reorganization of the Judiciary Code. See generally 62 Stat. 869.
In enacting the present Title 28 of the United States Code,
Congress largely recodified the federal courts’ pre-existing
habeas authority in §§2241 and 2243, which, respectively,
confer the power to grant the writ and direct the issuing court to
“dispose of the matter as law and justice require.”
Id., at 964–965. At the same time, however, Congress
created §2255 as a separate remedial vehicle specifically
designed for federal prisoners’ collateral attacks on their
sentences.[1] Id., at
967–968.

															The “sole purpose” of this
innovation, as this Court acknowledged a few years later,
“was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas
corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more
convenient forum.” United States v. Hayman,
342 U.S.
205, 219 (1952); see also Davis v. United States,
417
U.S. 333, 343 (1974) (“[Section] 2255 was intended to
afford federal prisoners a remedy identical in scope to federal
habeas corpus”); accord, United States v.
Addonizio, 442 U.S.
178, 185 (1979); Hill v. United States, 368 U.S.
424, 427 (1962). Experience had shown that processing federal
prisoners’ collateral attacks on their sentences through
habeas proceedings—and, therefore, through the judicial
districts in which they were confined—resulted in
“serious administrative problems.” Hayman, 342
U. S., at 212. Most significantly, a federal prisoner’s
district of confinement was often far removed from the records of
the sentencing court and other sources of needed evidence.
Id., at 212–213. These difficulties were
“greatly aggravated” by the concentration of federal
prisoners in a handful of judicial districts, which forced those
District Courts to process “an inordinate number of habeas
corpus actions.” Id., at 213–214.

															Section 2255 solved these problems by rerouting
federal prisoners’ collateral attacks on their sentences to
the courts that had sentenced them. To make this change of venue
effective, Congress generally barred federal prisoners
“authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to”
§2255 from applying “for a writ of habeas corpus”
under §2241. §2255(e). But, in a provision that has come
to be known as the saving clause, Congress preserved the habeas
remedy in cases where “the remedy by motion is inadequate or
ineffective to test the legality of [a prisoner’s]
detention.” Ibid.

															Traditionally, courts have treated the saving
clause as covering unusual circumstances in which it is impossible
or impracticable for a prisoner to seek relief from the sentencing
court. The clearest such circumstance is the sentencing
court’s dissolution; a motion in a court that no longer
exists is obviously “inadequate or ineffective” for any
purpose. See, e.g., Witham v. United States,

355 F.3d 501, 504–505 (CA6 2004) (finding §2255
inadequate or ineffective after court-martial was dissolved);
Edwards v. United States, 1987 WL 7562, *1 (EDNY,
Feb. 9, 1987) (finding §2255 inadequate or ineffective after
District Court of the Canal Zone was dissolved); cf.
Spaulding v. Taylor, 336 F.2d 192, 193 (CA10 1964)
(finding §2255 inadequate or ineffective after Alaska
territorial court was dissolved and federal and state successor
courts declined §2255 and state-habeas jurisdiction,
respectively). The saving clause might also apply when “it is
not practicable for the prisoner to have his motion determined in
the trial court because of his inability to be present at the
hearing, or for other reasons.”[2] Hayman, 342 U. S., at 215, n. 23
(internal quotation marks omitted).

															In addition, the saving clause ensures that
§2255(e) does not displace §2241 when a prisoner
challenges “the legality of his detention”
without attacking the validity of his sentence. To give a
few examples, a prisoner might wish to argue that he is being
detained in a place or manner not authorized by the sentence, that
he has unlawfully been denied parole or good-time credits, or that
an administrative sanction affecting the conditions of his
detention is illegal. See generally Samak v. Warden, FCC
Coleman–Medium, 766 F.3d 1271, 1280 (CA11 2014) (Pryor,
J., concurring) (explaining that “[t]he
‘detention’ of a prisoner encompasses much more than a
criminal ‘sentence’ ”). The briefs before us
debate whether these types of challenges depend on the saving
clause or proceed under §2241 “directly.” Compare
Brief for Petitioner 31 and Brief for Respondent 37–38 with
Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 17–18. It is
difficult to imagine a case in which this logical distinction would
make any practical difference. That said, were it not for the
saving clause, a literal reading of §2255(e) might be thought
to bar any “application for a writ of habeas corpus in
behalf of a [federal] prisoner,” §2255(e), whether or
not it challenged the “sentence . . .
imposed,” §2255(a). If nothing else, then, the saving
clause guards against the danger that §2255(e) might be
construed to bar manner-of-detention challenges even though they
are not within §2255’s substantive scope.

															B

															In 1996, Congress enacted AEDPA, which made
significant reforms to the process of federal-court postconviction
review for both state and federal prisoners. Most relevant here,
AEDPA strictly limited “second or successive”
§2255 motions to those that “contain—

															“(1) newly discovered evidence that, if
proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be
sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no
reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the
offense; or

															“(2) a new rule of constitutional law,
made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme
Court, that was previously unavailable.” §2255(h).

															Importantly, AEDPA left the text of
§2255(e) unchanged. But AEDPA’s new second-or-successive
restrictions indirectly gave rise to a novel application of the
saving clause.

															Mere months before AEDPA’s enactment, this
Court decided Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S.
137 (1995). That case interpreted the offense of
“us[ing]” a firearm “during and in relation to
any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,” in
violation of then-existing 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1),
more narrowly than many Circuits’ previous case law. See 516
U. S., at 142 (describing the Circuits’ approaches).
Under this Court’s §2255 precedent,
Bailey’s narrowing interpretation was grounds for a
collateral attack by federal prisoners who had been convicted under
the Courts of Appeals’ broader interpretations. See
Davis, 417 U. S., at 342–347 (holding a claim of
legal error based on an intervening change in statutory
interpretation cognizable under §2255). Many prisoners with
Bailey claims, however, had already exhausted their first
§2255 motion, and Bailey’s statutory holding
plainly did not satisfy either of §2255(h)’s conditions
for a second or successive motion.

															Several Courts of Appeals found a workaround for
those prisoners in the saving clause. With minor differences in
reasoning and wording, they held that §2255 was
“inadequate and ineffective” under the saving
clause—and that §2241 was therefore available—when
AEDPA’s second-or-successive restrictions barred a prisoner
from seeking relief based on a newly adopted narrowing
interpretation of a criminal statute that circuit precedent had
foreclosed at the time of the prisoner’s trial, appeal, and
first §2255 motion. This application of the saving clause took
shape in In re Dorsainvil, 
119 F.3d 245, 251 (CA3 1997); Triestman v. United
States, 
124 F.3d 361, 378–380 (CA2 1997); and In re
Davenport, 
147 F.3d 605, 609–611 (CA7 1998), and it was later
adopted by most of the other Circuits. See Ivy v.
Pontesso, 
328 F.3d 1057, 1059–1060 (CA9 2003); Martin v.
Perez, 
319 F.3d 799, 804–805 (CA6 2003);
Reyes–Requena v. United States, 
243 F.3d 893, 904 (CA5 2001); In re Jones,

226 F.3d 328, 333–334 (CA4 2000); Wofford v.
Scott, 
177 F.3d 1236, 1242–1245 (CA11 1999), overruled by
McCarthan v. Director of Goodwill
Industries–Suncoast, Inc., 851 F.3d 1076 (CA11 2017) (en
banc); but see Prost v. Anderson, 636 F.3d 578,
584–595 (CA10 2011) (Gorsuch, J.) (holding that §2255(e)
does not permit recourse to §2241 in these circumstances).

															We now hold that the saving clause does not
authorize such an end-run around AEDPA. In §2255(h), Congress
enumerated two—and only two—conditions in which a
second or successive §2255 motion may proceed. Because
§2255 is the ordinary vehicle for a collateral attack on a
federal sentence, the straightforward negative inference from
§2255(h) is that a second or successive collateral attack on a
federal sentence is not authorized unless one of those two
conditions is satisfied. See Jennings v. Rodriguez,
583 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 16)
(“ ‘The expression of one thing implies the
exclusion of others’ ” (quoting A. Scalia & B.
Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 107
(2012))). Even more directly, §2255(h)(2)’s
authorization of a successive collateral attack based on new rules
“of constitutional law” implies that Congress
did not authorize successive collateral attacks based on new rules
of nonconstitutional law. Had Congress wished to omit the
word “constitutional,” it easily could have done
so.

															The saving clause does not undermine this strong
negative inference. Basic principles of statutory interpretation
require that we construe the saving clause and §2255(h) in
harmony, not set them at cross-purposes. See, e.g.,
United States v. Fausto, 484
U.S. 439, 453 (1988); Bend v. Hoyt, 13 Pet. 263,
272 (1839) (Story, J.). That task is not difficult given the
distinct concerns of the two provisions. Subsection (h)
presumes—as part of its background—that federal
prisoners’ collateral attacks on their sentences are governed
by §2255, and it proceeds to specify when a second or
successive collateral attack is permitted. The saving clause
has nothing to say about that question. Rather, like subsection (e)
generally, it addresses the antecedent question of the relationship
between §§2241 and 2255.

															After AEDPA, as before it, the saving clause
preserves recourse to §2241 in cases where unusual
circumstances make it impossible or impracticable to seek relief in
the sentencing court, as well as for challenges to detention other
than collateral attacks on a sentence. Because AEDPA did not alter
the text of §2255(e), there is little reason to think that it
altered the pre-existing division of labor between §§2241
and 2255. AEDPA’s new restrictions on §2255, therefore,
are best understood as just that—restrictions on
§2255—not as expansions of §2241’s
applicability.

															Any other reading would make AEDPA curiously
self-defeating. It would mean that, by expressly excluding second
or successive §2255 motions based on nonconstitutional legal
developments, Congress accomplished nothing in terms of actually
limiting such claims. Instead, it would have merely rerouted them
from one remedial vehicle and venue to another. Stranger still,
Congress would have provided “a superior remedy”
for the very nonconstitutional claims it chose not to include in
§2255(h). McCarthan, 851 F. 3d, at 1091. After
escaping §2255 through the saving clause, nonconstitutional
claims would no longer be subject to AEDPA’s other express
procedural restrictions: the 1-year limitations period, see
§2255(f ), and the requirement that a prisoner obtain a
certificate of appealability before appealing an adverse decision
in the District Court, see §2253(c)(1).[3] We generally “resist attributing to
Congress an intention to render a statute so internally
inconsistent.” Greenlaw v. United States,
554 U.S.
237, 251 (2008).

															That resistance is particularly acute here,
where allowing nonconstitutional claims to proceed under §2241
would mean “resurrecting the very problems §2255 was
supposed to put to rest.” Wright v. Spaulding,
939 F.3d 695, 707 (CA6 2019) (Thapar, J., concurring). Section 2255
owes its existence to Congress’ pragmatic judgment that the
sentencing court, not the District Court for the district of
confinement, is the best venue for a federal prisoner’s
collateral attack on his sentence. Channeling a particular class of
second or successive attacks back into §2241 would mean once
again “[c]oncentrat[ing] ‘an inordinate number of
habeas corpus actions’ in districts with large prison
populations ” and requiring District Courts “to
review each other’s proceedings—often without access to
the witnesses, the sources of evidence, or other local information
that may be critical.” Id., at 707–708 (quoting
Hayman, 342 U. S., at 214). “The illogical
results of applying such an interpretation . . . argue
strongly against the conclusion that Congress intended these
results.” Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Board of
Equalization of S. D., 480 U.S.
123, 133 (1987).

															Here, as often is the case, the best
interpretation is the straightforward one. Section 2255(h)
specifies the two limited conditions in which Congress has
permitted federal prisoners to bring second or successive
collateral attacks on their sentences. The inability of a prisoner
with a statutory claim to satisfy those conditions does not mean
that he can bring his claim in a habeas petition under the saving
clause. It means that he cannot bring it at all. Congress has
chosen finality over error correction in his case.

															III

															Resisting this reading, Jones and the United
States both argue that §2255(h)’s exclusion of statutory
claims sometimes renders §2255 inadequate or ineffective,
though they advance different theories of when and why it does so.
Their arguments are unpersuasive.

															A

															Jones begins with a textual interpretation of
the saving clause that, if accepted, would convert §2255(e)
into a license for unbounded error correction. He argues that
§2255 is necessarily “inadequate or ineffective to
test” a prisoner’s claim if the §2255 court fails
to apply the correct substantive law. This argument ignores that
the saving clause is concerned with the adequacy or effectiveness
of the remedial vehicle (“the remedy by
motion”), not any court’s asserted errors of law. Cf.
Swain v. Pressley, 430 U.S.
372, 383 (1977) (holding a District of Columbia-court remedy
modeled on §2255 not to be “ ‘inadequate or
ineffective’ ” because the D. C. courts were
“competent to decide all issues”). Even when
“circuit law is inadequate or deficient” because
a Court of Appeals’ precedents have resolved a legal issue
incorrectly, that is not a fault in “the §2255 remedial
vehicle” itself.[4]
Prost, 636 F. 3d, at 590.

															Next, Jones offers a wide-ranging discussion of
the concept of “inadequacy” as a term of art in
traditional equity jurisprudence. While Jones demonstrates that
courts of equity would afford relief from “inadequate”
legal remedies in a broad range of circumstances, we find this
excursus irrelevant to the question presented here. To the extent
that Congress’ use of “inadequate” in the saving
clause harkens back to equity’s historic use of that term (an
issue we need not address), the most Jones’ evidence proves
is that a variety of circumstances might make it impracticable for
a prisoner to seek relief from the sentencing court.
Cf. Hayman, 342 U. S., at 215, n. 23. Nothing
in Jones’ survey of equity jurisprudence, however, even
begins to suggest that the saving clause offers an exemption from
AEDPA’s clear limits on second or successive collateral
attacks.

															Trying a different tack, Jones suggests that the
saving clause’s use of the present tense (“is
inadequate or ineffective”) means that §2241 is
available whenever a prisoner is presently unable to file a
§2255 motion. Even the Circuits with an expansive view of the
saving clause have uniformly rejected this argument, and for good
reason. See, e.g., In re Jones, 226 F. 3d,
at 333; Dorsainvil, 119 F. 3d, at 251. Were this
argument accepted, AEDPA’s changes to §2255 would be
entirely futile, as §2241 would be available any time
the second-or-successive restrictions precluded relief. We decline
to infer that Congress intended AEDPA’s carefully crafted
limits on collateral relief under §2255 to be mere
nullities.

															As a backstop to his scattershot textual
arguments, Jones invokes the constitutional-doubt canon, arguing
that denying him the chance to raise his Rehaif claim in a
§2241 petition raises serious constitutional questions. It
does not.[5]

															Jones’ primary constitutional argument is
that denying him any opportunity to seek postconviction relief
based on Rehaif would violate the Suspension Clause, which
provides that “[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus
shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or
Invasion the public Safety may require it.” U. S.
Const., Art. I, §9, cl. 2. This “Suspension Clause
argument fails because it would extend the writ of habeas corpus
far beyond its scope ‘when the Constitution was drafted and
ratified.’ ” Department of Homeland
Security v. Thuraissigiam, 591 U. S. ___, ___
(2020) (slip op., at 2) (quoting Boumediene v. Bush,
553 U.S.
723, 746 (2008)). When the Suspension Clause was adopted, and
for a long time afterward, Jones’ Rehaif claim would
not have been cognizable in habeas at all.

															At the founding, a sentence after conviction
“by a court of competent jurisdiction” was
“ ‘in itself sufficient
cause’ ” for a prisoner’s continued
detention. Brown v. Davenport, 596 U. S. ___,
___ (2022) (slip op., at 8) (quoting Ex parte Watkins, 3
Pet. 193, 202 (1830)). As Chief Justice Marshall explained in the
seminal case of Ex parte Watkins, the criminal
judgment, “in its nature, conclude[d] the subject on which it
[was] rendered,” “pronounce[d] the law of the
case,” and “pu[t] an end to the inquiry concerning
fact.” Id., at 202–203. Of particular relevance
here, a habeas court had no power to “look beyond the
judgment” to “re-examine the charges on which it was
rendered” for substantive errors of law—even “if
. . . the [sentencing] court ha[d] misconstrued the law,
and ha[d] pronounced an offence to be punishable criminally, which
[was] not so.” Id., at 202, 209.

															In rebuttal, Jones argues that pre-founding
practice did allow habeas courts to “look beyond the
judgment” to ensure that the convicting court had proved
every element of the crime for which a prisoner was committed. But
Jones fails to identify a single clear case of habeas being used to
relitigate a conviction after trial by a court of general criminal
jurisdiction. Rather, the cases he cites mostly involve commitments
by justices of the peace,[6] a
distinction reflected in Watkins itself. See id., at
208 (discussing Ex parte Burford, 3 Cranch 448, 453 (1806),
where the Court examined on habeas the sufficiency of a warrant of
commitment by justices of the peace while noting that no judgment
of a federal court was in question). At common law, justices of the
peace were not courts of record and did not possess general
criminal jurisdiction. Capital Traction Co. v. Hof,
174 U.S.
1, 16–17 (1899); see also United States v.
Mills, 11 App. D. C. 500, 507 (1897). As such, their
commitments were “not placed on the same high ground with the
judgments of a court of record,” and the fact that superior
courts sometimes used habeas to examine commitments by such
inferior magistrates furnishes “no authority for inquiring
into the judgments of a court of general criminal
jurisdiction.” Watkins, 3 Pet., at 209.

															Jones also appeals to Bushell’s
Case, Vaugh. 135, 124 Eng. Rep. 1006 (C. P. 1670), which
has long been understood as a case about the independence of
criminal juries in determining questions of fact. Clark v.
United States, 289 U.S.
1, 16–17 (1933); see also Sparf v. United
States, 156 U.S.
51, 90–93 (1895); 1 J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal
Law of England 375 (1883) (Stephen). There, a judge fined and
imprisoned the members of a jury for acquitting William Penn and
William Mead on indictments for “assembling unlawfully and
tumultuously,” a verdict ostensibly against the
“manifest evidence.” Vaugh., at 137, 124 Eng. Rep., at
1007. A juror refused to pay the fine, applied to the Court of
Common Pleas for a writ of habeas corpus, and obtained discharge in
an opinion by Chief Justice Vaughn. Jones points to one part of
Vaughn’s opinion, which criticized the return of the writ for
not specifying that the jurors “kn[e]w and believe[d] th[e]
evidence to be full and manifest against the indicted
persons,” without which the jurors’ verdict was
“no cause of fine or imprisonment.” Id., at 142,
124 Eng. Rep., at 1009. Jones asks us to read this passage as
reflecting a supposed common-law rule that habeas relief was
available whenever a convicting court had not found the necessary
mens rea of a crime. That reading, however, entirely misses
the actual basis of Vaughn’s opinion, which was the
judge’s absolute want of power to question the
jury’s determination of the facts. See id., at 149,
124 Eng. Rep., at 1013 (“It is absurd a jury should be fined
by the Judge for going against their evidence, when he who fineth
knows not what it is . . . . [I]f it be demanded,
what is the fact? the Judge cannot answer it”); see also
Stephen 375 (“[T]he judges who heard the argument
. . . decided that the discretion of the jury to believe
the evidence or not could not be questioned”). Thus,
Bushell’s Case no more undermines Watkins than
do the justice-of-the-peace cases.

															The principles of Watkins guided this
Court’s understanding of the habeas writ throughout the 19th
century and well into the 20th. See Brown, 596 U. S.,
at ___, n. 1 (slip op., at 9, n. 1) (collecting cases);
see also Johnson v. Zerbst, 304
U.S. 458, 465–466 (1938). Even in Ex parte
Siebold, 100 U.S.
371 (1880), which held that the constitutionality of a
prisoner’s statute of conviction could be reviewed on habeas
(as going to jurisdiction),[7]
the Court acknowledged Watkins and took pains to reconcile
its holding with the traditional rule. See 100 U. S., at
375–377. And, when asked to review convicting courts’
substantive errors of statutory law in habeas corpus
proceedings, this Court consistently held that it could not do
so.[8] It was not until 1974,
in Davis, that the Court broke with that tradition, holding
for the first time that a substantive error of statutory law could
be a cognizable ground for a collateral attack on a federal
court’s criminal judgment. See 417 U. S., at
342–347.

															The Suspension Clause does not constitutionalize
that innovation of nearly two centuries later. Nor,
a fortiori, does it require the extension of that
innovation to a second or successive collateral attack.

															Jones’ remaining constitutional arguments
are no more persuasive. He argues that denying him a new
opportunity for collateral review of his Rehaif claim
threatens separation-of-powers principles—specifically,
Congress’ exclusive power to define crimes Cf. United
States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812). But the
authority to determine the facts and the law in an individual case,
and to render a final, binding judgment based on those
determinations, stands at the core of the judicial power. See
Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S.
211, 218–219 (1995); Watkins, 3 Pet., at
202–203. A court does not usurp legislative power simply by
misinterpreting the law in a given case. See id., at 206
(“If its judgment was erroneous, a point which this court
does not determine, still it is a judgment”).

															Next, Jones points to Fiore v.
White, 531 U.S.
225 (2001) (per curiam), which applied the rule that due
process requires that the prosecution prove every element of a
crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See id., at 228–229.
Whether a due process error has occurred at trial, however,
is an entirely different issue from Congress’ power to
restrict collateral review. Due process does not guarantee a direct
appeal, McKane v. Durston, 153
U.S. 684, 687 (1894), let alone the opportunity to have legal
issues redetermined in successive collateral attacks on a final
sentence.

															Jones’ last constitutional
contention—that the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on
cruel and unusual punishments may entitle him to another round of
collateral review—fails for a similar reason. By its terms,
the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause expresses a substantive
constraint on the kinds of punishments governments may
“inflic[t].” It creates no freestanding entitlement to
a second or successive round of postconviction review, and thus it
adds nothing to Jones’ unavailing Suspension Clause
argument.

															B

															The Government agrees with the Eighth Circuit
that Jones is not entitled to relief, but, somewhat surprisingly,
it asks us to adopt a novel, alternative interpretation of the
saving clause, which it constructs via a roundabout argument. It
begins with the premise that the words “inadequate or
ineffective” imply reference to a “benchmark” of
adequacy and effectiveness. It proceeds to identify that benchmark
as the ability to test the types of claims cognizable under the
general habeas statutes—specifically, those governing federal
habeas petitions by state prisoners. The Government then
reasons that §2255(h)’s limitations on second or
successive motions asserting newly discovered evidence or new rules
of constitutional law do not trigger the saving clause because
Congress has imposed analogous limitations on analogous claims by
state prisoners and—by doing so—has redefined
§2255(e)’s implicit habeas benchmark with respect to
such “factual” and “constitutional” claims.
See 28 U. S. C. §§2244(b)(2)(A)–(B).
Since, the Government asserts, Congress has imposed no analogous
limitation on statutory claims by state prisoners, it has not
redefined the implicit habeas benchmark with respect to statutory
claims like Jones’. And, we should be unwilling to infer that
AEDPA limited such claims without a clearer textual indication. The
Government concludes that §2255(h) renders §2255
“inadequate or ineffective to test” a federal
prisoner’s statutory claim in cases where the prisoner has
already filed one §2255 motion and the claim otherwise
satisfies pre-AEDPA habeas principles, which generally will require
“a ‘colorable showing of factual
innocence.’ ” McCleskey v. Zant,
499 U.S.
467, 495 (1991) (quoting Kuhlmann v. Wilson,
477 U.S.
436, 454 (1986) (plurality opinion)).[9]

															This elaborate theory is no more convincing than
Jones’ arguments. Its most striking flaw is the seemingly
arbitrary linkage it posits between the saving clause and state
prisoners’ statutory postconviction remedies. While it is
true that §2255, as enacted, afforded the same rights
federal prisoners previously enjoyed under the general
habeas statutes, see Hayman, 342 U. S., at 219, nothing
in §2255’s text, structure, or history suggests that
Congress intended any part of it to implicitly cross-reference
whatever modifications to state prisoners’
postconviction remedies might be made in the future. Understanding
the saving clause to do so would have highly counterintuitive
implications: On the Government’s view,
§§2255(h)(1) and (h)(2) do not create an adequacy or
effectiveness problem only because of the parallel
state-prisoner provisions in §2244(b). It seems to follow that
if Congress relaxed §2244(b)’s second-or-successive
restrictions for state prisoners tomorrow, and did nothing else,
§2255 would suddenly become “inadequate or ineffective
to test” at least some second or successive fact-based claims
that did not satisfy §2255(h)(1) or constitutional claims that
did not satisfy §2255(h)(2), and that those claims would then
be allowed to proceed under §2241. We see no indication that
the spare language of the saving clause creates such a Rube
Goldberg contrivance, whereby changes to other statutory provisions
(which do not apply to federal prisoners at all) could flow back
into §2255 and undermine §2255(h).

															In any event, as the Government acknowledges, a
state prisoner could never bring a pure statutory-error claim in
federal habeas, because “ ‘federal habeas corpus
relief does not lie for errors of state law.’ ”
Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S.
62, 67 (1991) (quoting Lewis v. Jeffers,
497 U.S.
764, 780 (1990)). As a result, it is unclear what work the
Government’s state-prisoner-habeas benchmark is even doing in
its answer to the question presented here.

															Rather, the narrow base on which the
Government’s top-heavy theory ultimately turns out to rest is
its assertion that §2255(h) is simply not clear enough
to support the inference that Congress entirely closed the door on
pure statutory claims not brought in a federal prisoner’s
initial §2255 motion. See Brief for Respondent 28–29,
39. That assertion is unpersuasive for the reasons we have already
explained: §2255(h) specifies the two circumstances in which a
second or successive collateral attack on a federal sentence is
available, and those circumstances do not include an intervening
change in statutory interpretation.

															The Government asserts that we require
“the clearest command” before construing AEDPA to
“close [the] courthouse doors” on “a strong
equitable claim” for relief. Holland v.
Florida, 560 U.S.
631, 646, 649 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The
only two cases the Government relies on for its clear-statement
rule do not sweep as broadly as it suggests. In Holland, we
applied the general presumption of equitable tolling to
AEDPA’s 1-year statute of limitations for state
prisoners’ habeas claims. Id., at 645–649.
Afterward, in McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S.
383 (2013), we held that “a convincing showing of actual
innocence” could enable a prisoner to evade AEDPA’s
statute of limitations entirely. Id., at 386.

															Undoubtedly, McQuiggin’s assertion
of equitable authority to override clear statutory text was a bold
one. But even taking Holland and McQuiggin for all
they are worth, there is a significant difference between reading
equitable exceptions into a statute of limitations, on the one
hand, and demanding a clear statement before foreclosing
workarounds to AEDPA’s second-or-successive restrictions, on
the other. Statutes of limitations merely govern the
timeframe for bringing a claim. AEDPA’s
second-or-successive restrictions, by contrast, “constitute a
modified res judicata rule,” Felker v. Turpin,
518 U.S.
651, 664 (1996), and thus embody Congress’ judgment
regarding the central policy question of postconviction
remedies—the appropriate balance between finality and error
correction. Insisting on a heightened standard of clarity in this
context would effectively mean adopting a presumption against
finality as a substantive value. We decline to do so. “[T]he
United States has an interest in the finality of sentences imposed
by its own courts,” Johnson v. United States,
544 U.S.
295, 309 (2005), and how to balance that interest against error
correction is a “judgmen[t] about the proper scope of the
writ” that is “ ‘normally for Congress to
make.’ ” Felker, 518 U. S., at 664
(quoting Lonchar v. Thomas, 517
U.S. 314, 323 (1996)).

															Accepting the Government’s proposal to
apply a clear-statement rule would be particularly anomalous in
light of the precise question this case presents. Typically, we
find clear-statement rules appropriate when a statute implicates
historically or constitutionally grounded norms that we would not
expect Congress to unsettle lightly. See, e.g., Alabama
Assn. of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human
Servs., 594 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (per curiam)
(slip op., at 6) (presumption that Congress does not casually
assign executive agencies “powers of vast economic and
political significance” or “significantly alter the
balance between federal and state power” (internal quotation
marks omitted)); Landgraf v. USI Film Products,
511 U.S.
244, 265–266 (1994) (presumption against statutory
retroactivity); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,
473 U.S.
234, 243 (1985) (presumption against abrogation of state
sovereign immunity). But, as shown above in discussing Jones’
Suspension Clause argument, there is no historical or
constitutional norm of permitting one convicted of a crime by a
court of competent jurisdiction to collaterally attack his sentence
based on an alleged error of substantive statutory law. As far as
history and the Constitution are concerned, “there is nothing
incongruous about a system in which this kind of error—the
application of a since-rejected statutory
interpretation—cannot be remedied after final
judgment.” George v. McDonough, 596 U. S.
___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 10). A fortiori, there is
nothing fundamentally surprising about Congress declining to make
such errors remediable in a second or successive collateral
attack.

															We affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 As first enacted,
§2255 applied to any “prisoner in custody under sentence
of a court of the United States.” 62 Stat. 967. In 1949,
Congress substituted “court established by Act of
Congress” for “court of the United States,”
making no other changes. §114, 63 Stat. 105 (internal
quotation marks omitted). Section 2255 was not again amended until
AEDPA, and the only post-AEDPA amendment simply added the current
lettering and numbering to what were previously undesignated
paragraphs. Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, §511, 121
Stat. 2545. For simplicity, we use §2255’s current
internal designations throughout this opinion.
2
 It bears mentioning that
§2255 was enacted “eight years before President
Eisenhower signed legislation funding the Interstate Highway
System.” Brief for Court-Appointed Amicus Curiae 17.
At that time, it would not be surprising if removing a prisoner
from the penitentiary, transporting him to the sentencing court for
a hearing, and taking him back to prison again sometimes posed
difficulties daunting enough to make a §2255 proceeding
practically unavailable. Cf. Stidham v. Swope, 82 F.
Supp. 931, 932–933 (ND Cal. 1949) (describing the difficulty
and delay involved in transporting a prisoner “upwards of
1,500 miles” from the federal penitentiary in Alcatraz to the
sentencing court in Missouri, a journey that “well could be
two weeks” by rail). That this sort of practical inadequacy
would be highly unusual today should not blind us to the world in
which Congress was legislating when it enacted the saving
clause.
3
 It is no answer to say
that the saving clause must apply sometimes and that these
procedural restrictions are inapplicable whenever it does. Cf.
Reply Brief for Petitioner 12; Reply Brief for Respondent
9–10. Allowing second or successive nonconstitutional claims
to circumvent §2255(h) under the saving clause would confer
favored treatment for nonconstitutional claims as a class, a
result directly at odds with the manifest tenor of
§2255(h).
4
 Despite occasional
gestures in its direction, and despite its critical role in
persuading the Courts of Appeals to expand the saving clause,
Jones’ textual arguments place relatively little emphasis on
whether binding precedent foreclosed a prisoner’s statutory
argument at trial, on appeal, and in an initial §2255 motion.
See In re Davenport, 
147 F.3d 605, 610–611 (CA7 1998) (making such foreclosure
an express precondition of saving-clause relief ); see also
Triestman v. United States, 
124 F.3d 361, 380 (CA2 1997) (emphasizing that the prisoner
“had no [prior] effective opportunity to raise his
[Bailey] claim”); In re Dorsainvil,

119 F.3d 245, 251 (CA3 1997) (similar). Rather, under
Jones’ interpretation of “test,” it appears that
§2241 would be available to correct any asserted error
of law by a §2255 court, even on an issue of first impression.
Untenable as that consequence is, the erroneous-foreclosure
approach fares no better. To hold that binding precedent renders a
judicial proceeding “ ‘inadequate or
ineffective’ to test the rights of parties” would be a
shock for “our entire justice system,” in which
“precedent is ubiquitous.” Wright v.
Spaulding, 939 F.3d 695, 709 (CA6 2019) (Thapar, J.,
concurring). Nothing in the text or history of the saving clause
suggests that it uniquely embodies that far-reaching
proposition.
5
 As Court-appointed
amicus curiae observes, Jones’ use of the
constitutional-doubt canon is somewhat anomalous, in that it aims
at a different result from what a direct constitutional challenge
would achieve. If a prisoner persuaded a court that the exclusion
of statutory claims from §2255(h) was unconstitutional, the
result would not be that he could proceed under §2241, but
simply that he could file a second or successive §2255 motion
on an equal footing with §§2255(h)(1) and 2255(h)(2)
claims.
6
 See Rex v.
Brown, 8 T. R. 26, 101 Eng. Rep. 1247 (1798); Rex v.
Hall, 1 Cowp. 60, 98 Eng. Rep. 967 (1774); Rex v.
Hall, 3 Burr. 1636, 97 Eng. Rep. 1022 (1765); Rex v.
Collier, 1 Wils. K. B. 332, 95 Eng. Rep. 647 (1752). The
cursory report in Rex v. Catherall, 2 Str. 900,
93 Eng. Rep. 967 (1730), is silent as to the authority under which
the petitioner was convicted, and so cannot help Jones overcome
Watkins.
7
 The Court seemingly
abandoned that notion in Glasgow v. Moyer, 225 U.S.
420 (1912), which explained that “[t]he principle”
that nonjurisdictional errors of substantive law are not cognizable
in habeas “is not the less applicable because the law which
was the foundation of the indictment and trial is asserted to be
unconstitutional . . . . [I]f a court has
jurisdiction of the case the writ of habeas corpus cannot be
employed to re-try the issues, whether of law, constitutional or
otherwise, or of fact.” Id., at 429 (emphasis
added).
8
 See, e.g.,
Knewel v. Egan, 268 U.S.
442, 446 (1925) (“It is fundamental that a court upon
which is conferred jurisdiction to try an offense has jurisdiction
to determine whether or not that offense is charged or
proved”); In re Gregory, 219
U.S. 210, 213 (1911) (“[W]e are not concerned with the
question whether the information was sufficient or whether the acts
set forth in the agreed statement constituted a crime, that is to
say, whether the court properly applied the law, if it be found
that the court had jurisdiction to try the issues and to render the
judgment”); In re Eckart, 166
U.S. 481, 483 (1897) (explaining that habeas would not offer
relief from “a trial and conviction upon an indictment, the
facts averred in which are asserted to be insufficient to
constitute an offence against the statute claimed to have been
violated”); Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S.
651, 654 (1884) (“Whether the indictment sets forth in
comprehensive terms the offence which the statute describes and
forbids . . . is in every case a question of law
. . . within [the trial court’s]
jurisdiction”); Ex parte Parks, 93 U.S.
18, 20–21 (1876) (“It would be an assumption of
authority for this court, by means of the writ of habeas
corpus, to review every case in which the defendant attempts to
controvert the criminality of the offence charged in the
indictment”). Ignoring this authority, Justice
Jackson’s dissent cites a handful of inapposite cases to
suggest that 19th-century American courts would have treated claims
such as Jones’ as cognizable in habeas. See post, at
31–32, n. 19, 34, 36–37, n. 25. Grant
v. United States, 58 F. 694 (CA9 1893), was a case on a writ
of error, not habeas corpus. Ex parte D’Olivera,
7 F. Cas. 853 (No. 3,967) (CC Mass. 1813), was another
justice-of-the-peace case. Ex parte Randolph, 20 F.
Cas. 242, 254 (No. 11,558) (CC Va. 1833), involved detention
unsupported by any “judgment” or “judicial
process” whatsoever. United States v.
Bainbridge, 24 F. Cas. 946 (No. 14,497) (CC Mass. 1816),
involved a collateral attack on a sentence imposed by a naval court
martial; Justice Story’s opinion turned on the validity of
the petitioner’s contract of enlistment, which, in turn, went
to the court martial’s jurisdiction. Id., at
949–952; see also Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet 193,
209 (1830); Wise v. Withers, 3 Cranch 331, 337
(1806). Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75 (1807), relieved two
alleged traitors from pretrial orders of commitment on the ground
that there was “not sufficient evidence . . . to
justify [their] commitment on the charge of treason.”
Id., at 135. Matter of Corryell, 22 Cal. 178 (1863),
granted relief from a pretrial order of commitment after holding
that the acts of which the petitioner stood accused did not
constitute the charged crime. Id., at 180, 183.
(Incidentally, this use of habeas was not free from controversy.
See, e.g., In re Hacker, 73 F. 464,
465–469 (SD Cal. 1896); “In re
Kearney,” The Writ of Habeas Corpus—Its Uses and
Abuses, 5 Pac. Coast L. J. 549, 565–570 (1880).)
Finally, In re Wahll, 42 F. 822 (D. Minn. 1890),
considered but rejected a similar argument for ordering pretrial
release. Id., at 824–826. In sum, like Jones’
pre-founding English cases, the dissent’s 19th-century
American cases include no example in which a prisoner under
sentence of a court of general criminal jurisdiction was permitted
to relitigate the elements of his offense on habeas
corpus.
9
 The Government also
argues that Davis v. United States, 417 U.S.
333 (1974), and Sunal v. Large, 332 U.S.
174 (1947), read together, dictate that only an intervening
decision of this Court, rather than a Court of Appeals, can
work such a change in the law as to justify an otherwise-barred
§2241 petition. But this attempt to articulate an additional
limiting principle for the Government’s theory requires
turning the cases inside out. In Davis, where this Court
allowed a statutory claim to proceed under §2255, the relevant
narrowing decision came from the Ninth Circuit. See 417 U. S.,
at 341 (discussing United States v. Fox, 454 F.2d 593
(CA9 1971)). In Sunal, where two petitioners’
statutory claims were barred from proceeding in habeas, it was this
Court that had issued the relevant decision. See 332 U. S., at
176 (discussing Estep v. United States, 327 U.S.
114 (1946)). As we have recognized, see Reed v.
Farley, 512 U.S.
339, 354 (1994), the holding of Sunal rested on what we
would today call the petitioners’ procedural default without
cause: By not appealing their convictions, they had forfeited the
argument that ended up prevailing in Estep, and they had
shown no “exceptional circumstances which excuse[d] their
failure” to appeal. 332 U. S., at 183–184. The
Sunal Court thus had no occasion to definitively resolve
whether the petitioners’ claims would have been cognizable in
habeas but for their default. And, to the extent Sunal
addressed that question in dicta, it appeared to be of two minds.
See id., at 181–183 (suggesting, in a single
unelaborated sentence, that the petitioners’ “cases
would be quite different” had they appealed and lost, then
spending two paragraphs emphasizing that the trial courts’
“error of law” was neither jurisdictional nor
constitutional).
