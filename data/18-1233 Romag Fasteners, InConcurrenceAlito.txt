															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															ROMAG FASTENERS, INC., PETITIONER v. FOSSIL, INC., et al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit

															[April 23, 2020]

															

															Justice Alito, with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan join, concurring.

															We took this case to decide whether willful infringement is a prerequisite to an award of profits under

15 U. S. C. §1117(a).  The decision below held that willfulness is such a prerequisite.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.  That is incorrect.  The relevant authorities, particularly pre-Lanham Act case law, show that willfulness is a highly important consideration in awarding profits under §1117(a), but not an absolute precondition.  I would so hold and concur on that ground.
