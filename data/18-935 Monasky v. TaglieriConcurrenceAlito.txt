															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															MICHELLE MONASKY, PETITIONER v. DOMENICO TAGLIERI

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit

															[February 25, 2020]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

															I agree with the Court on almost all the issues in this case.  Specifically, I agree (1) that analysis of the question of “habitual residence” should be based on a range of factors and should be attentive to the particular facts of each case, (2) that a child may have a habitual residence in a country without a parental agreement to that effect, (3) that our interpretation of habitual residence should take into account the interpretations of other signatory nations, (4) that a district court’s decision on habitual residence is entitled to deference on appeal, and (5) that the judgment below should be affirmed.  I also agree with Justice Thomas that we must independently interpret the meaning of “habitual residence.”

															So what does it mean?  The term “habitual” is used to refer to a cluster of related concepts.  It can be used to refer to things done by habit, as well as things that are “constantly repeated or continued,” “usual,” or “accustomed.”  6 Oxford English Dictionary 996 (2d ed. 1989); see also Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1017 (1976).  If taken in isolation, each of these understandings might lead to a different analysis in applying the concept of “habitual residence” under the Convention.  See Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Oct. 25, 1980, T. I. A. S. No. 11670, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99–11.  But I think the Court accurately captures what the term means under the Convention when it says that a child’s habitual residence is the child’s “home.”  Ante, at 8, 10, 15.

															Of course the concept of “home” is also multifaceted.  It can be used to signify the place where a person generally sleeps, eats, works, and engages in social and recreational activities, but it can also mean the place where a person feels most comfortable and the place to which the person has the strongest emotional ties.  See 7 Oxford English Dictionary, at 322–323; Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, at 1082.  As best I can determine, the concept of “habitual residence” under the Convention embraces all of these meanings to some degree.  If forced to try to synthesize them, I would say it means the place where the child in fact has been living for an extended period—unless that place was never regarded as more than temporary or there is another place to which the child has a strong attachment.  I think this is the core of what courts have made of the concept of “habitual residence,” and it appears to represent the best distillation of the various shades of meaning of the term taken in context.

															So interpreted, “habitual residence” is not a pure question of fact, at least as we understand that concept in our legal system.  But it does involve a heavily factual inquiry.  For these reasons, I would say that the standard of review on appeal is abuse of discretion, not clear error.  As a practical matter, the difference may be no more than minimal.  The important point is that great deference should be afforded to the District Court’s determination.
