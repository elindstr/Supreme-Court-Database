															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															No. 11–1085

															AMGEN INC., et al., PETITIONERS v.
CONNECTICUT RETIREMENT PLANS AND TRUST FUNDS

															on writ of certiorari to the united states
court of appeals for the ninth circuit

															[February 27, 2013]

															

															Justice Alito, concurring.

															I join the opinion of the Court with the
understanding that the petitioners did not ask us to revisit
Basic’s fraud-on-the-market presumption. See Basic
Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S.
224 (1988). As the dissent observes, more re- cent evidence
suggests that the presumption may rest on a faulty economic
premise. Post, at 4, n. 4 (opinion of Thomas, J.); see
Langevoort, Basic at Twenty: Rethinking Fraud on the Market,
2009 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 175–176. In light of this
development, reconsideration of the Basic presumption may be
appropriate.
