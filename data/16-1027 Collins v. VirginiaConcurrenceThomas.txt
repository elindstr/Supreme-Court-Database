															SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

															RYAN AUSTIN COLLINS, PETITIONER v. VIRGINIA

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of virginia

															[May 29, 2018]

															

															Justice Thomas, concurring.

															I join the Court’s opinion because it correctly resolves the
 
Fourth Amendment question in this case.  Notably, the only reason that Collins asked us to review this question is because, if he can prove a violation of the
 
Fourth Amendment, our precedents require the Virginia courts to apply the exclusionary rule and potentially suppress the incriminating evidence against him.  I write separately because I have serious doubts about this Court’s authority to impose that rule on the States.  The assumption that state courts must apply the federal exclusionary rule is legally dubious, and many jurists have complained that it encourages “distort[ions]” in substantive
 
Fourth Amendment law, Rakas v. Illinois,

439 U. S. 128, 157 (1978) (White, J., dissenting); see also Coolidge v. New Hampshire,

403 U. S. 443, 490 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring); Calabresi, The Exclusionary Rule, 26 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol’y 111, 112 (2003).

															The
 
Fourth Amendment, as relevant here, protects the people from “unreasonable searches” of “their . . . houses.”  As a general rule, warrantless searches of the curtilage violate this command.  At the founding, curtilage was considered part of the “hous[e]” itself.  See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 225 (1769) (“[T]he capital house protects and privileges all its branches and appurtenants, if within the curtilage”).  And except in circumstances not present here, house searches required a specific warrant.  See W. Cuddihy, The
 
Fourth Amendment: Origins and Original Meaning 602–1791, p. 743 (2009) (Cuddihy); Donahue, The Original
 
Fourth Amendment, 83 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1181, 1237–1240 (2016); Davies, Recovering the Original
 
Fourth Amendment, 98 Mich. L. Rev. 547, 643–646 (1999).  A warrant was required even if the house was being searched for stolen goods or contraband—objects that, unlike cars, are not protected by the
 
Fourth Amendment at all.  Id., at 647–650; see also Carroll v. United States,

267 U. S. 132, 150–152 (1925) (Taft, C. J.) (discussing founding-era evidence that a search warrant was required when stolen goods and contraband were “concealed in a dwelling house” but not when they were “in course of transportation and concealed in a movable vessel”).  Accordingly, the police acted “unreasonabl[y]” when they searched the curtilage of Collins’ house without a warrant.[1]

															While those who ratified the Fourth and
 
Fourteenth Amendments would agree that a constitutional violation occurred here, they would be deeply confused about the posture of this case and the remedy that Collins is seeking.  Historically, the only remedies for unconstitutional searches and seizures were “tort suits” and “self-help.”  Utah v. Strieff, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 4).  The exclusionary rule—the practice of deterring illegal searches and seizures by suppressing evidence at criminal trials—did not exist.  No such rule existed in “Roman Law, Napoleonic Law or even the Common Law of England.”  Burger, Who Will Watch the Watchman? 14 Am. U. L. Rev. 1 (1964).  And this Court did not adopt the federal exclusionary rule until the 20th century.  See Weeks v. United States,

232 U. S. 383 (1914).  As late as 1949, nearly two-thirds of the States did not have an exclusionary rule.  See Wolf v. Colorado,

338 U. S. 25, 29 (1949).  Those States, as then-Judge Cardozo famously explained, did not understand the logic of a rule that allowed “[t]he criminal . . . to go free because the constable has blundered.”  People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13, 21, 150 N. E. 585, 587 (1926).

															The Founders would not have understood the logic of the exclusionary rule either.  Historically, if evidence was relevant and reliable, its admissibility did not “depend upon the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the mode, by which it [was] obtained.”  United States v. The La Jeune Eugenie, 26 F. Cas. 832, 843 (No. 15, 551) (CC Mass. 1822) (Story, J.); accord, 1 S. Greenleaf, Evidence §254a, pp. 825–826 (14th ed. 1883) (“[T]hat . . . subjects of evidence may have been . . . unlawfully obtained . . . is no valid objection to their admissibility if they are pertinent to the issue”); 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence §2183, p. 626 (2d ed. 1923) (“[I]t has long been established that the admissibility of evidence is not affected by the illegality of the means through which the party has been enabled to obtain the evidence” (emphasis deleted)).  And the common law sometimes reflected the inverse of the exclusionary rule: The fact that someone turned out to be guilty could justify an illegal seizure.  See Gelston v. Hoyt, 3 Wheat. 246, 310 (1818) (Story, J.) (“At common law, any person may at his peril, seize for a forfeiture to the government; and if the government adopt his seizure, and the property is condemned, he will be completely justified”); 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown 77 (1721) (“And where a Man arrests another, who is actually guilty of the Crime for which he is arrested, . . . he needs not in justifying it, set forth any special Cause of his Suspicion”).

															Despite this history, the Court concluded in Mapp v. Ohio,

367 U. S. 643 (1961), that the States must apply the federal exclusionary rule in their own courts.  Id., at 655.[2]  Mapp suggested that the exclusionary rule was required by the Constitution itself.  See, e.g., id., at 657 (“[T]he exclusionary rule is an essential part of both the Fourth and
 
Fourteenth Amendments”); id., at 655 (“[E]vidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court”); id., at 655–656 (“[I]t was . . . constitutionally necessary that the exclusion doctrine—an essential part of the right to privacy—be also insisted upon”).[3]  But that suggestion could not withstand even the slightest scrutiny.  The exclusionary rule appears nowhere in the Constitution, postdates the founding by more than a century, and contradicts several longstanding principles of the common law.  See supra, at 2–3; Cuddihy 759–760; Amar,
 
Fourth Amendment First Principles, 107 Harv. L. Rev. 757, 786 (1994); Kaplan, The Limits of the Exclusionary Rule, 26 Stan. L. Rev. 1027, 1030–1031 (1974).

															Recognizing this, the Court has since rejected Mapp’s “ ‘[e]xpansive dicta’ ” and clarified that the exclusionary rule is not required by the Constitution.  Davis v. United States,

564 U. S. 229, 237 (2011) (quoting Hudson v. Michigan,

547 U. S. 586, 591 (2006)).  Suppression, this Court has explained, is not “a personal constitutional right.”  United States v. Calandra,

414 U. S. 338, 348 (1974); accord, Stone v. Powell,

428 U. S. 465, 486 (1976).  The
 
Fourth Amendment “says nothing about suppressing evidence,” Davis, supra, at 236, and a prosecutor’s “use of fruits of a past unlawful search or seizure ‘work[s] no new
 
Fourth Amendment wrong,’ ” United States v. Leon,

468 U. S. 897, 906 (1984) (quoting Calandra, supra, at 354).[4]  Instead, the exclusionary rule is a “judicially created” doctrine that is “prudential rather than constitutionally mandated.”  Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole v. Scott,

524 U. S. 357, 363 (1998); accord, Herring v. United States,

555 U. S. 135, 139 (2009); Arizona v. Evans,

514 U. S. 1, 10 (1995); United States v. Janis,

428 U. S. 433, 459–460 (1976).[5]

															Although the exclusionary rule is not part of the Constitution, this Court has continued to describe it as “federal law” and assume that it applies to the States.  Evans, supra; Massachusetts v. Sheppard,

468 U. S. 981, 991 (1984).  Yet the Court has never attempted to justify this assumption.  If the exclusionary rule is federal law, but is not grounded in the Constitution or a federal statute, then it must be federal common law.  See Monaghan, Foreword: Constitutional Common Law, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 10 (1975).  As federal common law, however, the exclusionary rule cannot bind the States.

															Federal law trumps state law only by virtue of the Supremacy Clause, which makes the “Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties . . . the supreme Law of the Land,” Art. VI, cl. 2.  When the Supremacy Clause refers to “[t]he Laws of the United States made in Pursuance [of the Constitution],” it means federal statutes, not federal common law.  Ramsey, The Supremacy Clause, Original Meaning, and Modern Law, 74 Ohio St. L. J. 559, 572–599 (2013) (Ramsey); Clark, Separation of Powers as a Safeguard of Federalism, 79 Texas L. Rev. 1321, 1334–1336, 1338–1367 (2001) (Clark); see also Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 211 (1824) (Marshall, C. J.) (“The appropriate application of that part of the clause which confers . . . supremacy on laws . . . is to . . . the laws of Congress, made in pursuance of the constitution”); Hart, The Relations Between State and Federal Law, 54 Colum. L. Rev. 489, 500 (1954) (“[T]he supremacy clause is limited to those ‘Laws’ of the United States which are passed by Congress pursuant to the Constitution”).  By referencing laws “made in Pursuance” of the Constitution, the Supremacy Clause incorporates the requirements of Article I, which force Congress to stay within its enumerated powers, §8, and follow the cumbersome procedures for enacting federal legislation, §7.  See Wyeth v. Levine,

555 U. S. 555, 585–587 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States §1831, pp. 693–694 (1833); Clark 1334.  Those procedures—especially the requirement that bills pass the Senate, where the States are represented equally and Senators were originally elected by state legislatures—safeguard federalism by making federal legislation more difficult to pass and more responsive to state interests.  See Ramsey 565; Clark 1342–1343.  Federal common law bypasses these procedures and would not have been considered the kind of “la[w]” that can bind the States under the Supremacy Clause.  See Ramsey 564–565, 568, 574, 581; Jay, Origins of Federal Common Law: Part Two, 133 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1231, 1275 (1985).

															True, this Court, without citing the Supremacy Clause, has recognized several “enclaves of federal judge-made law which bind the States.”  Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino,

376 U. S. 398, 426 (1964); see, e.g., id., at 427–428 (foreign affairs); Hinderlider v. La Plata River & Cherry Creek Ditch Co.,

304 U. S. 92, 110 (1938) (disputes between States); Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co.,

317 U. S. 239, 245 (1942) (admiralty); Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States,

318 U. S. 363, 366 (1943) (certain rights and obligations of the United States); Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.,

353 U. S. 448, 456–457 (1957) (aspects of federal labor law).  To the extent these enclaves are delegations of lawmaking authority from the Constitution or a federal statute, they do not conflict with the original meaning of the Supremacy Clause (though they might be illegitimate for other reasons).  See Ramsey 568–569; Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L. Rev. 100, 131–132 (1985).  To the extent these enclaves are not rooted in the Constitution or a statute, their pre-emptive force is questionable.  But that is why this Court has “limited” them to a “ ‘few’ ” “narrow areas” where “the authority and duties of the United States as sovereign are intimately involved” or where “the interstate or international nature of the controversy makes it inappropriate for state law to control.”  Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc.,

451 U. S. 630, 640–641 (1981) (quoting Wheeldin v. Wheeler,

373 U. S. 647, 651 (1963)).  Outside these narrow enclaves, the general rule is that “[t]here is no federal general common law” and “[e]xcept in matters governed by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of the State.”  Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,

304 U. S. 64, 78 (1938).

															These precedents do not support requiring the States to apply the exclusionary rule.  As explained, the exclusionary rule is not rooted in the Constitution or a federal statute.  This Court has repeatedly rejected the idea that the rule is in the Fourth and
 
Fourteenth Amendments, expressly or implicitly.  See Davis, 564 U. S., at 236; Leon, 468 U. S., at 905–906; cf. Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 11) (explaining that reading implied remedies into the Constitution is “a ‘disfavored’ judicial activity”).  And the exclusionary rule does not implicate any of the special enclaves of federal common law.  It does not govern the sovereign duties of the United States or disputes of an interstate or international character.  Instead, the rule governs the methods that state police officers use to solve crime and the procedures that state courts use at criminal trials—subjects that the Federal Government generally has no power to regulate.  See United States v. Morrison,

529 U. S. 598, 618 (2000) (explaining that “[t]he regulation” and “vindication” of intrastate crime “has always been the province of the States”); Smith v. Phillips,

455 U. S. 209, 221 (1982) (“Federal courts hold no supervisory authority over state judicial proceedings”).  These are not areas where federal common law can bind the States.[6]

															*  *  *

															In sum, I am skeptical of this Court’s authority to impose the exclusionary rule on the States.  We have not yet revisited that question in light of our modern precedents, which reject Mapp’s essential premise that the exclusionary rule is required by the Constitution.  We should do so.
Notes
1
 Collins did not live at the house; he merely stayed there with his girlfriend several times a week.  But Virginia does not contest Collins’ assertion that the house is his, so I agree with the Court that Virginia has forfeited any argument to the contrary.  See ante, at 2, n. 1; United States v. Jones,

565 U. S. 400, 404, n. 2 (2012). 

2
 Twelve years before Mapp, the Court declined to apply the federal exclusionary rule to the States.  See Wolf v. Colorado,

338 U. S. 25 (1949).  Wolf denied that the Constitution requires the exclusionary rule, since “most of the English-speaking world” does not apply that rule and alternatives such as civil suits and internal police discipline do not “fal[l] below the minimal standards assured by the Due Process Clause.”  Id., at 29, 31.  In Mapp, the Court overruled Wolf and applied the exclusionary rule to the States, even though no party had briefed or argued that question.  See 367 U. S., at 672–674, and nn. 4–6 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Stewart, The Road to Mapp v. Ohio and Beyond: The Origins, Development and Future of the Exclusionary Rule, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1365, 1368 (1983). 

3
 Justice Black, the essential fifth vote in Mapp, did not agree that the
 
Fourth Amendment contains an exclusionary rule.  See 367 U. S., at 661–662 (concurring opinion) (“[T]he
 
Fourth Amendment does not itself contain any provision expressly precluding the use of such evidence, and I am extremely doubtful that such a provision could prop-erly be inferred”).  But he concluded that, when the police seize private papers, suppression is required by a combination of the Fourth and
 
Fifth Amendments.  See id., at 662–666. 

4
 The exclusionary rule is not required by the Due Process Clause either.  Given its nonexistent historical foundation, the exclusionary rule cannot be a “settled usag[e] and mod[e] of proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England, before the emigration of our ancestors.”  Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 277 (1856).  And the rule “has ‘no bearing on . . . the fairness of the trial.’ ”  Desist v. United States,

394 U. S. 244, 254, n. 24 (1969).  If anything, the exclusionary rule itself “ ‘offends basic concepts of the criminal justice system’ ” and exacts a “ ‘costly toll upon truth-seeking.’ ”  Herring v. United States,

555 U. S. 135, 141 (2009).  “The [excluded] evidence is likely to be the most reliable that could possibly be obtained [and thus] exclusion rather than admission creates the danger of a verdict erroneous on the true facts.”  H. Friendly, Benchmarks 260 (1967). 

5
 These statements cannot be dismissed as mere dicta.  Cf. Dickerson v. United States,

530 U. S. 428, 438–441, and n. 2 (2000) (constitutionalizing the rule announced in Miranda v. Arizona,

384 U. S. 436 (1966), despite earlier precedents to the contrary).  The nonconstitutional status of the exclusionary rule is why this Court held in Stone v. Powell,

428 U. S. 465, 482–495 (1976), that violations are not cognizable on federal habeas review.  Cf. Dickerson, supra, at 439 n. 3.  And the nonconstitutional status of the rule is why this Court has created more than a dozen exceptions to it, which apply even when the
 
Fourth Amendment is concededly violated.  See United States v. Weaver, 808 F. 3d 26, 49 (CADC 2015) (Henderson, J., dissenting) (collecting cases); cf. Dickerson, supra, at 441. 

6
 Of course, the States are free to adopt their own exclusionary rules as a matter of state law.  But nothing in the Federal Constitution requires them to do so.  Even assuming the Constitution requires particular state-law remedies for federal constitutional violations, it does not require the exclusionary rule.  The “sole purpose” of the exclusionary rule is “to deter future
 
Fourth Amendment violations”; it does not “ ‘redress’ ” or “ ‘repair’ ” past ones.  Davis v. United States,

564 U. S. 229, 236–237 (2011).  This Court has noted the lack of evidence supporting its deterrent effect, see United States v. Janis,

428 U. S. 433, 450, n. 22 (1976), and this Court has recognized the effectiveness of alternative deterrents such as state tort law, state criminal law, internal police discipline, and suits under

42 U. S. C. §1983, see Hudson v. Michigan,

547 U. S. 586, 597–599 (2006).
