															UNITED STATES, et al., PETITIONERS
v. TEXAS, et al.

															on writ of certiorari before judgment to the
united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit

															[June 23, 2023]

															

															Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the
Court.

															In 2021, after President Biden took office, the
Department of Homeland Security issued new Guidelines for
immigration enforcement. The Guidelines prioritize the arrest and
removal from the United States of noncitizens who are suspected
terrorists or dangerous criminals, or who have unlawfully entered
the country only recently, for example. Texas and Louisiana sued
the Department of Homeland Security. According to those States, the
Department’s new Guidelines violate federal statutes that
purportedly require the Department to arrest more criminal
noncitizens pending their removal.

															The States essentially want the Federal
Judiciary to order the Executive Branch to alter its arrest policy
so as to make more arrests. But this Court has long held
“that a citizen lacks standing to contest the policies of the
prosecuting authority when he himself is neither prosecuted nor
threatened with prosecution.” Linda R. S.
v. Richard D., 410
U.S. 614, 619 (1973). Consistent with that fundamental Article
III principle, we conclude that the States lack Article III
standing to bring this suit.

															I

															In 2021, Secretary of Homeland Security
Mayorkas promulgated new “Guidelines for the Enforcement of
Civil Immigration Law.” The Guidelines prioritize the arrest
and removal from the United States of noncitizens who are suspected
terrorists or dangerous criminals, or who have unlawfully entered
the country only recently, for example.

															Texas and Louisiana sued the Department of
Homeland Security, as well as other federal officials and agencies.
According to those States, the Guidelines contravene two federal
statutes that purportedly require the Department to arrest more
criminal noncitizens pending their removal. First, the States
contend that for certain noncitizens, such as those who are
removable due to a state criminal conviction, §1226(c) of
Title 8 says that the Department “shall” arrest those
noncitizens and take them into custody when they are released from
state prison. Second, §1231(a)(2), as the States see it,
provides that the Department “shall” arrest and detain
certain noncitizens for 90 days after entry of a final order of
removal.

															In the States’ view, the
Department’s failure to comply with those statutory mandates
imposes costs on the States. The States assert, for example, that
they must continue to incarcerate or supply social services such as
healthcare and education to noncitizens who should be (but are not
being) arrested by the Federal Government.

															The U. S. District Court for the Southern
District of Texas found that the States would incur costs as a
result of the Department’s Guidelines. Based on those costs,
the District Court determined that the States have standing. On the
merits, the District Court ruled that the Guidelines are unlawful,
and vacated the Guidelines. 606 F. Supp. 3d 437, 502 (SD Tex.
2022); see 5 U. S. C. §706(2). The U. S. Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit declined to stay the District
Court’s judgment. 40 F. 4th 205 (2022). This Court granted
certiorari before judgment. 597 U. S. ___ (2022).

															II

															Article III of the Constitution confines the
federal judicial power to “Cases” and
“Controversies.” Under Article III, a case or
controversy can exist only if a plaintiff has standing to
sue—a bedrock constitutional requirement that this Court has
applied to all manner of important disputes. See, e.g.,
TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U. S. ___, ___
(2021) (slip op., at 7); California v. Texas, 593
U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 4); Carney v.
Adams, 592 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2020) (slip op.,
at 4–5); Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S.
693, 704 (2013); Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l
USA, 568 U.S.
398, 408 (2013); Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S.
811, 818 (1997); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,
504 U.S.
555, 559–560 (1992); Allen v. Wright,
468 U.S.
737, 750 (1984); Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to
Stop the War, 418 U.S.
208, 215 (1974); United States v. Richardson,
418 U.S.
166, 171 (1974).

															As this Court’s precedents amply
demonstrate, Article III standing is “not merely a
troublesome hurdle to be overcome if possible so as to reach the
‘merits’ of a lawsuit which a party desires to have
adjudicated; it is a part of the basic charter promulgated by the
Framers of the Constitution at Philadelphia in 1787.”
Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454
U.S. 464, 476 (1982). The principle of Article III standing is
“built on a single basic idea—the idea of separation of
powers.” Allen, 468 U. S., at 752. Standing
doctrine helps safeguard the Judiciary’s proper—and
properly limited—role in our constitutional system. By
ensuring that a plaintiff has standing to sue, federal courts
“prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the
powers of the political branches.” Clapper, 568
U. S., at 408.

															A

															According to Texas and Louisiana, the arrest
policy spelled out in the Department of Homeland Security’s
2021 Guidelines does not comply with the statutory arrest mandates
in §1226(c) and §1231(a)(2). The States want the Federal
Judiciary to order the Department to alter its arrest policy so
that the Department arrests more noncitizens.[1]

															The threshold question is whether the States
have standing under Article III to maintain this suit. The answer
is no.

															To establish standing, a plaintiff must show an
injury in fact caused by the defendant and redressable by a court
order. See Lujan, 504 U. S., at 560–561. The
District Court found that the States would incur additional costs
because the Federal Government is not arresting more noncitizens.
Monetary costs are of course an injury. But this Court has
“also stressed that the alleged injury must be legally and
judicially cognizable.” Raines, 521 U. S., at
819. That “requires, among other things,” that the
“dispute is traditionally thought to be capable of resolution
through the judicial process”—in other words, that the
asserted injury is traditionally redressable in federal court.
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Valley
Forge, 454 U. S., at 472. In adhering to that core
principle, the Court has examined “history and
tradition,” among other things, as “a meaningful guide
to the types of cases that Article III empowers federal courts to
consider.” Sprint Communications Co. v. APCC
Services, Inc., 554 U.S.
269, 274 (2008); see TransUnion LLC, 594 U. S., at
___–___ (slip op., at 8–9).

															The States have not cited any precedent,
history, or tradition of courts ordering the Executive Branch to
change its arrest or prosecution policies so that the Executive
Branch makes more arrests or initiates more prosecutions. On the
contrary, this Court has previously ruled that a plaintiff lacks
standing to bring such a suit.

															The leading precedent is Linda R. S. v.
Richard D., 410 U.S.
614 (1973). The plaintiff in that case contested a
State’s policy of declining to prosecute certain
child-support violations. This Court decided that the plaintiff
lacked standing to challenge the State’s policy, reasoning
that in “American jurisprudence at least,” a party
“lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution
. . . of another.” Id., at 619. The
Court concluded that “a citizen lacks standing to contest the
policies of the prosecuting authority when he himself is neither
prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution.” Ibid.

															The Court’s Article III holding in
Linda R. S. applies to challenges to the Executive
Branch’s exercise of enforcement discretion over whether to
arrest or prosecute. See id., at 617, 619; Castle
Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S.
748, 760–761, 767, n. 13 (2005); cf. Sure-Tan,
Inc. v. NLRB, 467 U.S.
883, 897 (1984) (citing Linda R. S. principle in
immigration context and stating that the petitioners there had
“no judicially cognizable interest in procuring enforcement
of the immigration laws” by the Executive Branch). And
importantly, that Article III standing principle remains the law
today; the States have pointed to no case or historical practice
holding otherwise. A “telling indication of the severe
constitutional problem” with the States’ assertion of
standing to bring this lawsuit “is the lack of historical
precedent” supporting it. Free Enterprise Fund v.
Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S.
477, 505 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also
Raines, 521 U. S., at 826 (“Not only do appellees
lack support from precedent, but historical practice appears to cut
against them as well”).

															In short, this Court’s precedents and
longstanding historical practice establish that the States’
suit here is not the kind redressable by a federal court.

															B

															Several good reasons explain why, as Linda
R. S. held, federal courts have not traditionally
entertained lawsuits of this kind.

															To begin with, when the Executive Branch elects
not to arrest or prosecute, it does not exercise coercive
power over an individual’s liberty or property, and thus does
not infringe upon interests that courts often are called upon to
protect. See Lujan, 504 U. S., at 561–562. And
for standing purposes, the absence of coercive power over the
plaintiff makes a difference: When “a plaintiff ’s
asserted injury arises from the government’s allegedly
unlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of someone else, much
more is needed” to establish standing. Id., at 562
(emphasis deleted).[2]

															Moreover, lawsuits alleging that the Executive
Branch has made an insufficient number of arrests or brought an
insufficient number of prosecutions run up against the
Executive’s Article II authority to enforce federal law.
Article II of the Constitution assigns the “executive
Power” to the President and provides that the President
“shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”
U. S. Const., Art. II, §1, cl. 1; §3.
Under Article II, the Executive Branch possesses authority to
decide “how to prioritize and how aggressively to pursue
legal actions against defendants who violate the law.”
TransUnion LLC, 594 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13);
see Lujan, 504 U. S., at 576–578; Allen,
468 U. S., at 760–761. The Executive Branch—not
the Judiciary—makes arrests and prosecutes offenses on behalf
of the United States. See United States v. Nixon,
418 U.S.
683, 693 (1974) (“the Executive Branch has exclusive
authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a
case”); Printz v. United States, 521 U.S.
898, 922–923 (1997) (Brady Act provisions held
unconstitutional because, among other things, they transferred
power to execute federal law to state officials); United
States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S.
456, 464 (1996) (decisions about enforcement of “the
Nation’s criminal laws” lie within the “special
province of the Executive” (internal quotation marks
omitted)); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S.
1, 138 (1976) (“A lawsuit is the ultimate remedy for a
breach of the law, and it is to the President, and not to the
Congress, that the Constitution entrusts the responsibility to
‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully
executed’ ” (quoting U. S. Const.,
Art. II, §3)); see also United States v.
Cox, 342 F.2d 167, 171 (CA5 1965).

															That principle of enforcement discretion over
arrests and prosecutions extends to the immigration context, where
the Court has stressed that the Executive’s enforcement
discretion implicates not only “normal domestic law
enforcement priorities” but also “foreign-policy
objectives.” Reno v. American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S.
471, 490–491 (1999). In line with those principles, this
Court has declared that the Executive Branch also retains
discretion over whether to remove a noncitizen from the United
States. Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S.
387, 396 (2012) (“Federal officials, as an initial
matter, must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at
all”).

															In addition to the Article II problems raised by
judicial review of the Executive Branch’s arrest and
prosecution policies, courts generally lack meaningful standards
for assessing the propriety of enforcement choices in this area.
After all, the Executive Branch must prioritize its enforcement
efforts. See Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S.
598, 607–608 (1985). That is because the Executive Branch
(i) invariably lacks the resources to arrest and prosecute every
violator of every law and (ii) must constantly react and adjust to
the ever-shifting public-safety and public-welfare needs of the
American people.

															This case illustrates the point. As the District
Court found, the Executive Branch does not possess the resources
necessary to arrest or remove all of the noncitizens covered by
§1226(c) and §1231(a)(2). That reality is not an
anomaly—it is a constant. For the last 27 years since
§1226(c) and §1231(a)(2) were enacted in their current
form, all five Presidential administrations have determined that
resource constraints necessitated prioritization in making
immigration arrests.

															In light of inevitable resource constraints and
regularly changing public-safety and public-welfare needs, the
Executive Branch must balance many factors when devising arrest and
prosecution policies. That complicated balancing process in turn
leaves courts without meaningful standards for assessing those
policies. Cf. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S.
821, 830–832 (1985); Lincoln v. Vigil,
508 U.S.
182, 190–192 (1993). Therefore, in both Article III cases
and Administrative Procedure Act cases, this Court has consistently
recognized that federal courts are generally not the proper forum
for resolving claims that the Executive Branch should make more
arrests or bring more prosecutions. See Linda R. S.,
410 U. S., at 619; cf. Heckler, 470 U. S., at 831
(recognizing the “general unsuitability for judicial review
of agency decisions to refuse enforcement”); ICC v.
Locomotive Engineers, 482 U.S.
270, 283 (1987) (“it is entirely clear that the refusal
to prosecute cannot be the subject of judicial
review”).[3]

															All of those considerations help explain why
federal courts have not traditionally entertained lawsuits of this
kind. By concluding that Texas and Louisiana lack standing here, we
abide by and reinforce the proper role of the Federal Judiciary
under Article III. The States’ novel standing argument, if
accepted, would entail expansive judicial direction of the
Department’s arrest policies. If the Court green-lighted this
suit, we could anticipate complaints in future years about alleged
Executive Branch under-enforcement of any similarly worded
laws—whether they be drug laws, gun laws, obstruction of
justice laws, or the like. We decline to start the Federal
Judiciary down that uncharted path. Our constitutional system of
separation of powers “contemplates a more restricted role for
Article III courts.” Raines, 521 U. S., at
828.

															C

															In holding that Texas and Louisiana lack
standing, we do not suggest that federal courts may never entertain
cases involving the Executive Branch’s alleged failure to
make more arrests or bring more prosecutions.

															First, the Court has adjudicated
selective-prosecution claims under the Equal Protection Clause. In
those cases, however, a party typically seeks to prevent his or her
own prosecution, not to mandate additional prosecutions against
other possible defendants. See, e.g., Wayte, 470
U. S., at 604; Armstrong, 517 U. S., at 459,
463.

															Second, as the Solicitor General points
out, the standing analysis might differ when Congress elevates
de facto injuries to the status of legally cognizable
injuries redressable by a federal court. See Brief for Petitioners
20, n. 3; cf. TransUnion LLC, 594 U. S., at
___–___ (slip op., at 10–11); Federal Election
Comm’n v. Akins, 524 U.S.
11, 20 (1998); Raines, 521 U. S., at 820,
n. 3; Lujan, 504 U. S., at 578; Linda
R. S., 410 U. S., at 617, n. 3. For
example, Congress might (i) specifically authorize suits against
the Executive Branch by a defined set of plaintiffs who have
suffered concrete harms from executive under-enforcement and (ii)
specifically authorize the Judiciary to enter appropriate orders
requiring additional arrests or prosecutions by the Executive
Branch.

															Here, however, the relevant statutes do not
supply such specific authorization. The statutes, even under the
States’ own reading, simply say that the Department
“shall” arrest certain noncitizens. Given the
“deep-rooted nature of law-enforcement discretion,” a
purported statutory arrest mandate, without more, does not entitle
any particular plaintiff to enforce that mandate in federal court.
Castle Rock, 545 U. S., at 761, 764–765, 767, n.
13; cf. Heckler, 470 U. S., at 835. For an arrest
mandate to be enforceable in federal court, we would need at least
a “stronger indication” from Congress that judicial
review of enforcement discretion is appropriate—for example,
specific authorization for particular plaintiffs to sue and for
federal courts to order more arrests or prosecutions by the
Executive. Castle Rock, 545 U. S., at 761. We do not
take a position on whether such a statute would suffice for Article
III purposes; our only point is that no such statute is present in
this case.[4]

															Third, the standing calculus might change
if the Executive Branch wholly abandoned its statutory
responsibilities to make arrests or bring prosecutions. Under the
Administrative Procedure Act, a plaintiff arguably could obtain
review of agency non-enforcement if an agency “has
consciously and expressly adopted a general policy that is so
extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutory
responsibilities.” Heckler, 470 U. S., at 833,
n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at
839 (Brennan, J., concurring); cf. 5 U. S. C.
§706(1). So too, an extreme case of non-enforcement arguably
could exceed the bounds of enforcement discretion and support
Article III standing. But the States have not advanced a
Heckler-style “abdication” argument in this case
or argued that the Executive has entirely ceased enforcing the
relevant statutes. Therefore, we do not analyze the standing
ramifications of such a hypothetical scenario.

															Fourth, a challenge to an Executive
Branch policy that involves both the Executive Branch’s
arrest or prosecution priorities and the Executive
Branch’s provision of legal benefits or legal status could
lead to a different standing analysis. That is because the
challenged policy might implicate more than simply the
Executive’s traditional enforcement discretion. Cf.
Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of
Cal., 591 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2020) (slip op., at
11–12) (benefits such as work authorization and Medicare
eligibility accompanied by non-enforcement meant that the policy
was “more than simply a non-enforcement policy”);
Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 154 (CA5 2015)
(Linda R. S. “concerned only
nonprosecution,” which is distinct from “both
nonprosecution and the conferral of benefits”),
aff ’d by an equally divided Court, 579 U.S. 547 (2016).
Again, we need not resolve the Article III consequences of such a
policy.

															Fifth, policies governing the continued
detention of noncitizens who have already been arrested arguably
might raise a different standing question than arrest or
prosecution policies. Cf. Biden v. Texas, 597
U. S. ___ (2022). But this case does not concern a detention
policy, so we do not address the issue here.[5]

															D

															The discrete standing question raised by this
case rarely arises because federal statutes that purport to
require the Executive Branch to make arrests or bring
prosecutions are rare—not surprisingly, given the
Executive’s Article II authority to enforce federal law and
the deeply rooted history of enforcement discretion in American
law. Indeed, the States cite no similarly worded federal laws. This
case therefore involves both a highly unusual provision of federal
law and a highly unusual lawsuit.

															To be clear, our Article III decision today
should in no way be read to suggest or imply that the Executive
possesses some freestanding or general constitutional authority to
disregard statutes requiring or prohibiting executive action.
Moreover, the Federal Judiciary of course routinely and
appropriately decides justiciable cases involving statutory
requirements or prohibitions on the Executive. See, e.g.,
American Hospital Assn. v. Becerra, 596 U. S.
___, ___–___ (2022) (slip op., at 9–14);
Weyerhaeuser Co. v. United States Fish and Wildlife
Serv., 586 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (slip op., at
8–15); Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S.
189, 196–201 (2012); Hamdan v. Rumsfeld,
548 U.S.
557, 592–595, 613–615, 635 (2006); id., at
636–646 (Kennedy, J., concurring); Youngstown Sheet &
Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S.
579, 637–638, 640 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).

															This case is categorically different, however,
because it implicates only one discrete aspect of the executive
power—namely, the Executive Branch’s traditional
discretion over whether to take enforcement actions against
violators of federal law. And this case raises only the narrow
Article III standing question of whether the Federal Judiciary may
in effect order the Executive Branch to take enforcement actions
against violators of federal law—here, by making more
arrests. Under this Court’s Article III precedents and the
historical practice, the answer is no.[6]

															It bears emphasis that the question of whether
the federal courts have jurisdiction under Article III is distinct
from the question of whether the Executive Branch is complying with
the relevant statutes—here, §1226(c) and
§1231(a)(2). In other words, the question of reviewability is
different from the question of legality. We take no position on
whether the Executive Branch here is complying with its legal
obligations under §1226(c) and §1231(a)(2). We hold only
that the federal courts are not the proper forum to resolve this
dispute.

															On that point, even though the federal courts
lack Article III jurisdiction over this suit, other forums remain
open for examining the Executive Branch’s arrest policies.
For example, Congress possesses an array of tools to analyze and
influence those policies—oversight, appropriations, the
legislative process, and Senate confirmations, to name a few. Cf.
Raines, 521 U. S., at 829; Lincoln, 508
U. S., at 193. And through elections, American voters can both
influence Executive Branch policies and hold elected officials to
account for enforcement decisions. In any event, those are
political checks for the political process. We do not opine on
whether any such actions are appropriate in this instance.

															The Court’s standing decision today is
narrow and simply maintains the longstanding jurisprudential status
quo. See Linda R. S., 410 U. S., at 619. The
Court’s decision does not alter the balance of powers between
Congress and the Executive, or change the Federal Judiciary’s
traditional role in separation of powers cases.

															*  *  *

															In sum, the States have brought an
extraordinarily unusual lawsuit. They want a federal court to order
the Executive Branch to alter its arrest policies so as to make
more arrests. Federal courts have not traditionally entertained
that kind of lawsuit; indeed, the States cite no precedent for a
lawsuit like this. The States lack Article III standing because
this Court’s precedents and the “historical
experience” preclude the States’ “attempt to
litigate this dispute at this time and in this form.”
Raines, 521 U. S., at 829. And because the States lack
Article III standing, the District Court did not have jurisdiction.
We reverse the judgment of the District Court.

															

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1
 The States may want the
Department to arrest all of the noncitizens it is now
arresting plus other noncitizens—or instead to arrest
some of the noncitizens it is now arresting plus other
noncitizens. Either way, the States seek a court order that would
alter the Department’s arrest policy so that the Department
arrests more noncitizens.
2
 By contrast, when
“the plaintiff is himself an object of the action (or forgone
action) at issue,” “there is ordinarily little question
that the action or inaction has caused him injury, and that a
judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.”
Lujan, 504 U. S., at 561–562.
3
 Also, the plaintiffs here
are States, and federal courts must remain mindful of bedrock
Article III constraints in cases brought by States against an
executive agency or officer. To be sure, States sometimes have
standing to sue the United States or an executive agency or
officer. See, e.g., New York v. United States,
505 U.S.
144 (1992). But in our system of dual federal and state
sovereignty, federal policies frequently generate indirect effects
on state revenues or state spending. And when a State asserts, for
example, that a federal law has produced only those kinds of
indirect effects, the State’s claim for standing can become
more attenuated. See Massachusetts v. Laird,
400 U.S.
886 (1970); Florida v. Mellon, 273 U.S.
12, 16–18 (1927); cf. Lujan, 504 U. S., at
561–562. In short, none of the various theories of standing
asserted by the States in this case overcomes the fundamental
Article III problem with this lawsuit.
4
 As the Solicitor General
noted, those kinds of statutes, by infringing on the
Executive’s enforcement discretion, could also raise Article
II issues. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 24–25.
5
 This case concerns only
arrest and prosecution policies, and we therefore address only that
issue. As to detention, the Solicitor General has represented that
the Department’s Guidelines do not affect continued detention
of noncitizens already in federal custody. See Brief for
Petitioners 24; Tr. of Oral Arg. 40 (Solicitor General: “the
Guidelines govern only decisions about apprehension and removal,
whether to charge a non-citizen in the first place. . . .
the Guidelines don’t have anything to do with continued
detention”); Guidelines Memorandum, App. 111 (“This
memorandum provides guidance for the apprehension and removal of
noncitizens”); id., at 113 (“We will prioritize
for apprehension and removal noncitizens who are a threat to our
national security, public safety, and border
security”).
6
 As part of their argument
for standing, the States also point to Massachusetts v.
EPA, 549 U.S.
497 (2007). Putting aside any disagreements that some may have
with Massachusetts v. EPA, that decision does not
control this case. The issue there involved a challenge to the
denial of a statutorily authorized petition for rulemaking, not a
challenge to an exercise of the Executive’s enforcement
discretion. Id., at 520, 526; see also id., at 527
(noting that there are “key differences between a denial of a
petition for rulemaking and an agency’s decision not to
initiate an enforcement action” and that “an
agency’s refusal to initiate enforcement proceedings is not
ordinarily subject to judicial review”).
