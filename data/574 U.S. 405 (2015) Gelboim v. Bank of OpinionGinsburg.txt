															ELLEN GELBOIM, etÂ al., PETITIONERS v. BANK OF
AMERICA CORPORATION etÂ al.

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the second circuit

															[January 21, 2015]

															Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.

															An unsuccessful litigant in a federal district court may take an
appeal, as a matter of right, from a â€œfinal
decisio[n] of the district cour[t].â€28
U.Â S.Â C. Â§1291. The question
here presented: Is the right to appeal secured by Â§1291
affected when a case is consolidated for pretrial proceedings in
multidistrict litigation (or MDL) authorized by28
U.Â S.Â C. Â§1407?

															Petitioners Ellen Gelboim and Linda Zacher filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York a
class-action complaint raising a single claim. They alleged that a
number of banks, acting in concert, had violated federal antitrust
law. Their case was consolidated for pretrial proceedings together
with some 60 other cases, commenced in different districts, raising
â€œone or more common questions of
fact,â€ Â§1407(a).

															The defendant banks, respondents here, moved to dismiss the
Gelboim-Zacher complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs had
suffered no antitrust injury. The District Court granted the
motion, denied leave to amend the complaint, and dismissed the case
in its entirety. Other cases made part of the multidistrict
pretrial proceedings, however, presented discrete claims and
remained before the District Court.

															The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, acting on its own
motion, dismissed the appeal filed by Gelboim and Zacher for want
of appellate jurisdiction. We reverse the Second
Circuitâ€™s judgment and hold that the
Gelboim-Zacher complaint retained its independent status for
purposes of appellate jurisdiction under Â§1291.
Petitionersâ€™ right to appeal ripened when the
District Court dismissed their case, not upon eventual completion
of multidistrict proceedings in all of the consolidated cases.

															I

															Three legal prescriptions figure in this case: Title 28
U.Â S.Â C. Â§Â§1291 and
1407, and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).

															Section 1291 gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over
appeals from â€œall final decisions of the
district courts of the United States.â€ A
â€œfinal decisionâ€ is one
â€œby which a district court disassociates itself
from a case.â€ Swint v. Chambers County
Commâ€™n,514 U.Â S. 35,42 (1995).
While decisions of this Court have accorded Â§1291 a
â€œpractical rather than a technical
construction,â€ Mohawk Industries, Inc. v.
Carpenter,558 U.Â S. 100,106 (2009) (quoting
Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.,337
U.Â S. 541,546 (1949)), the statuteâ€™s
core application is to rulings that terminate an action, see
Catlin v. United States,324 U.Â S. 229,233
(1945) (final decision is â€œone which ends the
litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but
execute the judgmentâ€).

															Rule 54(b) permits district courts to authorize immediate appeal
of dispositive rulings on separate claims in a civil action raising
multiple claims:

															â€œWhen an action presents more than one claim
for relief .Â .Â . or when multiple parties
are involved, the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to
one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the
court expressly determines that there is no just reason for
delay.â€[1]

															Rule 54(b) relaxes â€œthe former general
practice that, in multiple claims actions, all the claims
had to be finally decided before an appeal could be entertained
from a final decision upon any of them.â€ Sears,
Roebuck & Co. v. Mackey,351 U.Â S.
427,434 (1956). The Federal Rules allow a plaintiff to
â€œstate [in one complaint] as many separate
claims .Â .Â . as it has.â€ Rule
8(d)(3). Rule 54(b) was adopted in view of the breadth of the
â€œcivil actionâ€ the Rules allow,
specifically â€œto avoid the possible
injusticeâ€ of â€œdelay[ing] judgment
o[n] a distinctly separate claim [pending] adjudication of the
entire case.â€ Report of Advisory Committee on Proposed
Amendments to Rules of Civil Procedure 70 (1946) (explaining that
Rule 54(b) was recast in 1946 to avoid confusion and
misapplication); see Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion
Corp.,338 U.Â S. 507,511 (1950) (Rule 54(b)
responded to liberalized joinder of claims and parties under the
Federal Rules, which â€œincreased the danger of
hardship and denial of justice through delay if each issue must
await the determination of all issues as to all parties before a
final judgment can be hadâ€). The Rule thus aimed to
augment, not diminish, appeal opportunity.

															Section 1407 is of more recent vintage. Enacted in 1968 in
response to a growing number of complex but related cases filed in
multiple districts, Â§1407 authorizes the Judicial Panel
on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to transfer civil actions
â€œinvolving one or more common questions of fact
.Â .Â . to any district for coordinated or
consolidated pretrial proceedingsâ€ in order to
â€œpromote the just and efficient conduct of such
actions.â€ Â§1407(a); see H.Â R.
Rep. No. 1130, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1968) (Â§1407
codified procedures used in the early 1960â€™s to
resolve more than 1,800 separate actions filed against electrical
equipment manufacturers in 33 District Courts, all of the actions
seeking damages for antitrust law violations).

															Transfer under Â§1407 aims to
â€œeliminate duplication in discovery, avoid
conflicting rulings and schedules, reduce litigation cost, and save
the time and effort of the parties, the attorneys, the witnesses,
and the courts.â€ Manual for Complex Litigation
Â§20.131, p. 220 (4th ed. 2004).
â€œEach actionâ€ transferred pursuant
to Â§1407, the provision instructs,
â€œshall be remanded by the panel at or before the
conclusion of .Â .Â . pretrial proceedings to
the district from which it was transferred unless it shall have
been previously terminated.â€ Â§1407(a).

															II

															The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a benchmark
interest rate disseminated by the British
Bankersâ€™ Association based on the rate at which
certain banks predict they can borrow funds. LIBOR is a reference
point in determining interest rates for financial instruments in
the United States and globally.

															In August 2011, the JPML established MDL No. 2262 (LIBOR MDL)
for cases involving allegations that the banks named as defendants
understated their borrowing costs, thereby depressing LIBOR and
enabling the banks to pay lower interest rates on financial
instruments sold to investors. InÂ re Libor-Based
Financial Instruments Antitrust Litigation, 802
F.Â Supp. 2d 1380 (JPML 2011). Composing the LIBOR MDL,
over 60 actions, commenced in California, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin, were coordinated or consolidated
for pretrial proceedings in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York.

															In June 2012, the District Court entertained a motion to dismiss
four categories of cases included in the MDL. The first three
categories involved putative class actions, each with a single lead
case: (1) the Gelboim-Zacher action, filed on behalf of purchasers
of bonds with LIBOR-linked interest rates; (2) an action filed on
behalf of purchasers of over-the-counter LIBOR-based instruments
(OTC plaintiffs); (3) an action filed on behalf of purchasers of
LIBOR-based instruments on exchanges (Exchange plaintiffs). The
fourth category, not relevant here, comprised a set of individual
actions filed by Charles Schwab Corporation and related entities.
The Gelboim-Zacher complaint asserted a federal antitrust claim
under Â§1 of the Sherman Act, 15
U.Â S.Â C. Â§1, and that claim
only, while the complaints in the other actions asserted a federal
antitrust claim in addition to other differently based federal and
state claims.

															Determining that no plaintiff could assert a cognizable
antitrust injury, the District Court granted the
banksâ€™ motion to dismiss
plaintiffsâ€™ antitrust
claimsâ€”the sole claim raised in the
Gelboim-Zacher complaint. Assuming that the Gelboim-Zacher
plaintiffs were entitled to an immediate appeal of right under
Â§1291 because their suit had been
â€œdismissed in [its] entirety,â€ App.
to Pet. for Cert. 219a, the District Court granted Rule 54(b)
certifications to the OTC and Exchange plaintiffs authorizing them
to appeal the dismissal of their antitrust claims while their other
claims remained pending in the District Court.

															On its own initiative, the Second Circuit dismissed the
Gelboim-Zacher appeal because the â€œorde[r]
appealed from did not dispose of all claims in the consolidated
action.â€ Id., at 2a.[2] The
District Court thereafter withdrew its Rule 54(b) certifications in
the OTC and Exchange plaintiffsâ€™ actions and,
â€œgiven the reaction of the Second
Circuit,â€ App. 294, denied
petitionersâ€™ request for a Rule 54(b)
certification.

															We granted review of the Second Circuitâ€™s
judgment dismissing the Gelboim-Zacher appeal. 573
U.Â S. ___ (2014). Before this Court, petitioners
Gelboim and Zacher contend that the order dismissing their case in
its entirety removed them from the consolidated proceeding, thereby
triggering their right to appeal under Â§1291.
Respondent banks urge that consolidated cases proceed as one unit
for the duration of the consolidation. Consequently, they maintain,
there is no appeal of right from an order dismissing fewer than all
consolidated claims, thus the sole avenue for appeal while the
consolidation continues is Rule 54(b). Agreeing with Gelboim and
Zacher, we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™
judgment.

															III

															Cases consolidated for MDL pretrial proceedings ordinarily
retain their separate identities,[3] so an order
disposing of one of the discrete cases in its entirety should
qual-ify under Â§1291 as an appealable final decision.
Section 1407 refers to individual
â€œactionsâ€ which may be transferred
to a single district court, not to any monolithic multidistrict
â€œactionâ€ created by transfer. See
Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &
Lerach,523 U. S. 26,37 (1998) (Â§1407 does not
â€œimbu[e] transferred actions with some new and
distinctive . . . characterâ€).[4] And
Congress anticipated that, during the pendency of pretrial
proceedings, final decisions might be rendered in one or more of
the actions consolidated pursuant to Â§1407. It
specified that â€œat or before the conclusion of
.Â .Â . pretrial proceedings,â€
each of the transferred actions must be remanded to the originating
district â€œunless [the action] shall have been
previously terminated.â€ Â§1407(a)
(emphasis added).

															The District Courtâ€™s order dismissing the
Gelboim-Zacher complaint for lack of antitrust injury, without
leave to amend, had the hallmarks of a final decision. Ruling on
the merits of the case, the District Court completed its
adjudication of petitionersâ€™ complaint and
terminated their action. As a result of the District
Courtâ€™s disposition, petitioners are no longer
participants in the consolidated proceedings. Nothing about the
initial consolidation of their civil action with other cases in the
LIBOR MDL renders the dismissal of their complaint in any way
tentative or incomplete. As is ordinarily the case, the
Â§1407 consolidation offered convenience for the parties
and promoted efficient judicial administration, but did not meld
the Gelboim-Zacher action and others in the MDL into a single unit.
Cf. supra, at 6, n.Â 3.[5]

															The banksâ€™ view that, in a Â§1407
consolidation, no appeal of right accrues until the consolidation
ends would leave plaintiffs like Gelboim and Zacher in a quandary
about the proper timing of their appeals. Under Federal Rule of
Appellate Procedure 4, which this Court has called
â€œjurisdictional,â€ Bowles v.
Russell,551 U.Â S. 205,209 (2007), a notice of
appeal in a civil case must be filed â€œwithin 30
days after entry of the judgment or order appealed
from,â€ Rule 4(a)(1)(A). If plaintiffs whose actions
have been dismissed with prejudice by a district court must await
the termination of pretrial proceedings in all consolidated cases,
what event or order would start the 30-day clock? When pretrial
consolidation concludes, there may be no occasion for the entry of
any judgment. Orders may issue returning cases to their originating
courts,[6] but an order of that genre would not
qualify as the dispositive ruling Gelboim and Zacher seek to
overturn on appeal. And surely would-be appellants need not await
final disposition of all cases in their originating districts, long
after pretrial consolidation under Â§1407 could even
arguably justify treating the cases as a judicial unit.

															The sensible solution to the appeal-clock trigger is evident:
When the transferee court overseeing pretrial proceedings in
multidistrict litigation grants a defendantâ€™s
dispositive motion â€œon all issues in some
transferred cases, [those cases] become immediately appealable
.Â .Â . while cases where other issues remain
would not be appealable at that time.â€ D. Herr,
Multidistrict Litigation Manual Â§9:21, p. 312
(2014).

															The banks express concern that plaintiffs with the weakest cases
may be positioned to appeal because their complaint states only one
claim, while plaintiffs with stronger cases will be unable to
appeal simultaneously because they have other claims still pending.
Brief for Respondents 46â€“47. Rule 54(b) attends
to this concern. District courts may grant certifications under
that Rule, thereby enabling plaintiffs in actions that have not
been dismissed in their entirety to pursue immediate appellate
review. That is just what happened in this very case. The District
Court granted Rule 54(b) certifications to the OTC and Exchange
plaintiffs so they could appeal at the same time Gelboim and Zacher
could. See supra, at 5. And if the MDL court believes that
further proceedings might be relevant to a claim a defendant moves
to dismiss, the court ordinarily can defer ruling on the motion,
thus allowing all plaintiffs to participate in the ongoing MDL
proceedings.

															While Rule 54(b) can aid parties with multiple-claim
complaintsâ€”here, the OTC and Exchange
plaintiffs, supra, at 5â€”the Rule,
properly read, is of no avail to Gelboim and Zacher. Rule 54(b)
addresses orders finally adjudicating fewer than all claims
presented in a civil action complaint. It â€œdoes
not apply to a single claim action nor to a multiple claims action
in which all of the claims have been finally decided.â€
Mackey, 351 U.Â S., at 435; see Liberty Mut.
Ins. Co. v. Wetzel,424 U.Â S.
737â€“743 (1976) (Rule 54(b) inapplicable where
â€œcomplaint advanced a single legal theory which
was applied to only one set of factsâ€). In short, Rule
54(b) is designed to permit acceleration of appeals in
multiple-claim cases, not to retard appeals in single-claim
cases.[7]

															Section 1292(b), the banks conceded at argument, see Tr. of Oral
Arg. 40â€“41, is inapposite here. It allows
district courts to designate for review interlocutory orders
â€œnot otherwise appealable,â€ where
immediate appeal â€œmay materially advance the
ultimate termination of the litigation.â€
Â§1292(b). The designation may be accepted or rejected
in the discretion of the court of appeals. Ibid. See
generally Solimine, Revitalizing Interlocutory Appeals in the
Federal Courts, 58 Geo. Wash. L.Â Rev. 1165 (1990);
Note, Interlocutory Appeals in the Federal Courts Under 28
U.Â S.Â C. Â§1292(b), 88 Harv.
L.Â Rev. 607 (1975). It suffices to note that there is
nothing â€œinterlocutoryâ€ about the
dismissal order in the Gelboim-Zacher action.

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the
U.Â S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit deeming
the District Courtâ€™s dismissal of the
Gelboim-Zacher complaint unripe for appellate review, and we remand
the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1Â Compare Rule 54(b), which
lodges discretion to authorize appeals in district courts, with
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), which authorizes courts of
appeals to permit an immediate appeal from a district court order
granting or denying class-action certification.
2Â The Second Circuit
â€œstrong[ly] presum[es]â€ that a
â€œjudgment in a consolidated [proceeding] that
does not dispose of all [consolidated] claims
.Â .Â . is not appealable absent Rule 54(b)
certification.â€ Hageman v. City Investing
Co., 851 F. 2d 69, 71 (1988). In this regard, the Circuit does
not differentiate between all-purpose consolidations, see
ibid. (actions â€œcould originally have
been brought as one actionâ€ and there was
â€œno indication that the cases were consolidated
only for limited purposesâ€); Houbigant, Inc. v.
IMG Fragrance Brands, LLC, 627 F. 3d 497, 498 (2010)
(actions consolidated â€œfor all
purposesâ€), and, as this case illustrates,
Â§1407 consolidations for pretrial proceedings only. The
presumption may be overcome in â€œhighly unusual
circumstances,â€ Hageman, 851 F.Â 2d,
at 71, but the Second Circuit has not elaborated on what
those circumstances might be.
3Â Parties may elect to file a
â€œmaster complaintâ€ and a
corresponding â€œconsolidated answer,â€
which supersede prior individual pleadings. In such a case, the
transferee court may treat the master pleadings as merging the
discrete actions for the duration of the MDL pretrial proceedings.
InÂ re Refrigerant Compressors Antitrust
Litigation, 731 F.Â 3d 586,
590â€“592 (CA6 2013). No merger occurs, however,
when â€œthe master complaint is not meant to be a
pleading with legal effect but only an administrative summary of
the claims brought by all the plaintiffs.â€ Id.,
at 590.
4Â We express no opinion on
whether an order deciding one of multiple cases combined in an
all-purpose consolidation qualifies under Â§1291 as a
final decision appealable of right. See Brown v. United
States, 976 F. 2d 1104, 1107 (CA7 1992) (cases consolidated for
all purposes â€œbecome a single judicial
unit,â€ but where the consolidation is for limited
purposes only, â€œa decision disposing of all the
claims in only one of the cases is a final decision subject to
immediate appealâ€).
5Â In delineating the narrow
scope of the â€œcollateral-orderâ€
doctrine, we have cautioned against permitting piecemeal,
prejudgment appeals. Those admonitions, cited by the banks,
Brief for Respondents 18â€“19, are not pertinent
here. Under the collateral order doctrine, an order may be deemed
â€œfinalâ€ if it disposes of a matter
â€œseparable from, and collateral toâ€
the merits of the main proceeding, â€œtoo
important to be denied review,â€ and
â€œtoo independent of the cause itself to require
that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is
adjudicated.â€ Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial
Loan Corp.,337 U.Â S. 541,546 (1949). The order
dismissing the Gelboim-Zacher complaint in its entirety was in no
sense â€œcollateral,â€ i.e.,
â€œindependent of the cause itself.â€
Scarcely a prejudgment ruling, the dismissal order left
nothing still pending decision in the District Court.
6Â In fact,
â€œ[f]ew cases [consolidated pursuant to
Â§1407] are remanded for trial; most multidistrict
litigation is settled in the transferee court.â€ Manual
for Complex Litigation Â§20.132, p. 223 (4th ed.
2004).
7Â We need not decide whether or
how Rule 54(b) applies to cases consolidated for all purposes
involving closely related issues, actions that could have been
brought under the umbrella of one complaint. Cf. supra, at
7, n.Â 4. The Rule surely was not designed to apply to
numerous actions that the MDL panel combines for efficient pretrial
proceedings because they have in common â€œone or
more questions of fact,â€ but otherwise vary in
character.
