															T-MOBILE SOUTH, LLC, PETITIONER v.CITY OF ROSWELL,
GEORGIA

															on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for
the eleventh circuit

															[January 14, 2015]

															Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court.

															The Telecommunications Act of 1996 provides, in relevant part,
that â€œ[a]ny decision by a State or local
government or instrumentality thereof to deny a request to place,
construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities shall be
in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a
written record.â€110Stat.151,47
U.Â S.Â C. Â§332(c)(7)(B)(iii).
The question presented is whether, and in what form, localities
must provide reasons when they deny telecommunication
companiesâ€™ applications to construct cell phone
towers. We hold that localities must provide or make available
their reasons, but that those reasons need not appear in the
written denial letter or notice provided by the locality. Instead,
the localityâ€™s reasons may appear in some other
written record so long as the reasons are sufficiently clear and
are provided or made accessible to the applicant essentially
contemporaneously with the written denial letter or notice.

															I

															In February 2010, petitioner T-Mobile South, LLC, applied to
build a new, 108-foot-tall cell phone tower on 2.8 acres of vacant
residential property in the city of Ros-well, Georgia (City).
Roswellâ€™s city ordinances requirethat any cell
phone tower proposed for a residential zoning district must take
the form of an â€œalternative tower
structureâ€â€”an artificial tree, clock
tower, steeple, or light poleâ€”that, in the
opinion of the city council (City Council or Council), is
â€œcompatible with the natural setting and
surrounding structuresâ€ and that effectively
camouflages the tower. Code of Ordinances
Â§Â§21.2.2, 21.2.5(a); see App. 68, 75. In
accordance with these provisions, petitionerâ€™s
application proposed a structure in the shape of an artificial tree
or â€œmonopine.â€ Id., at
42.

															The Cityâ€™s Planning and Zoning Division
reviewed petitionerâ€™s application, along with a
substantial number of letters and petitions opposing it, and
ultimately issued a memorandum to the City Council concluding that
the application met all of the requirements set out in the
Cityâ€™s ordinances. It recommended that the City
Council approve the application on three conditions to which
petitioner was prepared to agree.

															The City Council then held a 2-hour-long public hearing on April
12, 2010, to consider petitionerâ€™s application.
Petitioner arranged privately to have the hearing transcribed, and,
as discussed below, the City subsequently issued detailed minutes
summarizing the proceedings. At the hearing, after the Planning and
Zoning Division presented its recommendation and after
petitionerâ€™s representatives made a presentation
in support of the application, a number of residents raised
concerns. Among these were concerns that the tower would lack
aesthetic compatibility, that the technology was outdated and
unnecessary, and that the tower would be too tall.
Petitionerâ€™s representatives responded by
reiterating that it had met all of the
ordinanceâ€™s requirements and by providing
testimony from a property appraiser that placement of cell phone
towers does not reduce property values.

															Members of the City Council then commented on the application.
One member of the six-person Council was recused, see id.,
at 111 (hearing transcript); id., at 322 (meeting minutes),
leaving five voting members. Member Igleheart said that other
carriers had sufficient coverage in the area and that the City did
not need to level the playing field for petitioner. Id., at
173â€“174 (hearing transcript). He also stated
that his â€œ[b]ottom lineâ€ was that he
did not think it was â€œappropriate for
residentially zoned properties to have the cell towers in their
location.â€ Id., at 174 (hearing transcript);
id., at 338 (meeting minutes). Member Dippolito found it
difficult to believe that the tower would not negatively impact the
area and doubted that it would be compatible with the natural
setting. Id., at 175â€“176 (hearing
transcript); id., at 339 (meeting minutes). Member Wynn
expressed concerns about the lack of a backup generator for
emergency services, id., at 172 (hearing transcript), and
did not think the tower would be â€œcompatible
with this area,â€ id., at 176 (hearing
transcript); id., at 339 (meeting minutes). Member Orlans
said only that he was impressed with the information put together
by both sides. Id., at 173 (hearing transcript); id.,
at 337 (meeting minutes). Finally, Member Price, the liaison to the
Planning and Zoning Division, made a motion to deny the
application. She said that the tower would be aesthetically
incompatible with the natural setting, that it would be too tall,
and that its proximity to other homes would adversely affect the
neighbors and the resale value of their properties. Id., at
176â€“177 (hearing transcript); id., at
339â€“340 (meeting minutes). The motion was
seconded, and then passed unanimously. Id., at 177 (hearing
transcript); id., at 340 (meeting minutes).

															Two days later, on April 14, 2010, the Planning and Zoning
Division sent a letter to petitioner that said in its entirety:

															â€œPlease be advised the City of Roswell Mayor
and City Council denied the request from T-Mobile for a
108â€™ mono-pine alternative tower structure
during their April 12, 2010 hearing. The minutes from the
aforementioned hearing may be obtained from the city clerk. Please
contact Sue Creel or Betsy Branch at [phone number].

															â€œIf you have any additional questions, please
contact me at [phone number].â€ Id., at 278.

															The detailed written minutes of the hearing, however, were not
approved and published by the City until 26 days later, on May 10,
2010. See id., at 321â€“341 (meeting
minutes).[1]

															On May 13, 2010, 3 days after the detailed minutes were
publishedâ€”and now 29 days after the City denied
petitionerâ€™s
applicationâ€”petitioner filed suit in Federal
District Court. It alleged that the denial of the application was
not supported by substantial evidence in the record, and would
effectively prohibit the provision of wireless service in violation
of the Telecommunications Act of1996 (Act). The parties filed
cross-motions for summary judgment.

															The District Court granted petitionerâ€™s
motion for summary judgment, concluding that the City had violated
the Act when it failed to issue a written decision that stated the
reasons for denying petitionerâ€™s application.
The District Court interpreted the Act to require that a written
denial letter or notice describe the reasons for the denial and
that those reasons be sufficiently explained to allow a reviewing
court to evaluate them against the written record.

															The Eleventh Circuit reversed. 731 F.Â 3d 1213
(2013). It explained that, in T-Mobile South, LLC v.
Milton, 728 F.Â 3d 1274 (2013), which was decided
after the District Courtâ€™s decision in this
case, it had held that â€œto the extent that the
decision must contain grounds or reasons or explanations, it is
sufficient if those are contained in a different written document
or documents that the applicant is given or has access
to.â€ Id., at 1285. The Eleventh Circuit
acknowledged that the Courts of Appeals had split on that question,
and that it had departed from the majority rule. Compare
Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc. v. Todd, 244
F. 3d 51, 60 (CA1 2001) (requiring that a locality issue a written
denial that itself contains a â€œsufficient
explanation of the reasons for the permit denial to allow a
reviewing court to evaluate the evidence in the record supporting
those reasonsâ€); New Par v. Saginaw, 301
F. 3d 390, 395â€“396 (CA6 2002); MetroPCS,
Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco, 400 F. 3d 715,
723 (CA9 2005), with AT&T Wireless PCS, Inc. v. City
Council of Virginia Beach, 155 F. 3d 423, 429 (CA4 1998)
(holding that written minutes of a meeting and the word
â€œdeniedâ€ stamped on a letter
describing the application weresufficient). Applying its rule to
this case, the Eleventh Circuit found that the requirements of47
U.Â S.Â C. Â§332(c)(7)(B)(iii)
were satisfied because petitioner had its own transcript as well as
a written letter stating that the application had been denied and
informing petitioner that it could obtain access to the minutes of
the hearing. 731 F.Â 3d, at 1221. It did not consider
when the City provided its written reasons to petitioner.

															We granted certiorari, 572 U.Â S. ___ (2014), and now
reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit.

															II

															A

															The first question we answer is whether the statute requires
localities to provide reasons when they deny applications to build
cell phone towers. We answer that question in the affirmative.

															Our conclusion follows from the provisions of the
Telecommunications Act. The Act generally preserves
â€œthe traditional authority of state and local
governments to regulate the location, construction, and
modificationâ€ of wireless communications facilities
like cell phone towers, but imposes â€œspecific
limitationsâ€ on that authority. Rancho Palos
Verdes v. Abrams,544 U. S. 113,115 (2005); see
Â§332(c)(7)(B). One of those limitations is that any
decision to deny a request to build a tower
â€œshall be in writing and supported by
substantial evidence contained in a written record.â€
Â§332(c)(7)(B)(iii). Another is that parties adversely
affected by a localityâ€™s decision may seek
judicial review. Â§332(c)(7)(B)(v). In order to
determine whether a localityâ€™s denial was
supported by substantial evidence, as Congress directed, courts
must be able to identify the reason or reasons why the locality
denied the application. See Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S.,
at 128 (Breyer, J., joined by Oâ€™Connor, Souter,
and Ginsburg, JJ., concurring) (observing that the Act
â€œrequires local zoning boards
.Â .Â . [to] give reasons for [their] denials
â€˜in
writingâ€™Â â€).

															The requirement that localities must provide reasons when they
deny applications is further underscored by two of the other
limitations on local authority set out in the Act. The Act provides
that localities â€œshall not unreason-ably
discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent
services,â€ and may not regulate the construction of
personal wireless service facilities â€œon the
basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to
the extent that such facilities comply with the [Federal
Communications Commissionâ€™s] regulations
concerning such emissions.â€
Â§Â§332(c)(7)(B)(i)(I), (iv).[2] Again, it would be considerably more difficult for a
reviewing court to determine whether a locality had violated these
substantive provisions if the locality were not obligated to state
its reasons.

															This conclusion is not just commonsensical, but flows directly
from Congressâ€™ use of the term
â€œsubstantial evidence.â€ The
statutory phrase â€œsubstantial
evidenceâ€ is a â€œterm of
artâ€ in administrative law that describes how
â€œan administrative record is to be judged by a
reviewing court.â€ United States v. Carlo
Bianchi & Co.,373 U. S. 709,715 (1963). There is no reason
discernible from the text of the Act to think that Congress meant
to use the phrase in a different way. See FAA v.
Cooper, 566 U.Â S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at
6) (â€œ[W]hen Congress employs a term of art, it
presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached
to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was
takenâ€ (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, for
those who consider legislative history relevant, the Conference
Report accompanying the Act confirmed as much when it noted that
â€œ[t]he phrase â€˜substantial
evidence contained in a written recordâ€™ is the
traditional standard used for review of agency
actions.â€ H. R. Conf. Rep. No.
104â€“458, p. 208 (1996).

															By employing the term â€œsubstantial
evidence,â€ Congress thus invoked, among other things,
our recognition that â€œthe orderly functioning of
the process of [substantial-evidence] review requires that the
grounds upon which the administrative agency acted be clearly
disclosed,â€ and that â€œcourts cannot
exercise their duty of [substantial-evidence] review unless they
are advised of the considerations underlying the action under
review.â€ SEC v. Chenery Corp.,318 U. S.
80,94 (1943); see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United
States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins.
Co.,463 U.Â S. 29,43 (1983) (explaining that an
agency must â€œarticulate a satisfactory
explanation for its actionâ€ to enable
substantial-evidence review); Beaumont,
S.Â L. & W. R. Co.
v. United States,282 U. S. 74,86 (1930)
(â€œComplete statements by the [agency] showing
the grounds upon which its determinations rest are quite as
necessary as are opinions of lower courts setting forth the reasons
on which they base their decisions
.Â .Â .â€).

															In response, the City primarily argues that a reason-giving
obligation would deprive it of local zoning author-ity. But
Congress intended to place â€œspecific limitations
on the traditional authority of state and local
governmentsâ€ regarding cell phone tower siting
applications. Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U. S., at 115. One of
those â€œlimitations,â€
Â§332(c)(7)(B), necessarily implied by the
Actâ€™s â€œsubstantial
evidenceâ€ requirement, is that local zoning authorities
state their reasons when they deny applications.

															In short, the statutory text and structure, and the concepts
that Congress imported into the statutory framework, all point
clearly toward the conclusion that localities must provide reasons
when they deny cell phone tower siting applications. We stress,
however, that these reasons need not be elaborate or even
sophisticated, but rather, as discussed below, simply clear enough
to enable judicial review.

															B

															The second question we answer is whether these reasons must
appear in the same writing that conveys the
localityâ€™s denial of an application. We answer
that question in the negative.

															Like our conclusion that localities must provide reasons, our
conclusion that the reasons need not appear in a de-nial letter
follows from the statutory text. Other than providing that a
localityâ€™s reasons must be given in writing,
nothing in that text imposes any requirement that the reasons be
given in any particular form.

															The Actâ€™s saving clause makes clear that,
other than the enumerated limitations imposed on local governments
by the statute itself, â€œnothing in this chapter
shall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government
or instrumentality thereof over decisions regarding the placement,
construction, and modification of personal wireless service
facilities.â€ Â§332(c)(7)(A). Given this
language, and the system of â€œcooperative
federalismâ€ on which the Act is premised, Rancho
Palos Verdes, 544 U.Â S., at 128 (Breyer, J.,
concurring), we understand the enumerated limitations to set out an
exclusive list. So while the text and structure of the Act render
it inescapable that localities must provide reasons in writing when
they deny applications, we can locate in the Act no
commandâ€”either explicit or
implicitâ€”that localities must provide those
reasons in a specific document.

															We therefore conclude that Congress imposed no specific
requirement on that front, but instead permitted localities to
comply with their obligation to give written reasons so long as the
localityâ€™s reasons are stated clearly enough to
enable judicial review. Although the statute does not require a
locality to provide its written reasons in any particular format,
and although a locality may rely on detailed meeting minutes as it
did here, we agree with the Solicitor General that
â€œthe local government may be better served by
including a separate statement containing its reasons.â€
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26; see also
id., at 34. If the locality writes a short statement
providing its reasons, the locality can likely avoid prolonging the
litigationâ€”and adding expense to the taxpayers,
the companies, and the legal systemâ€”while the
parties argue about exactly what the sometimes voluminous record
means. Moreover, in that circumstance, the locality need not worry
that, upon review of the record, a court will either find that it
could not ascertain the localityâ€™s reasons or
mistakenly ascribe to the locality a rationale that was not in fact
the reason for the localityâ€™s denial.

															We hasten to add that a locality cannot stymie or burden the
judicial review contemplated by the statute by delaying the release
of its reasons for a substantial time after it conveys its written
denial. The statute provides that an entity adversely affected by a
localityâ€™s decision may seek judicial review
within 30 days of the decision. Â§332(c)(7)(B)(v).
Because an entity may not be able to make a considered decision
whether to seek judicial review without knowing the reasons for the
denial of its application, and because a court cannot review the
denial without knowing the localityâ€™s reasons,
the locality must provide or make available its written reasons at
essentially the same time as it communicates its denial.[3]

															This rule ought not to unduly burden localities given the range
of ways in which localities can provide their reasons. Moreover,
the denial itself needs only to be issued (or the application
otherwise acted upon) â€œwithin a reasonable
period of time.â€ Â§332(c)(7)(B)(ii). In an
interpretation we have recently upheld, see Arlington v.
FCC, 569 U.Â S. ___ (2013), the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) has generally interpreted this
provision to allow localities 90 days to act on applications to
place new antennas on existing towers and 150 days to act on other
siting applications. In re Petition for Declaratory Ruling to
Clarify Provisions of Section 332(c)(7)(b), 24 FCC Rcd. 13994,
13995, Â¶4 (2009). If a locality is not in a position to
provide its reasons promptly, the locality can delay the issuance
of its denial within this 90- or 150-day window, and instead
release it along with its reasons once those reasons are ready to
be provided. Only once the denial is issued would the 30-day
commencement-of-suit clock begin.[4]

															III

															Petitioner offers four reasons why, in its view, our analysis in
Part IIâ€“B is incorrect. Petitioner argues that
the statute requires that a localityâ€™s reasons
appear in the writing conveying the denial itself, but none of
petitionerâ€™s reasons are persuasive.

															First, petitioner argues that the word
â€œdecisionâ€ in the
statuteâ€”the thing that must be
â€œin
writingâ€â€”connotes a written document
that itself provides all the reasons for a given judgment. See
Brief for Petitioner 24 (quoting Blackâ€™s Law
Dictionary 407 (6th ed. 1990) (a
â€œdecisionâ€ is a written document
providing â€œÂ â€˜the
reasons given for [a]
judgmentâ€™Â â€)). But even
petitioner concedes, with its preferred dictionary in hand, that
the word â€œdecisionâ€ can also mean
â€œsomething short of a statement of reasons
explaining a determination.â€ Brief for Petitioner 24
(citing Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary, at
407).[5]

															Second, petitioner claims that other provisions in the Act use
the word â€œnotifyâ€ when the Act means
to impose only a requirement that a judgment be
communicated.[6] Because the provision at issue
here does not use the word â€œnotify,â€
petitioner argues, it must contemplate something more than a
judgment. This does not logically follow. For one thing, the
statute at issue here does not use any verb at all to describe the
conveying of information from a locality to an applicant; it just
says that a denial â€œshall be in writing and
supported by substantial evidence contained in a written
record.â€ Â§332(c)(7)(B)(iii). But more to
the point, â€œnotifyâ€ is a verb the
useâ€”or nonuseâ€”of which does
not reveal what the thing to be notified of or about is.

															Third, petitioner contends that the
â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ requirement
itself demands that localities identify their reasons in their
written denials. See Brief for Petitioner 23. Certainly, as
discussed above, the phrase â€œsubstantial
evidenceâ€ requires localities to give reasons, but it
says nothing on its own about the document in which those reasons
must be stated or presented to a reviewing court.

															Finally, petitioner invokes the statutory requirement that any
adversely affected person shall have their challenge heard by a
court â€œon an expedited basis.â€
Â§332(c)(7)(B)(v). See Brief for Petitioner
14â€“15, 28. As long as the reasons are provided
in a written record, however, and as long as they are provided in
such a manner that is clear enough and prompt enough to enable
judicial review, there is no reason to require that those reasons
be provided in the written denial itself.

															We acknowledge that petitioner, along with those Courts of
Appeals that have required a localityâ€™s reasons
to appear in its written denial itself, have offered plausible
bases for a rule that would require as much. See, e.g.,
Todd, 244 F.Â 3d, at 60 (â€œA
written record can create difficulties in determining the rationale
behind a boardâ€™s decision
.Â .Â .â€). Congress could adopt
such a rule if it were so inclined, but it did not do so in this
statute. It is not our place to legislate another approach.

															IV

															Thus, we hold that the Act requires localities to provide
reasons when they deny cell phone tower siting applications, but
that the Act does not require localities to provide those reasons
in written denial letters or notices themselves. A locality may
satisfy its statutory obligations if it states its reasons with
sufficient clarity in some other written record issued essentially
contemporaneously with the denial. In this case, the City provided
its reasons in writing and did so in the acceptable form of
detailed minutes of the City Council meeting. The City, however,
did not provide its written reasons essentially contemporaneously
with its written denial. Instead, the City issued those detailed
minutes 26 days after the date of the written denial and just 4
days before petitionerâ€™s time to seek judicial
review would have expired.[7] The City therefore
did not comply with its statutory obligations. We do not consider
questions regarding the applicability of principles of harmless
error or questions of remedy, and leave those for the Eleventh
Circuit to address on remand.

															
*â€ƒâ€ƒ*â€ƒâ€ƒ*

															For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment below and
remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

															It is so ordered.

Notes
1Â Brief minutes had been adopted
on April 19, but these only noted that the motion to deny the
application had passed with five members in favor and one member
recused. See Council Brief 041210, online at
http://Â roswell.legistar.comÂ /Â LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=657578&GUID=08D5297C-0271-41F9-9DAA-E8E3DD6314BD&Options=&Search=
(all In-ternet Materials as visited January 12, 2015, and available
in Clerk of Courtâ€™s case file). According to the
meeting calendar for the City Councilâ€™s May 10,
2010, meeting, it was on that day that the City Council approved
detailed minutes of the April 12 meeting that in-cluded a
recitation of each memberâ€™s statements during
the hearing. See
httpÂ :/Â /Â roswell.legistar.comÂ /Â MeetingDetail.aspx?IDÂ =Â 101786&GUIDÂ =Â 63828B21-EB83-4485-B4EA-10EE65CF48CD&Options=info|&Search=.
2Â The last
â€œlimitationâ€ listed in the Act
provides that localities shall act on applications to construct
personal wireless service facilities â€œwithin a
reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed
.Â .Â . taking into account the nature and
scope of such request.â€
Â§332(c)(7)(B)(ii).
3Â The Chief
Justiceâ€™s dissent rejects this particular
requirement, and instead invents a process that turns judicial
review on its head. Rather than give effect to a process that would
permit an entity seeking to challenge a
localityâ€™s decision to see the
localityâ€™s written reasons before it files its
suitâ€”and the dissent agrees that the statute
requires that a locality convey its reasons in writing, see
post, at 5â€”the dissent would fashion a
world in which a locality can wait until a lawsuit is commenced and
a court orders it to state its reasons. The entity would thus be
left to guess at what the localityâ€™s written
reasons will be, write a complaint that contains those hypotheses,
and risk being sandbagged by the written reasons that the locality
subsequently provides in litigation after the challenging entity
has shown its cards. The reviewing court would then need to ensure
that those reasons are not postÂ hoc
rationalizations, see Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.
United States,371 U.Â S. 156,168 (1962), but the
dissent offers no guidance as to how a reviewing court that has
never seen near-contemporaneous reasons would conduct that
inquiry.
4Â The City urges us to hold that
the clock does not begin to run until after the reasons are given.
We cannot so hold, however, without rewriting the statutory text.
The Act provides that a lawsuit may be filed by
â€œ[a]ny person adversely affected by any final
action or failure to act .Â .Â . within 30
days after such action or failure to act.â€47
U.Â S.Â C. Â§332(c)(7)(B)(v). The
relevant â€œfinal actionâ€ is the
issuance of the written notice of denial, not the subsequent
issuance of reasons explaining the denial. See Bennett v.
Spear,520 U. S. 154â€“178 (1997) (agency
action is â€œfinalâ€ if it
â€œmark[s] the consummation of the
agencyâ€™s decisionmaking processâ€ and
determines â€œrights or obligationsâ€
or triggers â€œlegal consequencesâ€
(internal quotation marks omitted)).
5Â One of
petitionerâ€™s amici argues that Congress
has used the word â€œdecisionâ€ in the
context of other communications laws to mean something more than a
judgment or verdict. See Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the
United States of America (Chamber) etÂ al.
9â€“13. But while it is true that a word used
across â€œthe same actâ€ should be
given the same meaning, see Taniguchi v. Kan Pacific
Saipan, Ltd., 566 U.Â S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op.,
at 10), the Chamberâ€™s evidence is less
persuasive because it arises out of entirely different
â€œactsâ€ and does not involve any term
of art. By relying on other parts of Title 47 of the
U.Â S. Codeâ€”some enacted in the
Communications Act of 1934 decades before the enactment of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 at issue hereâ€”the
Chamber stretches to invoke this canon of construction beyond its
most forceful application. See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading
Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 172â€“173
(2012).
6Â For example, petitioner cites
Â§11 (FCC must â€œnotify the
partiesconcernedâ€ when it makes a
â€œdetermination and orderâ€ regarding
a rail-road or telegraph companyâ€™s failure to
maintain and operate a telegraph line for public use) and
Â§398(b)(5) (â€œWhenever the Secretary
[of Commerce] makes a final determination
.Â .Â . that a recipientâ€ of
federal funds has engaged in impermissible discrimination, the
Secretary shall â€œnotify the recipient in writing
of such determination .Â .Â .â€).
Brief for Petitioner 24â€“25.
7Â Though petitioner arranged for
a transcript of the meeting to be recorded on its own initiative
and at its own expense, see App. 109â€“275, the
fact that petitioner took steps to reduce oral statements made at
the City Council meeting to writing cannot be said to satisfy the
obligation that Congress placed on the City to state clearly its
reasons, and to do so in a writing it provides or makes
available.
