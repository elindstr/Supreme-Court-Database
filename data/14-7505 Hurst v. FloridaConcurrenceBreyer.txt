															TIMOTHY LEE HURST, PETITIONER v. FLORIDA

															on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of florida

															[January 12, 2016]

															

															Justice Breyer, concurring in the judgment.

															For the reasons explained in my opinion concurring in the judgment in Ring v. Arizona,

536 U. S. 584
–619 (2002), I cannot join the Court’s opinion.  As in that case, however, I concur in the judgment here based on my view that “the
 
Eighth Amendment requires that a jury, not a judge, make the decision to sentence a defendant to death.”  Id., at 614; see id., at 618 (“[T]he danger of unwarranted imposition of the [death] penalty cannot be avoided unless ‘the decision to impose the death penalty is made by a jury rather than by a single government official’ ” (quoting Spaziano v. Florida,

468 U. S. 447,
469 (1984)
 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part))).  No one argues that Florida’s juries actually sentence capital defendants to death—that job is left to Flor-ida’s judges.  See Fla. Stat. §921.141(3) (2010).  Like the majority, therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court.
