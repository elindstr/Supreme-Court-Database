# Supreme-Court-Database
A complete database of all decisions by the United States Supreme Court ()

## Code Description

A python script that downloads to text files the complete set of decisions by the Supreme Court from a public-domain database<sup>1</sup> (01_scrape.py), identifies exclamation mark usage by decision (02_search.py), and then analyses the usage (03_analysis.py).  

<sup>1</sup> In <i>Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.</i>, 499 U. S. 340 (1991), the Supreme Court held that a directory of publicly available residential telephone numbers was not protected by copyright and could be scrape by a rival publisher. The held that factual compilations do not enjoy copyright protection absent the publisher making creative choices as to selection or arrangement. The Supreme Court publishes its decisions to the public domain organized by volume and page number. A database consisting of the complete set of Supreme Court decisions organized by volume and page number, like the telephone directory in <i>Feist</i>, does not enjoy copyright protection and can be freely used for any purpose.
